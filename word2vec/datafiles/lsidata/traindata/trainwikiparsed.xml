Many popular customs associated with Christmas developed independently of the commemoration of Jesus' birth, with certain elements having origins in pre-Christian festivals that were celebrated around the winter solstice by pagan populations who were later [[Christianization|converted to Christianity]].

===Relation to concurrent celebrations===
Prior to and through the [[Early Christianity|early Christian]] centuries, [[List of winter festivals|winter festivals]]—especially those centered on the [[winter solstice]]—were the most popular of the year in many European pagan cultures. Reasons included the fact that less agricultural work needed to be done during the winter, as well as an expectation of better weather as spring approached.&lt;ref name=AncientHoliday&gt;&quot;[http://www.history.com/minisites/christmas/viewPage?pageId=1252 &quot;Christmas – An Ancient Holiday&quot;], ''The [[History (U.S. TV channel)|History Channel]]'', 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Many modern Christmas customs have been directly influenced by such festivals, including gift-giving and merrymaking from the Roman [[Saturnalia]], greenery, lights, and charity from the Roman New Year, and [[Yule log]]s and various foods from [[Germanic paganism|Germanic]] feasts.&lt;ref&gt;Coffman, Elesha. [http://www.christianitytoday.com/history/newsletter/2000/dec08.html Why December 25?] ''Christian History &amp; Biography'', ''[[Christianity Today]]'', 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; The Egyptian deity [[Horus]], son to goddess [[Isis]], was celebrated at the winter solstice. Horus was often depicted being fed by his mother, which also influenced the symbolism of [[Madonna and Child|the Virgin Mary with baby Christ]].

[[Norse paganism|Pagan Scandinavia]] celebrated a winter festival called [[Yule]], held in the late December to early January period.&lt;ref name=&quot;SIMEK379&quot;&gt;Simek (2007:379).&lt;/ref&gt;  The word was in use in [[Old English]] (as ''geōl(a)'') by 900, to indicate Christmastide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/yule|title=Yule - Define Yule at Dictionary.com|work=Dictionary.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[American Heritage Dictionary]]'' defines the word as &quot;Christmas or the Christmas season, especially as traditionally celebrated in Northern Europe and North America with customs stemming in part from pagan celebrations of the winter solstice&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ahdictionary.com/word/search.html?q=yule|title=American Heritage Dictionary Entry: yule|publisher=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt Publishing Company}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[vikings]] celebrated to the honour of [[Norse mythology|their gods]] during three days, with much eating and drinking with friends and by-passers, called to ''drink Yule''. After the [[Christianisation]] of Scandinavia the celebration was allowed as long as it was in the name of Christ instead.

In eastern Europe also, old pagan traditions were incorporated into Christmas celebrations, an example being the [[Koleda]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopediaofukraine.com/pages%5CK%5CO%5CKoliadaIT.htm |title=Koliada |publisher=Encyclopediaofukraine.com |accessdate=November 19, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was incorporated into the [[Christmas carol]].

===Choice of December 25 date===
One theory to explain the choice of December 25 for the celebration of the birth of Jesus is that the purpose was to Christianize the pagan festival in Rome of the ''[[Sol Invictus#Festival of Dies Natalis Solis Invicti|Dies Natalis Solis Invicti]]'', meaning &quot;the birthday of the Unconquered Sun&quot;, a festival inaugurated by the Roman emperor [[Aurelian]] (270–275) to celebrate the sun god and celebrated at the winter solstice, December 25.&lt;ref name=&quot;Snyder2003&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Graydon F. Snyder|title=Ante Pacem: Archaeological Evidence of Church Life Before Constantine|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=swtI9Cpyl3kC&amp;pg=PA122|year=2003|publisher=Mercer University Press|isbn=978-0-86554-895-4|page=122}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Browning2009&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=W.

An explicit expression of this theory appears in an annotation of uncertain date added to a manuscript of a work by 12th-century Syrian bishop [[Jacob Bar-Salibi]]. The scribe who added it wrote: &quot;It was a custom of the Pagans to celebrate on the same 25&amp;nbsp;December the birthday of the Sun, at which they kindled lights in token of festivity. In these solemnities and revelries the Christians also took part. Accordingly when the doctors of the Church perceived that the Christians had a leaning to this festival, they took counsel and resolved that the true Nativity should be solemnised on that day.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;(cited in ''Christianity and Paganism in the Fourth to Eighth Centuries'', [[Ramsay MacMullen]]. Yale:1997, p. 155)&lt;/ref&gt; This idea became popular especially in the 18th and 19th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Alan Anderson, ''Symbols of Saints'' (ProQuest 2008 ISBN 978-0-54956551-2), p. 45&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://melkite.org/tag/feast-of-the-annunciation|title=» Feast of the Annunciation}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03724b.htm 1908 Catholic Encyclopedia: Christmas]: ''Natalis Invicti''&lt;/ref&gt;

One translation reads: &quot;O the splendid and divine providence of the Lord, that on that day, the very day, on which the sun was made, the 28 March, a Wednesday, Christ should be born.

With regard to a December religious feast of the sun as a god (Sol), as distinct from a solstice feast of the (re)birth of the astronomical sun, one scholar has commented that, &quot;while the winter solstice on or around December 25 was well established in the Roman imperial calendar, there is no evidence that a religious celebration of Sol on that day antedated the celebration of Christmas&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scribd.com/doc/33490806/Hijmans-Sol-The-Sun-in-the-Art-and-Religions-of-Rome S.E.

Christmas was promoted in the Christian East as part of the revival of [[Nicene Christianity]] following the death of the pro-[[Arianism|Arian]] Emperor [[Valens]] at the [[Battle of Adrianople]] in 378. The feast was introduced to [[Constantinople]] in 379, and to [[Antioch]] in about 380. The feast disappeared after [[Gregory of Nazianzus]] resigned as [[bishop]] in 381, although it was reintroduced by [[John Chrysostom]] in about 400.&lt;ref name=&quot;CathChrit&quot; /&gt;

===Middle Ages===
[[File:Nativity from Sherbrooke Missal cropped.jpg|thumb|left|''The Nativity'', from a 14th-century [[Missal]]; a liturgical book containing texts and music necessary for the celebration of Mass throughout the year]]
In the [[Early Middle Ages]], Christmas Day was overshadowed by Epiphany, which in [[western Christianity]] focused on the visit of the [[Biblical Magi|magi]]. But the medieval calendar was dominated by Christmas-related holidays. The forty days before Christmas became the &quot;forty days of St. Martin&quot; (which began on November 11, the feast of [[St. Martin of Tours]]), now known as Advent.&lt;ref name=&quot;Murray&quot; /&gt; In Italy, former [[Saturnalia]]n traditions were attached to Advent.&lt;ref name=&quot;Murray&quot;/&gt; Around the 12th century, these traditions transferred again to the [[Twelve Days of Christmas]] (December 25 – January 5); a time that appears in the liturgical calendars as Christmastide or Twelve Holy Days.&lt;ref name=&quot;Murray&quot;/&gt;

The prominence of Christmas Day increased gradually after [[Charlemagne]] was crowned Emperor on Christmas Day in 800. King [[Edmund the Martyr]] was anointed on Christmas in 855 and King [[William I of England]] was crowned on Christmas Day 1066.

[[File:Julius Schnorr von Carolsfeld (German - The Coronation of Charlemagne - Google Art Project.jpg|alt=|thumb|The coronation of Charlemagne on Christmas of 800 helped promote the popularity of the holiday]]

By the [[High Middle Ages]], the holiday had become so prominent that chroniclers routinely noted where various [[magnate]]s celebrated Christmas. [[Richard II of England|King Richard II]] of England hosted a Christmas feast in 1377 at which twenty-eight oxen and three hundred sheep were eaten.&lt;ref name=&quot;Murray&quot;/&gt; The Yule boar was a common feature of medieval Christmas feasts. [[Christmas carol|Caroling]] also became popular, and was originally a group of dancers who sang. The group was composed of a lead singer and a ring of dancers that provided the chorus.

However, in 17th century England, some groups such as the [[Puritan]]s, strongly condemned the celebration of Christmas, considering it a Catholic invention and the &quot;trappings of [[Papist|popery]]&quot; or the &quot;rags of [[The Beast (Bible)|the Beast]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Durston&quot; /&gt; In contrast, the established [[Church of England|Anglican Church]] &quot;pressed for a more elaborate observance of feasts, penitential seasons, and saints' days.

[[File:Scrooges third visitor-John Leech,1843 edit.jpg|thumb|right|[[Ebenezer Scrooge]] and the [[Ghost of Christmas Present]]. From [[Charles Dickens]]' ''[[A Christmas Carol]]'', 1843.]]
In the early 19th century, writers imagined [[Tudor period|Tudor]] Christmas as a time of heartfelt celebration. In 1843, [[Charles Dickens]] wrote the novel ''[[A Christmas Carol]]'' that helped revive the &quot;spirit&quot; of Christmas and seasonal merriment.&lt;ref name=standiford /&gt;&lt;ref name=AFP /&gt; Its instant popularity played a major role in portraying Christmas as a holiday emphasizing family, goodwill, and compassion.&lt;ref&gt;Rowell, Geoffrey, ''Dickens and the Construction of Christmas'', [[History Today]], Volume: 43 Issue: 12, December 1993, pp. 17 – 24&lt;/ref&gt;

Dickens sought to construct Christmas as a family-centered festival of generosity, in contrast to the community-based and church-centered observations, the observance of which had dwindled during the late 18th century and early 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ronald Hutton]] ''Stations of the Sun: The Ritual Year in England''. 1996.

In Britain, the [[Christmas tree#18th and 19th centuries|Christmas tree]] was introduced in the early 19th century following the personal union with the [[Kingdom of Hanover]] by [[Charlotte of Mecklenburg-Strelitz]], wife of [[George III of the United Kingdom|King George III]]. In 1832, the future [[Queen Victoria]] wrote about her delight at having a Christmas tree, hung with [[Christmas lights (holiday decoration)|lights]], [[Christmas ornaments|ornaments]], and [[presents]] placed round it.&lt;ref&gt;The girlhood of Queen Victoria: a selection from Her Majesty's diaries. p.61.

An image of the British royal family with their Christmas tree at Windsor Castle created a sensation when it was published in the ''[[Illustrated London News]]'' in 1848. A modified version of this image was published in the United States in 1850.&lt;ref name=&quot;Shoemaker&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[Godey's Lady's Book]]'', 1850.

In America, interest in Christmas had been revived in the 1820s by several [[Short story|short stories]] by [[Washington Irving]] which appear in his ''[[The Sketch Book of Geoffrey Crayon, Gent.]]'' and &quot;Old Christmas&quot;.

In 1822, [[Clement Clarke Moore]] wrote the poem ''[[A Visit From St. Nicholas]]'' (popularly known by its first line: ''Twas the Night Before Christmas'').&lt;ref&gt;Moore's poem transferred the genuine old Dutch traditions celebrated at New Year in New York, including the exchange of gifts, family feasting, and tales of &quot;sinterklass&quot; (a derivation in Dutch from &quot;Saint Nicholas&quot;, from whence comes the modern &quot;Santa Claus&quot;) to Christmas.[http://www.thehistoryofchristmas.com/ch/in_america.htm ''The history of Christmas: Christmas history in America''], 2006
&lt;/ref&gt;
The poem helped popularize the tradition of exchanging gifts, and seasonal Christmas shopping began to assume economic importance.&lt;ref&gt;usinfo.state.gov [http://usinfo.state.gov/scv/Archive/2005/Dec/19-344398.html &quot;Americans Celebrate Christmas in Diverse Ways&quot;] November 26, 2006

This also started the cultural conflict between the holiday's spiritual significance and its associated [[commercialism]] that some see as corrupting the holiday.

While the celebration of Christmas was not yet customary in some regions in the U.S., [[Henry Wadsworth Longfellow]] detected &quot;a transition state about Christmas here in New England&quot; in 1856. &quot;The old puritan feeling prevents it from being a cheerful, hearty holiday; though every year makes it more so.&quot;&lt;ref name=APH&gt;Restad, Penne L.

Up to the 1950s, in the UK, many Christmas customs were restricted to the upper classes and better-off families. The mass of the population had not adopted many of the Christmas rituals that later became general. The [[Christmas tree]] was rare. Christmas dinner might be beef — certainly not turkey. In their stockings children might get an apple, orange and sweets. Full celebration of a family Christmas with all the trimmings only became widespread with increased prosperity from the 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Weightman |first1=Gavin |last2=Humphries |first2=Steve |title=Christmas Past |date=1987 |publisher=Sidgwick and Jackson |location=London |page=31}}&lt;/ref&gt; National papers were published on Christmas Day until 1912.

==Customs and traditions==
{{main|Christmas traditions}}
[[File:Map of Countries that do not recognize Christmas as Public Holiday.png|thumbnail|right|300px|Map of countries where Christmas is not a formal public holiday either on December 24/25 or January 6/7.]]
Christmas Day is celebrated as a major festival and [[public holiday]] in countries around the world, including many whose populations are mostly non-Christian. In some non-Christian areas, periods of former colonial rule introduced the celebration (e.g. [[Hong Kong]]); in others, Christian minorities or foreign cultural influences have led populations to observe the holiday. Countries such as Japan, where Christmas is popular despite there being only a small number of Christians, have adopted many of the secular aspects of Christmas, such as gift-giving, decorations, and Christmas trees.

Countries in which Christmas is not a formal public holiday include [[Afghanistan]], [[Algeria]], [[Azerbaijan]], [[Bahrain]], [[Bhutan]], [[Cambodia]], [[China]] (excepting [[Hong Kong]] and [[Macao]]), [[Comoros]], [[Iran]], [[Israel]], [[Japan]], [[Kuwait]], [[Laos]], [[Libya]], [[Maldives]], [[Mauritania]], [[Mongolia]], [[Morocco]], [[North Korea]], [[Oman]], [[Pakistan]], [[Qatar]], [[Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic]], [[Saudi Arabia]], [[Somalia]], [[Tajikistan]], [[Thailand]], [[Tunisia]], [[Turkey]], [[Turkmenistan]], [[United Arab Emirates]], [[Uzbekistan]], [[Vietnam]], and [[Yemen]]. Christmas celebrations around the world can vary markedly in form, reflecting differing cultural and national traditions.

Among countries with a strong Christian tradition, a variety of Christmas celebrations have developed that incorporate regional and local cultures. For Christians, participating in a religious service plays an important part in the recognition of the season. Christmas, along with Easter, is the period of highest annual church attendance. In [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] countries, people hold religious processions or [[parade]]s in the days preceding Christmas. In other countries, secular processions or parades featuring Santa Claus and other seasonal figures are often held. Family reunions and the exchange of gifts are a widespread feature of the season. Gift giving takes place on Christmas Day in most countries. Others practice gift giving on December 6, Saint Nicholas Day, and January 6, [[Epiphany (holiday)|Epiphany]].

===Decorations===

The practice of putting up special decorations at Christmas has a long history. In the 15th century, it was recorded that in London it was the custom at Christmas for every house and all the parish churches to be &quot;decked with [[Quercus ilex|holm]], ivy, [[bay leaves|bays]], and whatsoever the season of the year afforded to be green&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Miles, Clement A, ''Christmas customs and traditions'', Courier Dover Publications, 1976, ISBN 0-486-23354-5, p. 272.&lt;/ref&gt; The heart-shaped leaves of [[ivy]] were said to symbolize the coming to earth of Jesus, while [[holly]] was seen as protection against pagans and witches, its thorns and red berries held to represent the [[Crown of Thorns]] worn by Jesus at the crucifixion and the blood he shed.&lt;ref&gt;Heller, Ruth, ''Christmas: Its Carols, Customs &amp; Legends'', Alfred Publishing (1985), ISBN 0-7692-4399-1, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Ace Collins&quot;&gt;{{cite book

Within some families, the pieces used to make the representation are considered a valuable family [[heirloom]].

The traditional colors of Christmas decorations are [[red]], [[green]], and [[gold (color)|gold]]. Red symbolizes the blood of Jesus, which was shed in his [[crucifixion]], while green symbolizes eternal life, and in particular the evergreen tree, which does not lose its leaves in the winter, and gold is the first color associated with Christmas, as one of the three gifts of the [[Magi]], symbolizing royalty.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ace Collins&quot;/&gt;
[[File:Advent Wreath (Broadway United Methodist Church).jpg|thumb|170px|right|On Christmas Day, the Christ Candle in the center of the [[Advent wreath]] is traditionally lit in many [[church service]]s.]]
The [[Christmas tree]] is considered by some as [[Christianisation]] of [[pagan]] tradition and ritual surrounding the [[Winter Solstice]], which included the use of [[evergreen]] boughs, and an adaptation of pagan [[tree worship]];&lt;ref name=Shaman/&gt; according to eighth-century biographer [[Æddi Stephanus]], [[Saint Boniface]] (634–709), who was a missionary in Germany, took an axe to an oak tree dedicated to [[Thor]] and pointed out a [[fir tree]], which he stated was a more fitting object of reverence because it pointed to [[Heaven (Christianity)|heaven]] and it had a triangular shape, which he said was symbolic of the [[Trinity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Fritz Allhoff, Scott C. Lowe|title=Christmas|publisher=[[John Wiley &amp; Sons]]|year=2010|quote=His biographer, Eddius Stephanus, relates that while Boniface was serving as a missionary near Geismar, Germany, he had enough of the locals' reverence for the old gods. Taking an axe to an oak tree dedicated to Norse god Thor, Boniface chopped the tree down and dared Thor to zap him for it. When nothing happened, Boniface pointed out a young fir tree amid the roots of the oak and explained how this tree was a more fitting object of reverence as it pointed towards the Christian heaven and its triangular shape was reminiscent of the Christian trinity.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[English language]] phrase &quot;Christmas tree&quot; is first recorded in 1835&lt;ref name=Harper&gt;Harper, Douglas, [http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=Christ Christ], ''Online Etymology Dictionary'', 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; and represents an importation from the [[German language]].

From Germany the custom was introduced to Britain, first via [[Queen Charlotte]], wife of [[George III]], and then more successfully by Prince Albert during the reign of [[Queen Victoria]]. By 1841 the Christmas tree had become even more widespread throughout Britain.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lejeune, Marie Claire p.550&quot;&gt;Lejeune, Marie Claire. ''Compendium of symbolic and ritual plants in Europe'', p.550. University of Michigan ISBN 90-77135-04-9&lt;/ref&gt; By the 1870s, people in the United States had adopted the custom of putting up a Christmas tree.&lt;ref name=&quot;Shoemaker&quot;&gt;Shoemaker, Alfred Lewis. (1959) ''Christmas in Pennsylvania: a folk-cultural study.'' Edition 40. pp. 52, 53. Stackpole Books 1999. ISBN 0-8117-0328-2.&lt;/ref&gt; Christmas trees may be decorated with [[Christmas lights (holiday decoration)|lights]] and [[Christmas ornaments|ornaments]].

Since the 19th century, the [[poinsettia]], a native plant from [[Mexico]], has been associated with Christmas. Other popular holiday plants include holly, [[mistletoe]], red [[amaryllis]], and [[Christmas cactus]]. Along with a Christmas tree, the interior of a home may be decorated with these plants, along with [[Garland (decoration)|garlands]] and [[evergreen]] foliage. The display of [[Christmas village]]s has also become a tradition in many homes during this season. The outside of houses may be decorated with lights and sometimes with illuminated [[Sled|sleighs]], [[snowmen]], and other Christmas figures.

Other traditional decorations include [[Bell (instrument)|bells]], [[candles]], [[candy canes]], [[Christmas stocking|stockings]], [[wreath]]s, and [[angels]]. Both the displaying of wreaths and candles in each window are a more traditional Christmas display. The concentric assortment of leaves, usually from an [[evergreen]], make up Christmas wreaths and are designed to prepare [[Christians]] for the Advent season. Candles in each window are meant to demonstrate the fact that Christians believe that Jesus Christ is the ultimate light of the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Christmas lights and banners may be hung along streets, music played from speakers, and Christmas trees placed in prominent places.&lt;ref&gt;Murray, Brian.

Rolls of brightly colored paper with secular or religious Christmas motifs are manufactured for the purpose of wrapping gifts. In some countries, Christmas decorations are traditionally taken down on [[Twelfth Night (holiday)|Twelfth Night]], the evening of January 5.

===Music and carols===
{{Main|Christmas music}}
[[File:Chant'tie d'Cantiques dé Noué Dézembre 2009 Jèrri a.jpg|thumb|Christmas carolers in [[Jersey]]]]
The earliest extant specifically Christmas hymns appear in 4th-century [[Rome]]. Latin hymns such as &quot;[[Veni redemptor gentium]]&quot;, written by [[Ambrose]], Archbishop of Milan, were austere statements of the theological doctrine of the Incarnation in opposition to [[Arianism]]. &quot;Corde natus ex Parentis&quot; (&quot;Of the Father's love begotten&quot;) by the Spanish poet [[Prudentius]] (d. 413) is still sung in some churches today.&lt;ref&gt;Miles, Clement, ''Christmas customs and traditions'', Courier Dover Publications, 1976, ISBN 0-486-23354-5, p.32&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 9th and 10th centuries, the Christmas &quot;Sequence&quot; or &quot;Prose&quot; was introduced in North European monasteries, developing under [[Bernard of Clairvaux]] into a sequence of rhymed [[stanza]]s. In the 12th century the Parisian monk Adam of St. Victor began to derive music from popular songs, introducing something closer to the traditional [[Christmas carol]].

By the 13th century, in France, Germany, and particularly, Italy, under the influence of [[Francis of Asissi]], a strong tradition of popular Christmas songs in the native language developed.&lt;ref&gt;Miles, pp. 31–37&lt;/ref&gt; Christmas carols in English first appear in a 1426 work of [[John Audelay|John Awdlay]], a [[Shropshire]] chaplain, who lists twenty-five &quot;caroles of Cristemas&quot;, probably sung by groups of [[Wassailing|wassailers]], who went from house to house.&lt;ref&gt;Miles, pp. 47–48&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Steaua, Bucharest, 1842 crop.jpg|thumb|left|Child singers in [[Bucharest]], 1841]]
The songs we know specifically as carols were originally communal folk songs sung during celebrations such as &quot;harvest tide&quot; as well as Christmas. It was only later that carols began to be sung in church. Traditionally, carols have often been based on [[medieval]] chord patterns, and it is this that gives them their uniquely characteristic musical sound. Some carols like &quot;[[Personent hodie]]&quot;, &quot;[[Good King Wenceslas]]&quot;, and &quot;[[The Holly and the Ivy]]&quot; can be traced directly back to the [[Middle Ages]]. They are among the oldest musical compositions still regularly sung. &quot;[[Adeste Fideles]]&quot; (O Come all ye faithful) appears in its current form in the mid-18th century, although the words may have originated in the 13th century.

Singing of carols initially suffered a decline in popularity after the [[Protestant Reformation]] in northern Europe, although some Reformers, like [[Martin Luther]], wrote carols and encouraged their use in worship. Carols largely survived in rural communities until the revival of interest in popular songs in the 19th century. The 18th-century English reformer [[Charles Wesley]] understood the importance of music to worship. In addition to setting many psalms to melodies, which were influential in the [[Great Awakening]] in the United States, he wrote texts for at least three Christmas carols. The best known was originally entitled &quot;Hark! How All the Welkin Rings&quot;, later renamed &quot;[[Hark! the Herald Angels Sing]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

[[Felix Mendelssohn]] wrote a melody adapted to fit Wesley's words. In Austria in 1818 Mohr and Gruber made a major addition to the genre when they composed &quot;[[Silent Night]]&quot; for the St. Nicholas Church, Oberndorf. [[William Sandys (antiquarian)|William Sandys]]' ''Christmas Carols Ancient and Modern'' (1833) contained the first appearance in print of many now-classic English carols, and contributed to the mid-Victorian revival of the festival.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Michael Kelly. A Christmas carol p.10. Broadview Press, 2003 ISBN 1-55111-476-3&lt;/ref&gt;

Completely secular Christmas seasonal songs emerged in the late 18th century. &quot;[[Deck the Halls]]&quot; dates from 1784, and the American &quot;[[Jingle Bells]]&quot; was copyrighted in 1857. In the 19th and 20th century, African American spirituals and songs about Christmas, based in their tradition of spirituals, became more widely known. An increasing number of seasonal holidays songs were commercially produced in the 20th century, including jazz and blues variations. In addition, there was a revival of interest in early music, from groups singing folk music, such as The Revels, to performers of early medieval and classical music.

===Traditional cuisine===
[[File:Christmas pudding.JPG|thumb|right|[[Christmas pudding]] cooked on [[Stir-up Sunday]], the Sunday before the beginning of the [[Advent]] season]]
A special [[Christmas dinner|Christmas family meal]] is traditionally an important part of the holiday's celebration, and the food that is served varies greatly from country to country. Some regions, such as [[Sicily]], have special meals for Christmas Eve, when 12 kinds of fish are served. In the United Kingdom and countries influenced by its traditions, a standard Christmas meal includes turkey, goose or other large bird, gravy, potatoes, vegetables, sometimes bread and cider. Special desserts are also prepared, such as [[Christmas pudding]], [[mince pie]]s, [[fruit cake]] and [[Yule log (cake)|Yule log cake]].&lt;ref&gt;Broomfield, Andrea (2007) [https://books.google.com/books?id=fJ_JDp9OgJEC&amp;pg=PA149&amp;dq=christmas+pudding+england&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=xzAVTc3WNoqWhQePsJW3Dg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CDQQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=christmas%20pudding%20england&amp;f=false Food and cooking in Victorian England: a history] pp.149–150. Greenwood Publishing Group, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Muir, Frank (1977) ''Christmas customs &amp; traditions'' p.58. Taplinger Pub. Co., 1977&lt;/ref&gt;

In Poland and other parts of eastern Europe and Scandinavia, fish often is used for the traditional main course, but richer meat such as lamb is increasingly served. In Sweden it is common with a special variety of [[smörgåsbord]], where ham, meatballs and herring play a prominent role. In Germany, France, and Austria, goose and pork are favored. Beef, ham, and chicken in various recipes are popular throughout the world. The [[Maltese people|Maltese]] traditionally serve ''[[Imbuljuta tal-Qastan]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://schoolnet.gov.mt/HelloEurope/activities/recepies/imbuljuta.html |title=Imbuljuta |publisher=Schoolnet.gov.mt |accessdate=February 3, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; a chocolate and chestnuts beverage, after [[Midnight Mass]] and throughout the Christmas season. Slovaks prepare the traditional Christmas bread [[potica]], ''[[bûche de Noël]]'' in France, ''[[panettone]]'' in Italy, and elaborate tarts and cakes. The eating of sweets and chocolates has become popular worldwide, and sweeter Christmas delicacies include the German ''[[stollen]]'', [[marzipan]] cake or candy, and Jamaican rum fruit cake. As one of the few fruits traditionally available to northern countries in winter, oranges have been long associated with special Christmas foods. [[Eggnog]] is a [[added sugar|sweetened]] [[dairy]]-based [[sweetened beverage|beverage]] traditionally made with milk and/or cream, sugar, and whipped eggs (which gives it a frothy texture). [[Distilled beverage|Spirits]] such as brandy, rum or bourbon are often added. The finished serving is often garnished with a sprinkling of ground cinnamon or nutmeg.

===Cards===

{{Main|Christmas card}}

Christmas cards are illustrated messages of greeting exchanged between friends and family members during the weeks preceding Christmas Day. The traditional greeting reads &quot;wishing you a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year&quot;, much like that of the first commercial [[Christmas card#History|Christmas card]], produced by [[Sir Henry Cole]] in London in 1843.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/1679110.stm Christmas card sold for record price] BBC News. Retrieved October 28, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; The custom of sending them has become popular among a wide cross-section of people with the emergence of the modern trend towards exchanging [[E-card]]s.

Christmas cards are purchased in considerable quantities, and feature artwork, commercially designed and relevant to the season. The content of the design might relate directly to the [[Nativity of Jesus|Christmas narrative]] with [[Nativity of Jesus in art|depictions of the Nativity of Jesus]], or [[Christian symbols]] such as the [[Star of Bethlehem]], or a white [[dove]] which can represent both the [[Holy Spirit]] and [[Peace]] on Earth. Other Christmas cards are more [[secular]] and can depict [[Christmas tradition]]s, mythical figures such as [[Santa Claus]], objects directly associated with Christmas such as candles, holly and baubles, or a variety of images associated with the season, such as Christmastide activities, snow scenes and the wildlife of the northern winter. There are even humorous cards and genres depicting nostalgic scenes of the past such as [[crinoline]]d shoppers in idealized 19th century streetscapes.

Some prefer cards with a poem, prayer, or [[Bible verse|Biblical verse]]; while others distance themselves from religion with an all-inclusive &quot;Season's greetings&quot;.

===Commemorative stamps===

A number of nations have issued [[commemorative stamp]]s at Christmastide. Postal customers will often use these stamps to mail [[Christmas card]]s, and they are popular with [[philately|philatelists]]. These stamps are regular [[postage stamps]], unlike [[Christmas seal]]s, and are valid for postage year-round. They usually go on sale some time between early October and early December, and are printed in considerable quantities.

In 1898 a Canadian stamp was issued to mark the inauguration of the Imperial Penny Postage rate. The stamp features a map of the globe and bears an inscription &quot;XMAS 1898&quot; at the bottom. In 1937, Austria issued two &quot;Christmas greeting stamps&quot; featuring a [[rose]] and the signs of the [[zodiac]]. In 1939, [[Brazil]] issued four [[semi-postal]] stamps with designs featuring the [[three kings]] and a [[star of Bethlehem]], an [[angel]] and child, the [[Southern Cross]] and a child, and a mother and child.

Both the [[US Postal Service]] and the United Kingdom's [[Royal Mail]] regularly issue Christmas-themed stamps each year.

After the introduction of the Julian calendar in Rome, the 25th of December became the day of ''Sol invictus'' when people greeted the winter solstice. It was the day of the Sun's rebirth, and it was the day of the Christmas festivities - although it was only in the year 336 AD that it appears to have become established as the day of Jesus's birth (see Pannenberg 1989: 57). The Eastern Church adopted this date even later, towards the end of the 4th century, having previously regarded the 6th of January as the day of gift-giving, as it still is in the Italian community of Befana. The winter solstice was a time of festivity in every traditional culture, and the Christian Christmas probably took its place within this mythical context of the solar cult. Its core dogma of the Incarnation, however, solidly established the giving and receiving of gifts as the structural principle of that recurrent yet unique event. 'Children were given presents as the Jesus child received gifts from the magi or kings who came from afar to adore him. But in reality it was they, together with all their fellow men, who received the gift of God through man's renewed participation in the divine life' (ibid.: 61).}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Sinterklaas 2007.jpg|thumb|[[Sinterklaas]] or [[Saint Nicholas]], considered by many to be the original Santa Claus]]
A number of figures are associated with Christmas and the seasonal giving of gifts. Among these are [[Father Christmas]], also known as [[Santa Claus]] (derived from the [[Dutch language|Dutch]] for Saint Nicholas), Père Noël, and the [[Weihnachtsmann]]; [[Saint Nicholas]] or [[Sinterklaas]]; the [[Christkind]]; Kris Kringle; [[Joulupukki]]; [[tomte]]; Babbo Natale; [[Basil of Caesarea|Saint Basil]]; and [[Ded Moroz]]. The Scandinavian tomte is sometimes depicted as a [[gnome]] instead of Santa Claus.

The best known of these figures today is red-dressed Santa Claus, of diverse origins. The name Santa Claus can be traced back to the Dutch ''Sinterklaas'', which means simply Saint Nicholas. Nicholas was a 4th-century [[Greeks in Turkey#History|Greek]] [[bishop]] of [[Myra]], a city in the [[Roman province]] of [[Lycia]], whose ruins are {{convert|3|km}} from modern [[Demre]] in southwest Turkey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author= Domenico, Roy Palmer |title= The regions of Italy: a reference guide to history and culture |publisher= Greenwood Publishing Group |year= 2002 |page=21 |isbn= 0-313-30733-4 |quote= Saint Nicholas (Bishop of Myra) replaced Sabino as the patron saint of the city...

As a port on the Mediterranean Sea, in the middle of the sea lanes that linked Egypt, Greece and Rome, Myra was a destination for traders, fishermen, and merchant sailors. Spawned by the spirit of both the city's Greek heritage and the ruling Roman government, cultural endeavours such as art, drama, and music were mainstays of everyday life. }}&lt;/ref&gt; Among other saintly attributes, he was noted for the care of children, generosity, and the giving of gifts. His feast day, December 6, came to be celebrated in many countries with the giving of gifts.&lt;ref name=ADS&gt;Forbes, Bruce David, ''Christmas: a candid history'', University of California Press, 2007, ISBN 0-520-25104-0, pp. 68–79.&lt;/ref&gt;

Saint Nicholas traditionally appeared in bishop's attire, accompanied by helpers, inquiring about the behaviour of children during the past year before deciding whether they deserved a gift or not. By the 13th century, Saint Nicholas was well known in the Netherlands, and the practice of gift-giving in his name spread to other parts of central and southern Europe. At the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] in 16th–17th-century Europe, many Protestants changed the gift bringer to the Christ Child or ''Christkindl'', corrupted in English to Kris Kringle, and the date of giving gifts changed from December 6 to Christmas Eve.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADS&quot;/&gt;

The modern popular image of Santa Claus, however, was created in the United States, and in particular in New York. The transformation was accomplished with the aid of notable contributors including [[Washington Irving]] and the [[German American|German-American]] cartoonist [[Thomas Nast]] (1840–1902). Following the [[American Revolutionary War]], some of the inhabitants of New York City sought out symbols of the city's non-English past. New York had originally been established as the Dutch colonial town of [[New Amsterdam]] and the Dutch Sinterklaas tradition was reinvented as Saint Nicholas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In 1809, the [[New-York Historical Society]] convened and retroactively named ''Sancte Claus'' the patron saint of [[New Amsterdam|Nieuw Amsterdam]], the [[Dutch language|Dutch]] name for [[New York City]].&lt;ref&gt;John Steele Gordon, ''[[The Great Game: The Emergence of Wall Street as a World Power: 1653–2000]]'' (Scribner) 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; At his first American appearance in 1810, Santa Claus was drawn in bishops' robes. However, as new artists took over, Santa Claus developed more secular attire.&lt;ref&gt;Forbes, Bruce David, ''Christmas: a candid history'', pp. 80–81.&lt;/ref&gt; Nast drew a new image of &quot;Santa Claus&quot; annually, beginning in 1863. By the 1880s, Nast's Santa had evolved into the modern vision of the figure, perhaps based on the English figure of Father Christmas. The image was standardized by advertisers in the 1920s&lt;ref name=&quot;Mikkelson&quot;&gt;Mikkelson, Barbara and David P., [http://www.snopes.com/cokelore/santa.asp &quot;The Claus That Refreshes&quot;], Snopes.com, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; and continues through the present day.&lt;ref name=tws2NovV111&gt;{{cite news

Father Christmas, a jolly, well nourished, bearded man who typified the spirit of good cheer at Christmas, predates the Santa Claus character. He is first recorded in early 17th century England, but was associated with holiday merrymaking and [[drunkenness]] rather than the bringing of gifts.&lt;ref name=Harper/&gt; In [[Victorian Britain]], his image was remade to match that of Santa. The French [[Père Noël]] evolved along similar lines, eventually adopting the Santa image. In Italy, Babbo Natale acts as Santa Claus, while [[La Befana]] is the bringer of gifts and arrives on the eve of the [[Epiphany (Christian)|Epiphany]]. It is said that La Befana set out to bring the baby Jesus gifts, but got lost along the way. Now, she brings gifts to all children. In some cultures Santa Claus is accompanied by [[Knecht Ruprecht]], or [[Zwarte Piet|Black Peter]]. In other versions, [[elf|elves]] make the toys. His wife is referred to as [[Mrs. Claus]].

There has been some opposition to the narrative of the American evolution of Saint Nicholas into the modern Santa. It has been claimed that the Saint Nicholas Society was not founded until 1835, almost half a century after the end of the American War of Independence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Current tradition in several [[Latin American]] countries (such as [[Venezuela]] and [[Colombia]]) holds that while Santa makes the toys, he then gives them to the Baby Jesus, who is the one who actually delivers them to the children's homes, a reconciliation between traditional [[Religion|religious beliefs]] and the [[iconography]] of Santa Claus imported from the United States.

In [[South Tyrol]] (Italy), Austria, Czech Republic, Southern Germany, Hungary, [[Liechtenstein]], [[Slovakia]], and Switzerland, the [[Christkind]] ([[Ježíšek]] in Czech, Jézuska in Hungarian and Ježiško in Slovak) brings the presents. Greek children get their presents from [[Saint Basil]] on New Year's Eve, the eve of that saint's liturgical feast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.skiathosbooks.com/saints_basil.htm |title=St. Basil (330–379) |publisher=Skiathosbooks.com |accessdate=February 3, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The German St. Nikolaus is not identical with the Weihnachtsmann (who is the German version of Santa Claus / Father Christmas). St. Nikolaus wears a [[bishop]]'s dress and still brings small gifts (usually candies, nuts, and fruits) on December 6 and is accompanied by [[Knecht Ruprecht]]. Although many parents around the world routinely teach their children about Santa Claus and other gift bringers, some have come to reject this practice, considering it deceptive.&lt;ref&gt;Matera, Mariane.

The [[New Testament]] [[Gospel of Luke]] may indirectly give the date as December for the birth of Jesus, with the sixth month of Elizabeth's pregnancy with [[John the Baptist]] cited by [[John Chrysostom]] (c. 386) as a date for the [[Annunciation]].&lt;ref name=&quot;CathChrit&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;bib-arch.org&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Gibson&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9082431/Christmas Christmas], ''Encyclopædia Britannica'' Chicago: Encyclopædia Britannica, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tertullian]] (d. 220) did not mention Christmas as a major [[Calendar of saints|feast day]] in the [[African Rite|Church of Roman Africa]].&lt;ref name=&quot;CathChrit&quot;/&gt; In ''Chronographai'', a reference work published in 221, [[Sextus Julius Africanus]] suggested that Jesus was conceived on the [[spring equinox]].&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9082431/Christmas Christmas]&quot;, ''Encyclopædia Britannica'' Chicago: Encyclopædia Britannica, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Roll, p. 79, 80.

The belief that [[God the Son|God]] came into the world in the [[Incarnation (Christianity)|form of man]] to [[Atonement in Christianity|atone]] for the [[sin]]s of humanity, rather than the exact birth date, is considered to be the primary purpose in celebrating Christmas.&lt;ref name=&quot;Joan Chittister, Phyllis Tickle&quot;&gt;{{cite book|url = https://books.google.com/?id=inhMGc5732kC&amp;pg=PT40&amp;dq=date+of+christmas+important#v=onepage&amp;q=date%20of%20christmas%20important&amp;f=false| title = The Liturgical Year|publisher = [[Thomas Nelson (publisher)|Thomas Nelson]]|quote=Christmas is not really about the celebration of a birth date at all.

The best estimate is that Jesus was probably born in the springtime, somewhere between the years of 6 and 4 BC, as December is in the middle of the cold rainy season in [[Bethlehem]], when the sheep are kept inside and not on pasture as told in the Bible. The lack of a consistent system of timekeeping in the first century, mistakes in later calendars and calculations, and lack of historical details to cross reference events has led to this imprecision in fixing Jesus' birth.

In the early 4th century, the church calendar in Rome contained Christmas on December 25 and other holidays placed on solar dates.

(Note that the first edition, 1889, doesn't have the discussion of Natalis Solis Invicti); also ''Sol Invictus'' (1905).)&lt;/ref&gt; and others&lt;ref name=&quot;Christmas&quot;/&gt; proposed that the Christians chose this day because it was the Roman feast celebrating the birthday of Sol Invictus.  Modern scholar S. E. Hijmans, however, states that &quot;While they were aware that pagans called this day the 'birthday' of Sol Invictus, this did not concern them and it did not play any role in their choice of date for Christmas.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Hijmans&quot; /&gt;

Around the year 386 [[John Chrysostom]] delivered a sermon in [[Antioch]] in favour of adopting December 25 celebration also in the East, since, he said, the conception of Jesus ({{bibleverse||Luke|1:26|31}}) had been announced during the sixth month of Elisabeth's pregnancy with John the Baptist ({{bibleverse||Luke|1:10–13|31}}), which he dated from the duties Zacharias performed on the [[Day of Atonement]] during the seventh month of the [[Hebrew calendar]] Ethanim or Tishri ({{bibleverse||Leviticus|16:29|31}}, {{bibleverse|1|Kings|8:2|31}}) which falls from late September to early October.&lt;ref name=&quot;CathChrit&quot;/&gt; That shepherds watched the flocks by night in the fields in the winter time is supported by the phrase &quot;frost by night&quot; in {{bibleverse||Genesis|31:38–40|31}}.

In the early 18th century, some scholars proposed alternative explanations. [[Isaac Newton]] argued that the date of Christmas, celebrating the birth of him whom Christians consider to be the &quot;Sun of righteousness&quot; prophesied in {{bibleverse||Malachi|4:2|31}},&lt;ref name=&quot;Newton&quot;/&gt; was selected to correspond with the southern solstice, which the Romans called ''bruma'', celebrated on December 25.&lt;ref name=&quot;SolsticeDate&quot;&gt;&quot;[http://www.cs.utk.edu/~mclennan/BA/SF/WinSol.html Bruma]&quot;, ''Seasonal Festivals of the Greeks and Romans''&lt;br /&gt;[[Pliny the Elder]], [[Natural History (Pliny)|Natural History]], [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus:text:1999.02.0137&amp;query=head%3D%231117 18:59]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1743, German Protestant Paul Ernst Jablonski argued Christmas was placed on December 25 to correspond with the Roman solar holiday ''[[Dies Natalis Solis Invicti]]'' and was therefore a &quot;paganization&quot; that debased the true church.&lt;ref name=&quot;SolInvictus&quot;/&gt; It has been argued that, on the contrary, the Emperor [[Aurelian]], who in 274 instituted the holiday of the ''Dies Natalis Solis Invicti'', did so partly as an attempt to give a pagan significance to a date already important for Christians in Rome.&lt;ref name=&quot;Touchstone&quot;/&gt; In 1889, [[Louis Duchesne]] proposed that the date of Christmas was calculated as nine months after the [[Annunciation]], the traditional date of the conception of Jesus.&lt;ref name=&quot;Roll87&quot;&gt;Roll, pp. 88–90.&lt;br /&gt;Duchesne, Louis, ''Les Origines du Culte Chrétien,'' Paris, 1902, 262 ff.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;bib-arch.org&quot;/&gt;

===Using the Julian calendar===
Some jurisdictions of the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]], including those of [[Russian Orthodox Church|Russia]], [[Georgian Orthodox Church|Georgia]], [[Ukrainian Orthodox Church|Ukraine]], [[Macedonian Orthodox Church|Macedonia]], [[Montenegro]], [[Serbian Orthodox Church|Serbia]], and [[Greek Orthodox Church of Jerusalem|Jerusalem]], mark feasts using the older [[Julian calendar]]. As of {{currentyear}}, there is a difference of 13 days between the Julian calendar and the modern [[Gregorian calendar]], which is used internationally for most secular purposes. As a result, December 25 on the Julian calendar currently corresponds to January 7 on the calendar used by most governments and people in everyday life. Therefore, the aforementioned Orthodox Christians mark December 25 (and thus Christmas) on the day that is internationally considered to be January 7.

However, other Orthodox Christians, such as those belonging to the jurisdictions of [[Bulgarian Orthodox Church|Bulgaria]], [[Church of Greece|Greece]], [[Romanian Orthodox Church|Romania]], [[Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople|Constantinople]], [[Greek Orthodox Church of Antioch|Antioch]], [[Greek Orthodox Church of Alexandria|Alexandria]], [[Orthodox Autocephalous Church of Albania|Albania]], [[Church of Cyprus|Cyprus]], [[Finnish Orthodox Church|Finland]], and the [[Orthodox Church in America]], among others, began using the [[Revised Julian calendar]] in the early 20th century, which at present corresponds exactly to the Gregorian calendar.&lt;ref name=4Dates&gt;
{{cite web
|url=http://www.sacred-destinations.com/israel/bethlehem-christmas
|title=Christmas in Bethlehem}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, these Orthodox Christians mark December 25 (and thus Christmas) on the same day that is internationally considered to be December 25, and which is also the date of Christmas among Western Christians.

A further complication is added by the fact that the [[Armenian Apostolic Church]] continues the original ancient [[Eastern Christianity|Eastern Christian]] practice of celebrating the birth of Christ not as a separate holiday, but on the same day as the celebration of his baptism ([[Epiphany (holiday)#Oriental Orthodox|Theophany]]), which is on January 6. This is a public holiday in [[Armenia]], and it is held on the same day that is internationally considered to be January 6, because the Armenian Church in Armenia uses the Gregorian calendar.

However, there is also a small [[Armenian Patriarchate of Jerusalem]], which maintains the traditional Armenian custom of celebrating the birth of Christ on the same day as Theophany (January 6), but uses the ''Julian'' calendar for the determination of that date. As a result, this church celebrates &quot;Christmas&quot; (more properly called Theophany) on the day that is considered January 19 on the Gregorian calendar in use by the majority of the world.

In summary, there are four different dates used by different Christian groups to mark the birth of Christ, given in the table below.

In most Western nations, Christmas Day is the least active day of the year for business and commerce; almost all retail, commercial and institutional businesses are closed, and almost all industries cease activity (more than any other day of the year), whether laws require such or not. In [[England and Wales]], the [[Christmas Day (Trading) Act 2004]] prevents all large shops from trading on Christmas Day. [[Scotland]] is currently planning similar legislation. [[Film studio]]s release many high-budget movies during the holiday season (e.g. The Lord of the Rings film trilogy, Avatar), including Christmas films, [[fantasy]] movies or high-tone dramas with high production values to hopes of maximizing the chance of nominations for the [[Academy Awards]].

One [[economist]]'s analysis calculates that, despite increased overall spending, Christmas is a [[deadweight loss]] under orthodox [[microeconomic theory]], because of the effect of gift-giving. This loss is calculated as the difference between what the gift giver spent on the item and what the gift receiver would have paid for the item. It is estimated that in 2001, Christmas resulted in a $4 billion deadweight loss in the U.S. alone.&lt;ref name=&quot;Deadweight&quot;&gt;&quot;The Deadweight Loss of Christmas&quot;, ''American Economic Review'', December 1993, '''83''' (5)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;econ&quot;&gt;[http://www.economist.com/finance/displayStory.cfm?Story_ID=885748 &quot;Is Santa a deadweight loss?&quot;] ''The Economist'' December 20, 2001&lt;/ref&gt; Because of complicating factors, this analysis is sometimes used to discuss possible flaws in current microeconomic theory. Other deadweight losses include the effects of Christmas on the environment and the fact that material gifts are often perceived as [[white elephant]]s, imposing cost for upkeep and storage and contributing to clutter.&lt;ref&gt;Reuters.

==Controversies==

Christmas has at times been the subject of controversy and attacks from various sources. A Puritan-led controversy began during the [[English Interregnum]] (1649–1660), when England was ruled by a [[Puritan]] [[Parliament of England|Parliament]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

During this brief period, the Puritan-led English Parliament banned the celebration of Christmas entirely, considering it &quot;a [[popish]] festival with no biblical justification&quot;, and a time of wasteful and immoral behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

'''Costume''' is the distinctive style of dress of an individual or group that reflects their class, gender, profession, ethnicity, nationality, activity or epoch.

The term also was traditionally used to describe typical appropriate [[clothing]] for certain activities, such as [[Riding habit|riding costume]], [[Swimsuit|swimming costume]], [[dance costume]], and  [[Evening dress (disambiguation)|evening costume]].  Appropriate and acceptable costume is subject to changes in [[fashion]] and local cultural norms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title = The complete history of costume &amp; fashion : from ancient Egypt to the present day|last = Cosgrave|first = Bronwyn|publisher = Checkmark Books|year = 2000|isbn = 0-8160-4574-7|location = New York|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This general usage has gradually been replaced by the terms &quot;dress&quot;, &quot;attire&quot; or &quot;wear&quot; and usage of &quot;costume&quot; has become more limited to unusual or out-of-date clothing and to attire intended to evoke a change in identity, such as theatrical, Halloween, and mascot costumes.

Before the advent of ready-to-wear apparel, clothing was made by hand. When made for commercial sale it was made, as late as the beginning of the 20th century, by &quot;costumiers&quot;, often women who ran businesses that met the demand for complicated or intimate female costume, including [[Hatmaking|millinery]] and [[Corsetmaker|corsetry]].&lt;ref name=Bishop&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bishop|first1=Catherine|title=Minding her own Business - Colonial businesswomen in Sydney|date=2015|publisher=NewSouth Publishing|location=Sydney, NSW|pages=37–38|isbn=9781742234328}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Etymology ==

'''Costume''' comes from the same Italian word, inherited via French, which means fashion or custom.&lt;ref name=&quot;etymdict&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=costume | title=Costume | publisher=etymonline.com | accessdate=18 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[National costume]] or regional costume expresses local (or [[exile]]d) [[Identity (social science)|identity]] and emphasizes a culture's unique attributes. They are often a source of national pride.&lt;ref name=&quot;EncNatDress&quot;&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lazWAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA266&amp;lpg=PA266&amp;dq=national+costume+identity+pride&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=rHtRrL21WF&amp;sig=KoFXUw0YR32QU-llD9GG1rCzba4&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CDYQ6AEwCGoVChMIvN7Hnu_JyAIVwXE-Ch3NWAdr#v=onepage&amp;q=national%20costume%20identity%20pride&amp;f=false | title=Encyclopedia of National Dress: Traditional Clothing Around the World | publisher=ABC-CLIO | date=19 April 2013 | accessdate=17 October 2015 | author=Condra, Jill | pages=266}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples include the [[Scotland|Scottish]] [[kilt]] or [[Japan]]ese [[kimono]].

In [[Bhutan]] there is a traditional national dress prescribed for men and women, including the monarchy. These have been in vogue for thousands of years and have developed into a distinctive dress style. The dress worn by men is known as [[Gho]] which is a robe worn up to knee-length and is fastened at the waist by a band called the [[Kera (clothing)|Kera]]. The front part of the dress which is formed like a pouch, in olden days was used to hold baskets of food and short dagger, but now it is used to keep cell phone, purse and the [[betel nut]] called ''Doma''. The dress worn by women consist of three pieces known as [[Kira (Bhutan)|Kira]], [[Toego|Tego]] and [[Wonju]]. The long dress which extends up to the ankle is Kira. The jacket worn above this is Tego which is provided with Wonju, the inner jacket. However, while visiting the [[Dzong]] or monastery a long scarf or stoll, called [[Kabney]] is worn by men across the shoulder, in colours appropriate to their ranks. Women also wear scarfs or stolls called [[Rachus]], made of raw silk with embroidery, over their shoulder but not indicative of their rank.&lt;ref name=Council&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tourism.gov.bt/about-bhutan/bhutanese-dress|title=Bhutanese Dress|accessdate=17 October 2015|publisher=Tourism Council of Bhutan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Theatrical costume ==
{{Main|Stage clothes}}

&quot;Costume&quot; often refers to a particular style of clothing worn to portray the wearer as a [[Character (arts)|character]] or type of character at a social event in a [[theatre|theatrical]] [[performance]] on the [[Stagecraft|stage]] or in film or television. In combination with other aspects of stagecraft, theatrical costumes can help actors portray characters' and their contexts as well as communicate information about the historical period/era, geographic location and time of day, season or weather of the theatrical performance. Some stylized theatrical costumes, such as [[Harlequin]] and [[Trousers|Pantaloon]] in the [[Commedia dell'arte]], exaggerate an aspect of a character.

== Religious festivals ==
[[File:Oldfashioned.jpg|thumb|A traditional, European-style [[Santa suit]]]]
The wearing of costumes is an important part of [[holidays]] developed from religious [[festival]]s such as [[Mardi Gras]] (in the lead up to [[Easter]]), and Halloween (related to [[All Hallow's Eve]]). [[French Quarter Mardi Gras costumes|Mardi Gras costumes]] usually take the form of [[jester]]s and other fantasy characters; [[Halloween costume]]s traditionally take the form of [[supernatural]] creatures such as [[ghosts]], [[vampires]], pop-culture icons and [[angels]]. In modern times. Christmas costumes typically portray characters such as [[Santa Claus]] (developed from [[Saint Nicholas]]). In Australia, the United Kingdom and the United States the American version of a [[Santa suit]] and [[beard]] is popular; in the Netherlands, the costume of [[Zwarte Piet]] is customary. Easter costumes are associated with the [[Easter Bunny]] or other [[animal costume]]s.

In [[Judaism]], a common practice is to dress up on [[Purim]]. During this holiday, Jews celebrate the change of their destiny. They were delivered from being the victims of an evil decree against them and were instead allowed by the King to destroy their enemies. A quote from the [[Book of Esther]], which says: &quot;On the contrary&quot; ({{lang-he|ונהפוך הוא}}) is the reason that wearing a costume has become customary for this holiday.

Buddhist religious festivals in [[Tibet]], [[Bhutan]], Mongolia and [[Lhasa]] and [[Sikkim]] in India  perform the [[Cham dance]], which is a popular dance form utilising masks and costumes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pearlman&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=Tibetan Sacred Dance: a Journey into the Religious and Folk Traditions |first=Ellen |last=Pearlman |publisher=Inner Traditions / Bear &amp; Co |year=2002 |pages=21, 32, 180 |isbn=0-89281-918-9 |url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=JX-gKEJPszwC |accessdate=16 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Greenwood&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=The Greenwood Encyclopedia of World Folklore and Folklife: Southeast Asia and India, Central and East Asia, Middle East |volume=2 |first=William M. |last=Clements |publisher=Greenwood Press |year=2006 |isbn=0-313-32849-8 |pages=106–110 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=ZvrWAAAAMAAJ |accessdate=16 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Dance&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://dancehistorydevelopment.wordpress.com/2013/05/16/cham-dance-the-masked-ritual/|publisher=History and Development of Dance/ Brockport|title=Cham Dance: The Masked Ritual|date=16 May 2013|accessdate=18 October 2015|work=World Press.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Parades and processions ==
Parades and processions provide opportunities for people to dress up in historical or imaginative costumes. For example, in 1879 the artist [[Hans Makart]] designed costumes and scenery to celebrate the wedding anniversary of the Austro-Hungarian Emperor and Empress and led the people of Vienna in a costume parade that became a regular event until the mid-twentieth century. [[Uncle Sam]] costumes are worn on [[Independence Day (US)|Independence Day]] in the United States. The [[Lion dance|Lion Dance]], which is part of Chinese New Year celebrations, is performed in costume. Some costumes, such as the ones used in the [[Dragon dance|Dragon Dance]], need teams of people to create the required effect.

== Sporting events and parties ==
Public sporting events such as [[fun run]]s also provide opportunities for wearing costumes, as do private [[masquerade ball]]s and [[fancy dress party|fancy dress parties]].

=== Mascots ===
[[File:Steinbockzunft Taisersdorf.jpg|thumb|[[Capra (genus)|Ibex]] costumes]]
Costumes are popularly employed at sporting events, during which fans dress as their team's representative [[mascot]] to show their support. Businesses use mascot costumes to bring in people to their business either by placing their mascot in the street by their business or sending their mascot out to sporting events, festivals, national celebrations, fairs, and parades. Mascots appear at organizations wanting to raise awareness of their work. Children's Book authors create mascots from the main character to present at their book signings. Animal costumes that are visually very similar to mascot costumes are also popular among the members of the [[furry fandom]], where the costumes are referred to as [[fursuit]]s and match one's animal persona, or &quot;fursona&quot;.

=== Children ===
Costumes also serve as an avenue for children to explore and roleplay. For example, children may dress up like characters from history or fiction, like pirates, [[princesses]] or cowboys. They may also dress in uniforms use in common jobs, like nurses or police officers, or as zoo or farm animals. Overall, young boys tend to prefer costumes that reinforce stereotypical ideas of being male, and young girls tend to prefer costumes that reinforce stereotypical ideas of being female.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title = Rituals and Patterns in Children's Lives|publisher = Popular Press|year = 2005|isbn = 978-0-299-20830-1|location = |pages = 225|editor-last = Jackson|editor-first = Kathy Merlock}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cosplay ===
{{Main|Cosplay}}
Cosplay, a word of Japanese origin that's short for &quot;costume play&quot;, is a performance art in which participants wear costumes and accessories to represent a specific character or idea that is usually always identified with a unique name (as opposed to a generic word). These costume wearers often interact to create a subculture centered on role play, so they can be seen most often in play groups, or at a gathering or convention. A significant number of these costumes are homemade and unique, and depend on the character, idea, or object the costume wearer is attempting to imitate or represent. The costumes themselves are often artistically judged to how well they represent the subject or object that the costume wearer is attempting to contrive.

== Design ==
{{Main|Costume design}}
[[Costume design]] is the envisioning of clothing and the overall appearance of a character or performer. Costume may refer to the style of dress particular to a nation, a class, or a period. In many cases, it may contribute to the fullness of the artistic, visual world that is unique to a particular theatrical or cinematic production. The most basic designs are produced to denote status, provide protection or modesty, or provide visual interest to a character. Costumes may be for, but not limited to, theater, cinema, or musical performances. Costume design should not be confused with costume coordination, which merely involves altering existing clothing, although both processes are used to create stage clothes.

=== Organizations ===
The [[Costume Designers Guild]]'s international membership includes motion picture, television, and commercial [[costume designer]]s, assistant costume designers and costume illustrators, and totals over 750 members.

=== Publications ===
''The Costume Designer'' is a quarterly magazine devoted to the costume design industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://costumedesignersguild.com/magazine/ |title=Current Issue |journal=The Costume Designer |publisher=[[Costume Designers Guild]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Notable designers and awards ===
[[List of costume designers|Notable costume designers]] include recipients of the [[Academy Award for Best Costume Design]], [[Tony Award for Best Costume Design]], and [[Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Costume Design]]. [[Edith Head]] and [[Orry-Kelly]], both of whom were born late in 1897, were two of  Hollywood's most notable costume designers.

=== DIY and homemade costumes ===
In the 20th century, contemporary fabric stores offered commercial patterns that could be bought and used to make a costume from raw materials. Some companies also began producing catalogs with great numbers of patterns.

More recently, and particularly with the advent of the Internet, the [[Do it yourself|DIY movement]] has ushered in a new era of DIY costumes and pattern sharing. [[PopSugar|POPSUGAR]] is one such example, with several hundred designs readily available.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.popsugar.com/latest/DIY-costumes |publisher=PopSugar |title=DIY Costumes}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[YouTube]], [[Pinterest]], [[Mashable]] also feature many DIY costumes.

== Industry ==
Professional-grade costumes are typically designed and produced by artisan crafters, often specifically for a particular character or setting. Specialty shops may also include common costumes of this caliber.

Some high-end costumes may even be designed by the costume's wearer.

The costume industry includes vendors such the American company [[Spencer Gifts|Spirit Halloween]], which opens consumer-oriented stores seasonally for Halloween with pre-made costumes.

A '''film festival''' is an organized, extended presentation of [[film]]s in one or more [[movie theater|cinema]]s or screening venues, usually in a single city or region. Increasingly, film festivals show some films outdoors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://openaircinemas.wordpress.com|title=Open air cinemas|work=Open air cinemas}}&lt;/ref&gt; Films may be of recent date and, depending upon the festival's focus, can include international and domestic releases. Some festivals focus on a specific film-maker or genre (e.g., [[film noir]]) or subject matter (e.g., horror film festivals). A number of film festivals specialise in [[short film]]s of a defined maximum length. Film festivals are typically annual events. Some film historians do not consider Film Festivals as official releases of film, like [[Jerry Beck]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cartoonresearch.com/index.php/animated-movie-guide-1/|title=Animated Movie Guide 1 - Cartoon Research|work=cartoonresearch.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The best known film festivals are the [[Venice Film Festival]], the [[Cannes Film Festival]], the [[Toronto Film Festival]], [[Sundance Film Festival]], and the [[Berlin International Film Festival]], the latter being the largest film festival worldwide, based on attendance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/625395/Venice-Film-Festival |title=Venice Film Festival|publisher=Britannica.com |date= |accessdate=2012-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/206977/film-festival |title=film festival|publisher=Britannica.com |date= |accessdate=2012-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Venice Film Festival is the oldest major festival. The [[Melbourne International Film Festival]] is the largest film festival in the Southern Hemisphere and one of the oldest in the world. A 2013 study found 3,000 active films festivals worldwide—active defined as having held an event in the previous 24 months.&lt;ref&gt;[[2013 study on 10,000 film festivals]]&lt;/ref&gt; 2016 study shows '''Regina international film festival and awards (RIFFA)'''&lt;ref name=&quot;riffa.ca&quot;/&gt; the latest trend and promising event of western Canada ([[Regina, Saskatchewan]]) attract international film industries, students, enthusiast and fashionista to the prairies.&lt;ref name=&quot;riffa.ca&quot;&gt;http://www.riffa.ca&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://tourismregina.com/events/regina-international-film-festival-awards/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatchewan/red-carpet-out-for-inaugural-regina-film-festival-1.3254964&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Venice Film Festival]] in [[Italy]] began in 1932, and is the oldest film festival still running. [[Raindance Film Festival]] is the UK's largest celebration of independent film-making, and takes place in London in October.&lt;ref name=&quot;independent.co.uk&quot;&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/media/advertising/beales-best-in-show-raindance-film-festival-4creative-922378.html | work=The Independent | location=London | title=Beale's best in show: Raindance film festival (4Creative) | date=September 8, 2008 | accessdate=May 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Australia's first and longest running film festival is the [[Melbourne International Film Festival]] (1952), followed by the [[Sydney Film Festival]] (1954).  [[Edinburgh International Film Festival]] is the longest running festival.

North America's first and longest running short film festival is the [[Yorkton Film Festival]], established in 1947.&lt;ref name=&quot;Yorkton1&quot;&gt;http://www.goldensheafawards.com/files/File/history/5_internationalfestival.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Yorkton2&quot;&gt;http://www.goldensheafawards.com/files/File/history/6_firstinternational.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The first film festival in the United States was the [[Columbus International Film &amp; Video Festival]], also known as [[The Chris Awards]], held in 1953. According to the [[Film Arts Foundation]] in San Francisco, &quot;''The Chris Awards'' (is) one of the most prestigious documentary, educational, business and informational competitions in the U.S; (it is) the oldest of its kind in North America and celebrating its 54th year.&quot; It was followed four years later by the [[San Francisco International Film Festival]], held in March 1957, which emphasized feature-length dramatic films. The festival played a major role in introducing foreign films to American audiences. Films in the first year included [[Akira Kurosawa]]'s ''[[Throne of Blood]]'' and [[Satyajit Ray]]'s ''[[Pather Panchali (film)|Pather Panchali]]''.

Today, thousands of film festivals take place around the world—from high profile festivals such as [[Sundance Film Festival]] and [[Slamdance Film Festival]] ([[Park City, Utah]]), to horror festivals such as Terror Film Festival ([[Philadelphia]]), and the Park City Film Music Festival, the first U.S. film festival dedicated to honoring music in film.

Digital feature film distribution began in 2005, along with the world's first [[online film festival]],{{citation needed|date=July 2015}} the [[Green Cine]] Online Film Festival, sponsored by [[DivX]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greencine.com/static/filmfestival/onlinefilmfest.jsp |title=DivX Networks Presents Greencine Online Film Festival |publisher=Greencine.com |date= |accessdate=2011-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Film Funding competitions such as Writers and Filmmakers were introduced when the cost of production could be lowered significantly and internet technology allowed for the collaboration of film production.

== Festival administration ==

=== Business Model ===
Although there are notable for-profit festivals such as SXSW, most festivals operate on a nonprofit membership-based model, with a combination of ticket sales, membership fees, and corporate sponsorship constituting the majority of revenue. Unlike other arts nonprofits (performing arts, museums, etc.), film festivals typically receive few donations from the general public and are occasionally organized as nonprofit business associations instead of public charities. Film industry members often have significant curatorial input, and corporate sponsors are given opportunities to promote their brand to festival audiences in exchange for cash contributions. Private parties, often to raise investments for film projects, constitute significant &quot;fringe&quot; events. Larger festivals maintain year-round staffs often engaging in community and charitable projects outside festival season.

=== Entry fee ===
While entries from established filmmakers are usually considered pluses by the organizers, most festivals require new or relatively unknown filmmakers to pay an entry fee to have their works considered for screening. This is especially so in larger film festivals, such as the [[Cannes Film Festival]], [[Toronto International Film Festival]], [[Sundance Film Festival]], [[South by Southwest]], [[Montreal World Film Festival]], and even smaller &quot;boutique&quot; festivals such as the [[Miami International Film Festival]], [[British Urban Film Festival]] in London and [[Mumbai Women's International Film Festival]] in India.

On the other hand, some festivals—usually those accepting fewer films, and perhaps not attracting as many &quot;big names&quot; in their audiences as do [[Sundance Film Festival|Sundance]] and [[Telluride Film Festival|Telluride]]—require no entry fee. [[Rotterdam Film Festival]], [[Mumbai]] Film Festival, and many smaller film festivals in the United States (the [[Stony Brook Film Festival]] on [[Long Island, New York|Long Island]], the [[Northwest Filmmakers' Festival]], and the Sicilian Film Festival in [[Miami, Florida|Miami]]), are examples.
 
The [[Portland International Film Festival]] charges an entry fee, but waives it for filmmakers from the [[Northwestern United States]], and some others with regional focuses have similar approaches.

Several film festival submission portal websites exist to streamline filmmakers' entries into multiple festivals. They provide databases of festival calls for entry and offer filmmakers a convenient &quot;describe once, submit many&quot; service. Examples include [[Withoutabox]], [[Film Freeway]], [[Reelport]], [[FestHome]] and [[Film Festival Life]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Screening out of competition ===
The core tradition of film festivals is competition, that is, the consideration of films with the intention of judging which are most deserving of various forms of recognition. In contrast to those films, some festivals may screen (i.e., [[projector|project]] onto a [[Projection screen|movie screen]] before an audience) some films without treating them as part of the competition; the films are said to be &quot;screened out...&quot; (or &quot;outside...&quot;) &quot;of competition&quot;.

{{wikitionary|funeral}}

A '''funeral''' is a [[ceremony]] for honoring, respecting, sanctifying, or burieing the life of a person who has [[death|died]]. Funerary customs comprise the complex of beliefs and practices used by a [[culture]] to remember the dead, from interment itself, to various [[monuments]], [[prayers]], and [[rituals]] undertaken in their honor. Customs vary widely both between cultures and between [[Religion|religious]] groups and denominations within cultures. Common secular motivations for funerals include [[mourning]] the deceased, celebrating their life, and offering support and sympathy to the bereaved. Additionally, funerals often have religious aspects which are intended to help the soul of the deceased reach the [[afterlife]], [[resurrection]] or [[reincarnation]].

The funeral generally includes a ritual through which the corpse of the deceased is given up.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt; Depending on culture and religion, these can involve either the destruction of the body (for example, by [[cremation]] or [[sky burial]]) or its preservation (for example, by [[mummification]] or [[burial|interment]]). Differing beliefs about cleanliness and [[Mind–body problem|the relationship between body and soul]] mean that a funerary practice that is deeply sacred to one culture may be absolutely [[taboo]] in another. When a funerary ceremony is performed but the body of the deceased is not available, it is usually called a memorial service.

The word ''funeral'' comes from the Latin ''funus'', which had a variety of meanings, including the corpse and the funerary rites themselves. [[Funerary art]] is art produced in connection with burials, including many kinds of [[tomb]]s, and objects specially made for burial with a [[corpse]].

==Overview==
[[File:Peasant Funeral.jpg|thumb|''Peasant funeral in the [[Maumturks|Mam Turk mountains]] of [[Connemara]], [[Ireland]]'', 1870]]

Funeral rites are as old as human culture itself, pre-dating modern ''Homo sapiens'' and dated to at least 300,000 years ago.&lt;ref name=British&gt;
&quot;When Burial Begins&quot;, ''British Archaeology'', issue 66, August 2002, found at [http://www.britarch.ac.uk/BA/ba66/feat1.shtml British Archaeology website]. Accessed September 4, 2008.
&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in the [[Shanidar Cave]] in Iraq, in [[Bontnewydd Palaeolithic site|Pontnewydd Cave]] in Wales and at other sites across Europe and the Near East,&lt;ref name=British /&gt; archaeologists have discovered [[Neanderthal]] skeletons with a characteristic layer of [[flower]] [[pollen]]. This deliberate burial and reverence given to the dead has been interpreted as suggesting that Neanderthals had religious beliefs,&lt;ref name=British /&gt; although the evidence is not unequivocal – while the dead were apparently buried deliberately, burrowing rodents could have introduced the flowers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|first=J.

==Religious funerals==

===Bahá'í===
Funerals in the [[Bahá'í Faith]] are characterized by not embalming, a prohibition against cremation, using a chrysolite or hardwood casket, wrapping the body in silk or cotton, burial not farther than an hour (including flights) from the place of death, and placing a ring on the deceased's finger stating, &quot;I came forth from God, and return unto Him, detached from all save Him, holding fast to His Name, the Merciful, the Compassionate.&quot; The Bahá'í funeral service also contains the only prayer that's permitted to be read as a group - congregational prayer, although most of the prayer is read by one person in the gathering. The Bahá'í decedent often controls some aspects of the Bahá'í funeral service, since leaving a will and testament is a requirement for Bahá'ís. Since there is no Bahá'í clergy, services are usually conducted under the guise, or with the assistance of, a Local [[Spiritual Assembly]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Kitáb-i-Aqdas]], p. 65&lt;/ref&gt;

===Buddhist===
{{main|Funeral (Buddhism)}}
A Buddhist funeral marks  the transition from one life to the next for the deceased. It also reminds the living of their own mortality.

===Christian===
{{main|Christian burial|Cremation in the Christian World}}
Christian burials typically occur on consecrated ground.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.funeralpamphlets.com&lt;/ref&gt; For a time, burial was the preferred practice amongst Christians. This was because of the belief in the resurrection of the body. However, cremations are becoming more common, although some churches still forbid them. The Roman Catholic church prefers burial because of the its belief that burial shows greater dignity to the dead body: &quot;&quot;The Church earnestly recommends that the pious custom of burying the bodies of the deceased be observed; nevertheless, the Church does not prohibit cremation unless it was chosen for reasons contrary to Christian doctrine&quot; (canon 1176.3).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.usccb.org/prayer-and-worship/bereavement-and-funerals/|title = US Conference of Catholic Bishops|date = |accessdate = 7 September 2015|website = Bereavement and Funerals|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Congregations of varied denominations perform different ceremonies, but most involve offering prayers, scripture reading from the Bible, words of comfort (sermon, homily, or eulogy), and music.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Accompany Them with Singing: The Christian Funeral|last = Long|first = Thomas G.|publisher = Westminster John Knox Press|year = 2009|isbn = 9780664233198|location = Louisville, KY|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; One issue of concern as the 21st century began was with the use of secular music at Christian funerals, a custom generally forbidden by the Roman Catholic Church.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.usccb.org/prayer-and-worship/bereavement-and-funerals/music-at-funerals.cfm|title = US Conference of Catholic Bishops|date = United States Conference of Catholic Bishops|accessdate = 7 September 2015|website = Music at funerals|publisher = United States Conference of Catholic Bishops|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hindu===
{{main|Antyesti}}
[[Antyesti]] literally means &quot;last rites or last sacrifice&quot;, refers to the rite of passage rituals associated with a funeral in Hinduism.&lt;ref&gt;[http://spokensanskrit.de/index.php?script=HK&amp;beginning=0+&amp;tinput=funeral+&amp;trans=Translate&amp;direction=AU Antayesti] Cologne Sanskrit Digital Lexicon, Germany&lt;/ref&gt; It is sometimes referred to as ''Antima Samskaram'', ''Antya-kriya'', ''Anvarohanyya'', or ''Vahni Sanskara''.

A dead adult Hindu is mourned with a cremation, while a dead child is typically buried.&lt;ref name=olsonant/&gt;&lt;ref name=fowler&gt;J Fowler (1996), Hinduism: Beliefs and Practices, Sussex Academic Press, ISBN 978-1898723608, pages 59-60&lt;/ref&gt; The rite of passage is performed in harmony with the sacred premise that the microcosm of all living beings is a reflection of a macrocosm of the universe.&lt;ref name=terje&gt;Terje Oestigaard, in The Oxford Handbook of the Archaeology of Death and Burial (Editors: Sarah Tarlow, Liv Nilsson Stut), Oxford University Press, ISBN , pages 497-501&lt;/ref&gt; The soul (Atman, Brahman) is the essence and immortal that is released at the ''Antyeshti'' ritual, but both the body and the universe are vehicles and transitory in various schools of Hinduism. They consist of five elements - air, water, fire, earth and space.&lt;ref name=terje/&gt; The last rite of passage returns the body to the five elements and origins.&lt;ref name=olsonant&gt;Carl Olson (2007), The Many Colors of Hinduism: A Thematic-historical Introduction, Rutgers University Press, ISBN 978-0813540689, pages 99-100&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=terje/&gt; The roots of this belief are found in the Vedas, for example in the hymns of [[Rigveda]] in section 10.16, as follows,

[[File:Bagamati cremation.jpg|thumb|A Hindu cremation rite in [[Nepal]]. The samskara above shows the body wrapped in saffron red on a pyre.]]
{{Quote|
&lt;poem&gt;
Burn him not up, nor quite consume him, Agni: let not his body or his skin be scattered,
O all possessing Fire, when thou hast matured him, then send him on his way unto the Fathers.
When thou hast made him ready, all possessing Fire, then do thou give him over to the Fathers,
When he attains unto the life that waits him, he shall become subject to the will of gods.
The Sun receive thine eye, the Wind thy ''Prana'' (life-principle, breathe); go, as thy merit is, to earth or heaven.
Go, if it be thy lot, unto the waters; go, make thine home in plants with all thy members.

The final rites of a burial, in case of untimely death of a child, is rooted in Rig Veda's section 10.18, where the hymns mourn the death of the child, praying to deity Mrityu to &quot;neither harm our girls nor our boys&quot;, and pleads the earth to cover, protect the deceased child as a soft wool.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/rigvedasanhitc06wils#page/46/mode/2up Sukta XVIII - Rigveda], English Translation: HH Wilson (Translator), pages 46-49 with footnotes;&lt;br&gt;Wendy Doniger (1981), The Rig Veda, Penguin Classics, ISBN 978-0140449891, see chapter on Death&lt;/ref&gt;

Among Hindus, the dead body is usually cremated within a day of death. His or her dead body is washed, wrapped in white cloth if the dead is a man or a widow (red if her husband is still alive),&lt;ref name=fowler/&gt; the two toes tied together with a string, a ''Tilak'' (red mark) placed on the forehead.&lt;ref name=olsonant/&gt; The dead adult's body is carried to the cremation ground near a river or water, by family and friends, and placed on a pyre with feet facing south.&lt;ref name=fowler/&gt; The eldest son, or a male mourner, or a priest then bathes before leading the cremation ceremonial function.&lt;ref name=olsonant/&gt;&lt;ref name=carrie&gt;Carrie Mercier (1998), Hinduism for Today, Oxford University Press, ISBN 978-0199172542, page 58&lt;/ref&gt; He circumambulates the dry wood pyre with the body, says a eulogy or recites a hymn in some cases, places sesame seed in the dead person's mouth, sprinkles the body and the pyre with ghee (clarified butter), then draws three lines signifying ''Yama'' (deity of the dead), ''Kala'' (time, deity of cremation) and the dead.&lt;ref name=olsonant/&gt; The pyre is then set ablaze, while the mourner's mourn.

This day, in some communities, also marks a day when the poor and needy are offered food in memory of the dead.&lt;ref&gt;Colin Parkes et al (2015), Death and Bereavement Across Cultures, Routledge, ISBN 978-0415522366, page 66-67&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Algeria 1779 Antique Hand Col Print. Algerine Funeral.jpg|thumb|1779 [[Algeria]]n [[Salat al-Janazah|funerals]]]]
'''Funerals in [[Islam]]''' (called Janazah in Arabic) follow fairly specific [[rite]]s, though they are subject to regional interpretation and variation in custom. In all cases, however, [[sharia]] (Islamic [[religious law]]) calls for [[burial]] of the body, preceded by a simple [[ritual]] involving bathing and shrouding the body, followed by [[salat]] (prayer). [[Cremation]] of the body is forbidden.

Burial rituals should normally take place as soon as possible and include:
* Bathing the dead body,&lt;ref&gt;[[Sahih al-Bukhari]] 1254&lt;/ref&gt; except in extraordinary circumstances as in [[battle of Uhud]].&lt;ref&gt;Sahih al-Bukhari 1346&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Shroud|Enshrouding]] dead body in a white cotton or linen cloth.&lt;ref&gt;[[Sahih Muslim]] 943&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Salat al-Janazah|Funeral prayer]](صلاة الجنازة).
* Burial of the dead body in a grave.
* Positioning the deceased so that when his face or body is turned to right side it is faced towards [[Mecca]] (Makkah Al-Mukarramah).

===Jewish===
{{main|Bereavement in Judaism}}
In [[Judaism]], funerals follow fairly specific [[rite]]s, though they are subject to variation in custom. Funerals in Judaism share many features with those of Islam. Jewish religious laws such as ''[[halakha]]'' call for [[burial]] of the body, preceded by a basic [[ritual]] involving bathing and shrouding the body, accompanied by prayers and readings from the [[Torah]]. [[Cremation]] of the body is forbidden in [[Orthodox Judaism]], but allowed in [[Reform Judaism]].&lt;ref name=Jewish&gt;{{cite web|title=Jewish Funeral Traditions|url=https://www.everplans.com/tools-and-resources/jewish-funeral-traditions|publisher=Everplans|accessdate=17 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Burial rites should normally take place as soon as possible and include:
* Bathing the dead body.
* Enshrouding the dead body. Men are shrouded with a ''[[kittel]]'' and then (outside the [[Land of Israel]]) with a ''[[tallit]]'' (shawl), while women are shrouded in a plain white cloth.
* Keeping watch over the dead body.
* Burial of the dead body in a grave.&lt;ref name=Jewish /&gt;
* In many communities, the deceased is positioned so that the feet face the [[Temple Mount]] in [[Jerusalem]] (in anticipation that the deceased will be facing the reconstructed [[Third Temple]] when the [[messiah]] arrives and [[resurrection of the dead|resurrects the dead]]).&lt;ref name=davidson&gt;{{cite web|title=Are Bodies Buried in a Specific Direction?|url=http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/1672031/jewish/Are-Bodies-Buried-in-a-Specific-Direction.htm|accessdate=November 9, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sikh===
{{unreferenced section|date=February 2014}}
In Sikhism death is not considered a natural process, an event that has absolute certainty and only happens as a direct result of God's Will or Hukam. To a Sikh, birth and death are closely associated, because they are both part of the cycle of human life of &quot;coming and going&quot; ( ਆਵਣੁ ਜਾਣਾ, Aana Jaana) which is seen as transient stage towards Liberation ( ਮੋਖੁ ਦੁਆਰੁ, Mokh Du-aar), complete unity with God. Sikhs thus believe in reincarnation.

However, by contrast, the soul itself is not subject to the cycle of birth and death.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} Death is only the progression of the soul on its journey from God, through the created universe and back to God again. In life, a Sikh always tries to constantly remember death so that he or she may be sufficiently prayerful, detached and righteous to break the cycle of birth and death and return to God.

The public display of grief at the funeral or Antam Sanskar as it is called in the Sikh culture, such as wailing or crying out loud is discouraged and should be kept to a minimum. Cremation is the preferred method of disposal, although if this is not possible any other methods such as burial or submergence at sea are acceptable. Worship of the dead with gravestones, etc. is discouraged, because the body is considered to be only the shell and the person's soul is their real essence.

On the day of the cremation, the body is washed/bath and dressed and then taken to the Gurdwara or home where hymns (Shabads) from Sri Guru Granth Sahib Ji, the Sikh Scriptures are recited by the congregation, which induce feeling of consolation and courage. Kirtan may also be performed by Ragis while the relatives of the deceased recite &quot;Waheguru&quot; sitting near the coffin. This service normally takes from 30 to 60 minutes. At the conclusion of the service, an Ardas is said before the coffin is taken to the cremation site.

At the point of cremation, a few more Shabads may be sung and final speeches are made about the deceased person. The eldest son or a close relative generally starts the cremation process – light the fire or press the button for the burning to begin. This service usually lasts about 30 to 60 minutes.

The ashes are later collected and disposed by immersing them in the Punjab (five famous rivers in India). Sikhs do not erect monuments over the remains of the dead.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

The Sidaran Paath
The ceremony in which the Sidharan Paath is begun after the cremation ceremony, may be held when convenient, wherever the Guru Granth Sahib is present:

Hymns are sung from Sri Guru Granth Sahib Ji.
The first five and final verses of &quot;Anand Sahib,&quot; the &quot;Song of Bliss,&quot; are recited or sung.
The first five verses of Sikhism's morning prayer, &quot;Japji Sahib,&quot; are read aloud to begin the Sidharan paath.
A hukam, or random verse, is read from Sri Guru Granth Sahib Ji.
Ardas, a prayer, is offered.
Prashad, a sacred sweet, is distributed.
Langar, a meal, is served to guests.
While the Sidharan paath is being read, the family may also sing hymns daily. Reading may take as long as needed to complete the paath.

This ceremony is followed by Sahaj Paath Bhog, Kirtan Sohila, night time prayer is recited 1 week and finally Ardas called the &quot;Antim Ardas&quot; (&quot;Final Prayer&quot;) is offered the last week.

====Ancient Greece====
[[File:Gela Painter - Black-Figure &quot;Pinax&quot; (Plaque) - Walters 48225.jpg|thumb|The lying in state of a body ''(prothesis)'' attended by family members, with the women ritually tearing their hair ([[Attica|Attic]], latter 6th century BC)]]

{{Main|Ancient Greek funerals and burial}}
The Greek word for funeral – ''kēdeía'' (κηδεία) – derives from the verb ''kēdomai'' (κήδομαι), that means attend to, take care of someone. Derivative words are also ''kēdemón'' (κηδεμών, &quot;guardian&quot;) and ''kēdemonía'' (κηδεμονία, &quot;guardianship&quot;). From the Cycladic civilization in 3000BC until the Hypo-Mycenaean era in 1200–1100 BC the main practice of burial is interment. The cremation of the dead that appears around the 11th century BC constitutes a new practice of burial and is probably an influence from the East. Until the Christian era, when interment becomes again the only burial practice, both cremation and interment had been practiced depending on the area.&lt;ref&gt;Lemos 2002: Lemos I., The Protogeometric Aegean. The Archaeology of the Late Eleventh and Tenth Centuries BC, Oxford&lt;/ref&gt;

The ancient Greek funeral since the [[Homer]]ic era included the ''próthesis'' (πρόθεσις), the ''ekphorá'' (ἐκφορά), the burial and the ''perídeipnon'' (περίδειπνον). In most cases, this process is followed faithfully in Greece until today.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ims.forth.gr/joint_projects/e-mem/burial_customs-gr.htm#archaic IMS.forth.gr]&lt;/ref&gt;

''Próthesis'' is the deposition of the body of the deceased on the funereal bed and the threnody of his relatives. Today the body is placed in the casket, that is always open in Greek funerals. This part takes place in the house where the deceased had lived. An important part of the Greek tradition is the ''epicedium'', the mournful songs that are sung by the family of the deceased along with professional mourners (who are extinct in the modern era). The deceased was watched over by his beloved the entire night before the burial, an obligatory ritual in popular thought, which is maintained still.

''Ekphorá'' is the process of transport of the mortal remains of the deceased from his residence to the church, nowadays, and afterward to the place of burial. The procession in the ancient times, according to the law, should have passed silently through the streets of the city. Usually certain favourite objects of the deceased were placed in the coffin in order to &quot;go along with him.&quot; In certain regions, [[Charon's obol|coins to pay Charon]], who ferries the dead to the underworld, are also placed inside the casket. A last kiss is given to the beloved dead by the family before the coffin is closed.

[[File:2011 Enterrement de Jacquotte.jpg|thumb|left|Funeral with [[flowers]] on [[marble]]]]
The Roman orator [[Cicero]]{{citation needed|date=June 2012}} describes the habit of planting flowers around the tomb as an effort to guarantee the repose of the deceased and the purification of the ground, a custom that is maintained until today. After the ceremony, the mourners return to the house of the deceased for the ''perídeipnon'', the dinner after the burial. According to archaeological findings–traces of ash, bones of animals, shards of crockery, dishes and basins–the dinner during the classical era was also organized at the burial spot. Taking into consideration the written sources, however, the dinner could also be served in the houses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Ανώνυμος Πιστός και Απολογητής του Χριστού |url=http://www.apologitis.com/gr/ancient/tafi_ethima.htm |title=Apologitis.com |publisher=Apologitis.com |date= |accessdate=2013-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two days after the burial, a ceremony called “the thirds” would take place, while eight days after the burial, the relatives and the friends of the deceased assembled at the burial spot, where “the ninths” would take place, a custom that is maintained until today. In addition to this, in the modern era, memorial services take place 40 days, 3 months, 6 months, 9 months, 1 year after the death and from then on every year on the anniversary of the death. The relatives of the deceased, for an unspecified length of time that depends on them, are in mourning, during which women wear black clothes and men a black armband.

====Ancient Rome====
{{unreferenced section|date=February 2014}}
[[File:Sepolcro degli Scipioni 001 Entrata.jpg|thumb|Tomb of the [[Cornelia (gens)#Cornelii Scipiones|Scipios]], in use from the 3rd century BC to the 1st century AD]]
{{Main|Roman funerals and burial}}
In [[ancient Rome]], the eldest surviving male of the household, the ''pater familias'', was summoned to the death-bed, where he attempted to catch and inhale the last breath of the decedent.

Funerals of the socially prominent usually were undertaken by professional undertakers called ''libitinarii''. No direct description has been passed down of Roman funeral rites. These rites usually included a public procession to the tomb or pyre where the body was to be cremated. The most noteworthy thing about this procession was that the survivors bore masks bearing the images of the family's deceased ancestors. The right to carry the masks in public eventually was restricted to families prominent enough to have held ''curule magistracies''. Mimes, dancers, and musicians hired by the undertakers, as well as professional female mourners, took part in these processions. Less well-to-do Romans could join benevolent funerary societies (''collegia funeraticia'') that undertook these rites on their behalf.

Nine days after the disposal of the body, by burial or cremation, a [[Banquet|feast]] was given (''cena novendialis'') and a libation poured over the grave or the ashes. Since most Romans were cremated, the ashes typically were collected in an urn and placed in a niche in a collective tomb called a ''columbarium'' (literally, &quot;dovecote&quot;). During this nine-day period, the house was considered to be tainted, ''funesta'', and was hung with Taxus baccata or Mediterranean Cypress branches to warn passersby. At the end of the period, the house was swept out to symbolically purge it of the taint of death.

Several Roman holidays commemorated a family's dead ancestors, including the ''Parentalia'', held February 13 through 21, to honor the family's ancestors; and the [[Lemuralia|Feast of the Lemures]], held on May 9, 11, and 13, in which [[ghost]]s (''larvae'') were feared to be active, and the ''pater familias'' sought to appease them with offerings of beans.

The Romans prohibited cremation or inhumation within the sacred boundary of the city ''([[pomerium]])'', both from a sacred and civil consideration, so that the priests might not be contaminated by touching a dead body, and so that houses would not be endangered by funeral fires.

Restrictions on the length, ostentation, expense of, and behaviour during funerals and mourning gradually were enacted by a variety of law-givers. Often the pomp and length of rites could be politically or socially motivated to advertise or aggrandise a particular kin group in Roman society. This was seen as deleterious to society and conditions for grieving were set. For instance, under some laws, women were prohibited from loud wailing or lacerating their faces and limits were introduced for expenditure on tombs and burial clothes.

The Romans commonly built tombs for themselves during their lifetime. Hence these words frequently occur in ancient inscriptions, V.F. Vivus Facit, V.S.P. Vivus Sibi Posuit. The tombs of the rich usually were constructed of [[marble]], the ground enclosed with walls, and planted around with [[tree]]s. But common sepulchres usually were built below ground, and called [[hypogea]]. There were niches cut out of the walls, in which the urns were placed; these, from their resemblance to the niche of a pigeon-house, were called [[Columbarium|columbaria]].

Within the United States and Canada, in most cultural groups and regions, the funeral rituals can be divided into three parts:
visitation, funeral, and the burial service.
[[File:South Korea funeral motorcade.jpg|thumb|A western-style funeral motorcade for a member of a high-ranking military family in [[South Korea]].]]

====Visitation====&lt;!-- This section is linked from Coffin --&gt;
At the ''visitation'' (also called a &quot;[[Viewing (funeral)|viewing]]&quot;, &quot;[[Wake (ceremony)|wake]]&quot; or &quot;calling hours&quot;), in Christian or secular Western custom, the body of the deceased person (or decedent) is placed on display in the casket (also called a coffin, however almost all body containers are caskets). The viewing often takes place on one or two evenings before the funeral. In the past, it was common practice to place the casket in the decedent’s home or that of a relative for viewing. This practice continues in many areas of Ireland and Scotland. The body is traditionally dressed in the decedent's best clothes. In recent times there has been more variation in what the decedent is dressed in – some people choose to be dressed in clothing more reflective of how they dressed in life. The body will often be adorned with common jewelry, such as watches, necklaces, brooches, etc. The jewelry may be taken off and given to the family of the deceased or remain in the casket after burial. Jewelry will most likely be removed before cremation. The body may or may not be embalmed, depending upon such factors as the amount of time since the death has occurred, religious practices, or requirements of the place of burial.

The most commonly prescribed aspects of this gathering are that the attendees sign a book kept by the deceased's survivors to record who attended. In addition, a family may choose to display photographs taken of the deceased person during his/her life (often, formal portraits with other family members and candid pictures to show &quot;happy times&quot;), prized possessions and other items representing his/her hobbies and/or accomplishments. A more recent trend is to create a DVD with pictures and video of the deceased, accompanied by music, and play this DVD continuously during the visitation.

The viewing is either &quot;open casket&quot;, in which the embalmed body of the deceased has been clothed and treated with cosmetics for display; or &quot;closed casket&quot;, in which the coffin is closed. The coffin may be closed if the body was too badly damaged because of an accident or fire or other trauma, deformed from illness or if someone in the group is emotionally unable to cope with viewing the corpse. In cases such as these, a picture of the deceased, usually a formal photo, is placed atop the casket.

[[File:Tombstone of Yossele the Holy Miser.jpg|thumb|left|The tombstone of [[Yossele the Holy Miser]]. According to [[Jewish bereavement]] tradition, the dozens of stones on his tombstone mark respect for the Holy Miser.]]
However, this step is foreign to Judaism; Jewish funerals are held soon after death (preferably within a day or two, unless more time is needed for relatives to come), and the corpse is never displayed. As well, Torah law forbids embalming.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/282548/jewish/The-Basics.htm |title=Torah law forbids embalming |publisher=Chabad.org |date= |accessdate=2013-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Traditionally flowers (and music) are not sent to a grieving Jewish family as it is a reminder of the life that is now lost.(''See also [[Jewish bereavement]].'')

The decedent's closest friends and relatives who are unable to attend frequently send flowers to the viewing, with the exception of a Jewish funeral,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.whichfuneralplans.com/_webedit/uploaded-files/All%20Files/Jewish_Funeral_and_Mourning_Customs.pdf Jewish Funeral and Mourning Customs]&lt;/ref&gt; where flowers would not be appropriate (and donations are given to a charity instead).

[[Obituary|Obituaries]] sometimes contain a request that attendees omit flowers (e.g. &quot;In lieu of flowers&quot;). The use of these phrases has been on the rise for the past century. In the US in 1927, only 6% of the obituaries included the directive, with only 2.2% of those mentioned [[charitable organization|charitable contribution]]s as an alternative. By the middle of the century, they had grown to 14.5%, with over 54% of those noting a charitable contribution as the preferred method of expressing sympathy.&lt;ref&gt;A Centennial History of the AMERICAN FLORIST, a publication of Florists’ Review Enterprises, Inc., Frances Porterfield Dudley, Publisher, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; Today, well over 87% of them have such a note – but those statistics vary demographically.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}

The viewing typically takes place at a [[funeral home]], which is equipped with gathering rooms where the viewing can be conducted, although the viewing may also take place at a church. The viewing may end with a prayer service; in a Roman Catholic funeral, this may include a rosary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ascensionfuneralgroup.com/services/burial-services|title= Viewing before a funeral|date= |accessdate=2016-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In parts of Ireland and Scotland it is traditional to display the body of the deceased in the family home. This is called a wake and usually includes food, drink and sometimes music and singing.

A visitation is often held the evening before the day of the funeral. However, when the deceased person is elderly the visitation may be held immediately preceding the funeral. This allows elderly friends of the deceased a chance to view the body and attend the funeral in one trip, since it may be difficult for them to arrange travel; this step may also be taken if the deceased has few survivors or the survivors want a funeral with only a small number of guests.{{Citation needed|date=December 2015}}

====Funeral====
{{unreferenced section|date=February 2014}}
[[File:Flower-arrangement-funeral-white.jpg|thumb|Traditional flower arrangement for funeral ([[Denmark]])]]
A memorial service, often called a funeral, is often officiated by clergy from the decedent's, or bereaved's, church or religion. A funeral may take place at either a funeral home, church, or crematorium or cemetery chapel. A funeral is held according to the family's choosing, which may be a few days after the time of death, allowing family members to attend the service. This type of memorial service is most common for Christians, and Roman Catholics call it a mass when Eucharist (communion) is offered, the casket is closed and a priest says prayers and blessings. A Roman Catholic funeral must take place in a parish church (usually that of the deceased, or that of the family grave, or a parish to which the deceased had special links). Sometimes family members or friends of the dead will say something. If the funeral service takes place in the funeral home (mostly it takes place in the funeral home's chapel) it can be directed by a clergy (mostly for Protestant churches) or hosted by a very close family member most common a parent. In some traditions if this service takes place in a funeral home it is the same if it would take place in a church. These services if taking place in a funeral home consists of a lot of prayers, blessings and eulogies from the family.

The ''open-casket service'' (which is common in North America) allows mourners to have one last opportunity to view the deceased and say good-bye. There is an order of precedence when approaching the casket at this stage that usually starts with the immediate family (siblings, parents, spouse, children); followed by other mourners, after which the immediate family may file past again, so they are the last to view their loved one before the coffin is closed. This opportunity can take place immediately before the service begins, or at the very end of the service.&lt;ref&gt;Iserson 1994: 445.&lt;/ref&gt; A Roman Catholic funeral must be closed-casket, and relatives are expected to attend the few days before the service.

Open casket funerals and visitations are very rare in some countries, such as the United Kingdom and most European countries, where it is usual for only close relatives to actually see the deceased person and not uncommon for nobody to do so. The funeral service itself is almost invariably closed casket. Funeral homes are generally not used for funeral services, which are almost exclusively held in a church, cemetery, or crematorium chapel.

The deceased is usually transported from the funeral home to a church in a hearse, a specialized vehicle designed to carry casketed remains. The deceased is often transported in a procession (also called a funeral cortege), with the [[hearse]], funeral service vehicles, and private automobiles traveling in a procession to the church or other location where the services will be held. In a number of jurisdictions, special laws cover funeral processions – such as requiring other vehicles to give right-of-way to a funeral procession, excepting service vehicles and ambulances. Funeral service vehicles may be equipped with light bars and special flashers to increase their visibility on the roads. They may also all have their headlights on, to identify which vehicles are part of the cortege, although the practice also has roots in ancient Roman customs.&lt;ref&gt;Olmert, Michael (1996). ''Milton's Teeth and Ovid's Umbrella: Curiouser &amp; Curiouser Adventures in History'', p.34. Simon &amp; Schuster, New York. ISBN 0-684-80164-7.&lt;/ref&gt; After the funeral service, if the deceased is to be buried the funeral procession will proceed to a cemetery if not already there. If the deceased is to be cremated, the funeral procession may then proceed to the crematorium.

[[File:Beethoven Funerals.jpg|thumb|[[Death of Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]]'s funeral as depicted by [[Franz Xaver Stöber]].]]
Funeral services commonly include prayers, readings from a sacred text, hymns (sung either by the attendees or a hired vocalist) and words of comfort by the clergy. Frequently, a relative or close friend will be asked to give a [[eulogy]], which details happy memories and accomplishments; often commenting on the deceased's flaws, especially at length, is considered impolite. Sometimes the delivering of the eulogy is done by the clergy. Clergy are often asked to deliver eulogies for people they have never met. Church bells may also be tolled both before and after the service.

In some religious denominations, for example, [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]], [[Anglicanism|Anglican]] and the [[Churches of Christ]], eulogies from loved ones are somewhat discouraged during this service, in order to preserve respect for traditions. In such cases, the eulogy is only done by a member of the clergy. This tradition is giving way to eulogies read by family members or friends in a desire to ensure that it is done, &quot;just right.&quot; Also, for these same religions, the coffin is traditionally closed at the end of the wake and is not re-opened for the funeral service.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}

During the funeral and at the burial service, the casket may be covered with a large arrangement of flowers, called a casket spray. If the deceased served in a branch of the Armed forces, the casket may be covered with a national flag; however, in the US, nothing should cover the national flag according to Title 4, United States Code, Chapter 1, Paragraph 8i.

Funeral customs vary from country to country. In the United States, any type of noise other than quiet whispering or mourning is considered disrespectful.

A traditional Fire Department funeral consists of two raised aerial ladders.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} The firefighter(s) travel under the aerials on their ride, on the fire apparatus, to the cemetery. Once there, the grave service includes the playing of bagpipes. The pipes have come to be a distinguishing feature of a fallen hero's funeral. Also a &quot;Last Alarm Bell&quot; is rung. A portable fire department bell is tolled at the conclusion of the ceremony.

====Burial service====
{{unreferenced section|date=February 2014}}
[[File:Millais - Das Tal der Stille.jpg|right|thumb|[[John Everett Millais]] – The Vale of Rest]]

At a [[burial]] service, conducted at the side of the grave, [[tomb]], [[mausoleum]] or cremation, the body of the decedent is buried or cremated at the conclusion.

Sometimes, the burial service will immediately follow the funeral, in which case a [[funeral procession]] travels from the site of the memorial service to the burial site. In some other cases, the burial service is the funeral, in which case the procession might travel from the cemetery office to the gravesite. Other times, the burial service takes place at a later time, when the final resting place is ready, if the death occurred in the middle of winter. Celebration of Life services, which have grown in popularity with the steady increase in cremation over burial, may be held outside the funeral home or place of worship; restaurants, pubs and sporting facilities are popular choices based on the specific interests of the deceased.

If the decedent served in a branch of the Armed forces, [[military rites]] are often accorded at the burial service.

In many religious traditions, [[pallbearer]]s, usually males who are relatives or friends of the decedent, will carry the casket from the chapel (of a funeral home or church) to the hearse, and from the hearse to the site of the burial service. The pallbearers often sit in a special reserved section during the memorial service.

According to most religions, coffins are kept closed during the burial ceremony. In Eastern Orthodox funerals, the coffins are reopened just before burial to allow loved ones to look at the deceased one last time and give their final farewells. Greek funerals are an exception as the coffin is open during the whole procedure unless the state of the body does not allow it.

[[File:Medieval Royal Funeral007.jpg|thumb|[[Middle Ages|Medieval]] depiction of a royal burial service.]]
The morticians will typically ensure that all jewelry, including wristwatch, that were displayed at the wake are in the casket before it is buried or entombed. Custom requires that everything goes into the ground; however this is not true for Jewish services. Jewish tradition stipulates that nothing of value is buried with the deceased.

There is an exception, in the case of cremation. Such items tend to melt or suffer damage, so they are usually removed before the body goes into the furnace. Pacemakers are removed prior to cremation – if they were left in they could possibly explode and damage the crematorium.

===Private services===
{{unreferenced section|date=February 2014}}
On occasion, the family of the deceased may wish to have only a very small service, with just the deceased's closest family members and friends attending. This type of ceremony means it is closed to the public. One may only go to the funeral if one is invited. In this case, a private funeral service is conducted. Reasons vary but often include the following:
* The deceased was an [[infant]] (possibly, they may have been [[stillbirth|stillborn]]) or very aged, and therefore has few surviving family members or friends.
* The deceased may be a crime victim or a convicted criminal who was serving a prison sentence or executed. In this case, the service is made private either to avoid unwanted media coverage (especially with a crime victim); or to avoid unwanted intrusion (especially if the deceased was convicted of murder or sexual assault).
* The family does not feel able to endure a traditional service (due to emotional shock) or simply wants a quiet, simple funeral with only the most important people of the deceased's life in attendance.
* The family and/or the deceased, as more frequently preplanned, prefer simplicity and lower cost to that of traditional arrangements. The choice of cremation as an option to casketed burial is increasing and often includes disposition of the cremated remains at a time privately convenient to the deceased's family members.
* The deceased is of a distinct [[celebrity]] status, and holding public ceremony would result in too many guests who are not acquainted with the deceased to participate. On the other hand, if a [[state funeral]] is offered and accepted by the deceased's immediate family, a public funeral would ensue.

===Memorial services===
{{unreferenced section|date=February 2014}}
[[Image:BrochureMemorialSvcWilliamMcKinleyInsidePagesNashuaNH09191901.jpg|thumb|Order of exercises, local memorial service in Nashua, New Hampshire for U.S. President [[William McKinley]] on September 19, 1901, shortly after his assassination.]]

The memorial service is a service given for the deceased when the body is not present. The service takes place ''after'' [[cremation]] or [[burial at sea]], after donation of the body to an academic or research institution, or after the ashes have been scattered. It is also significant when the person is [[Declared death in absentia|missing and presumed dead]], or known to be deceased though the body is not recoverable. These services often take place at a funeral home; however, they can be held in a home, school, workplace, church or other location of some significance. A memorial service may include speeches ([[eulogy|eulogies]]), prayers, poems, or songs to commemorate the deceased. Pictures of the deceased and flowers are usually placed at the altar where the coffin would normally be placed.

After the sudden deaths of important public officials, public memorial services have been held by communities, including those without any specific connection to the deceased. For examples, community memorial services were held after the [[assassination of James A. Garfield]] and the [[assassination of William McKinley]].

In Poland, In urban areas, On the day of the funeral  people usually gather before the mass for a wake (czuwanie) by the casket (trumna) in a church or funeral home (zakład pogrzebowy). Family member will give their eulogies. Then there is a funeral mass or service at Cemetery chapel, Following the mass the casket is carried in Procession (usually by foot) on hearse to the Grave. Once at the Gravesite, the priest will commence the graveside committal service and the Casket is lowered. The Mass or Service usually takes place at the Cemetery.

===Funerals in Scotland===
An old funeral rite from the Scottish Highlands is to bury the deceased with a wooden plate resting on his chest. In the plate were placed a small amount of earth and salt, to represent the future of the deceased. The earth hinted that the body would decay and become one with the earth, while the salt represented the soul, which does not decay. This rite was known as &quot;earth laid upon a corpse&quot;. This practice was also carried out in Ireland, as well as in parts of England, particularly in Leicestershire, although in England the salt was intended to prevent air from distending the corpse.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=bmpMAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA262&amp;lpg=PA262 &quot;Salt&quot;], IN: ''The Table Book of Daily Recreation and Information; Concerning Remarkable Men, Manners, Times, Seasons, Solemnities, Merry-Makings, Antiquities and Novelties, Forming a Complete History of the Year'', ed.

===Other types of funerals===

====New Orleans jazz====
{{unreferenced section|date=February 2014}}
A unique funeral tradition in the United States occurs in New Orleans, Louisiana. The tradition arose from a combination of African spiritual practices, French musical traditions, and African-American cultural influences.

A typical [[jazz funeral]] begins with a march by the family, friends, and a jazz band, starting from the home, funeral home, or church, and proceeding to the cemetery. Throughout the march, the band plays very somber [[dirge]]s. Once the final ceremony has been completed, the march proceeds to a gathering place, and the solemn music is replaced by loud, upbeat, raucous music and dancing, where onlookers join in to celebrate the life of the deceased. Celebration of those who still have survived death, &quot;the butcher&quot;, ensues. This is the origin of the New Orleans dance known as the &quot;second line&quot; where celebrants do a dance-march, frequently while raising the hats and umbrellas brought along as protection from intense New Orleans weather and waving handkerchiefs above the head that are no longer being used to wipe away tears. Aspects of this tradition have been practiced in other locations by long-time devotees of jazz.

{{main|Natural burial}}
{{unreferenced section|date=February 2014}}
Those with concerns about the effects on the environment of traditional burial or cremation may choose to be buried in a fashion more suited to their beliefs. They may choose to be buried in an all natural bio-degradable green burial shroud, sometimes a simple coffin made of cardboard or other easily biodegradable material. Further, they may choose their final resting place to be in a park or woodland, known as an eco-cemetery, and may have a tree planted over their grave as a contribution to the environment and a remembrance.

====Humanist====
Non-religious funerals are legal within the [[UK]]. The [[British Humanist Association]] organises a network of [[humanist officiant|humanist funeral celebrants]] or officiants across [[England]] and [[Wales]],&lt;ref name=bha&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.humanism.org.uk/ceremonies/humanist-funerals-memorials |title=Humanist Funerals and Memorials |publisher=Humanism.org.uk |date= |accessdate=2013-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sussexfunerals.com/non-spiritual-choices-humanist-and-civil-funerals/ |title=Humanist funerals |publisher=IfIShouldDie.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2014-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a similar network is organised by the [[Humanist Society of Scotland]].

====Civil====
{{see also|Institute of Civil Funerals}}
Civil funerals are an alternative to religious or humanist ceremonies in the UK. Unlike a humanist funeral, a civil funeral can contain some religious content, such as hymns or reading if the family wish.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.iocf.org.uk/for-funeral-professionals-about-civil-funerals.html| title= About Civil Funerals| publisher = Institute of Funeral Celebrants | accessdate=2014-02-19| quote= Offered in England since April 2002, the Civil Funeral is a ceremony that reflects the beliefs and values of the deceased rather than those of the minister, officiant or Celebrant.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Police/fire services====
[[Image:Stairway2heaven.jpg|left|thumb|Traditional &quot;crossed-ladders&quot; for a [[fire department]] funeral]]
{{unreferenced section|date=February 2014}}
Funerals for fallen members of fire or police services are common in [[United States]] and [[Canada]]. These funerals involve honour guards from police forces and/or fire services from across the country and sometimes from overseas. The presence of outside members is regarded as a sign of respect and support from the brotherhood of fellow officers.{{Citation needed|date= January 2011}}

In the case of a fallen firefighter, the casket is often placed on top of a fire engine and draped with a flag. For both fire and police, a parade of officers often precedes or follows the hearse carrying the fallen comrade.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}

====Masonic====
A Masonic funeral is held at the request of a departed Brother or his family. The service may be held in a chapel, home, church, synagogue or Lodge room with committal at graveside, or the complete service can be performed at any of the aforementioned places without a separate, committal.

No one is ever obligated to have a Masonic Funeral. It is not a requirement of the Fraternity that a member have his funeral service conducted, either in whole or in part, by the Masonic Order. Any member who was in good standing at the time of his death may have a Masonic Funeral if he requested it or if his family so requests. Any participation in tire service, other than the attendance of individual Lodge members as a part of the general congregation, is always by request to the Fraternity.

There is no single Masonic funeral service. Some Grand Lodges (it is a world-wide organisation) have a prescribed service. Some of the customs involved may seem unusual to non-Masons. For example, the presiding officer may wear a hat while doing his part in the service, the Lodge members may place sprigs of evergreen on the casket, and a small white leather apron may be placed in or on the casket. The hat may be worn because it is Masonic custom (in some places in the world) for the presiding officer to have his head covered while officiating. To Masons the sprig of evergreen is a symbol of immortality. The white leather apron, called a &quot;lambskin,&quot; is the badge of a Mason and it is his to wear, even in death. He wore that apron when he was made a Mason, on the day he received his first degree.  Sometimes the wording of the Masonic Services is a bit old and archaic, and may reflect the thinking and values of an earlier day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Colon|first1=Felix|title=Masonic Funerals|url=http://www.millburnlodge127.com/masonicfunerals.html|publisher=THE MASONIC SERVICE ASSOCIATION|accessdate=5 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://grandlodgeofiowa.org/docs/ObituaryRites/MasonicMemorialHandbook.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==East Asian funerals==
{{unreferenced section|date=February 2014}}
{{see also|Chinese funerary art|Chinese veneration of the dead|Ancestor veneration in China|wu (shaman)|shi (personator)|joss paper|Culture of Vietnam#Funeral}}
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 137-009055, Leichenzug in Peking.jpg|thumb|left|Funeral procession in [[Beijing]], 1900]]
[[File:Korean Funeral Armband.png|thumb|A traditional armband indicating seniority and lineage in relation to the deceased, a common practice in South Korea.]]

In most East Asian, South Asian and many Southeast Asian cultures, the wearing of white is symbolic of death. In these societies, white or off-white robes are traditionally worn to symbolize that someone has died and can be seen worn among relatives of the deceased during a funeral ceremony. In Chinese culture, red is strictly forbidden as it is a traditionally symbolic color of happiness. Exceptions are sometimes made if the deceased has reached a high age, particularly between their mid-80s to age 100. In which case, the funeral is considered a celebration, where wearing white with some red is acceptable. Contemporary Western influence however has meant that dark-colored or black attire is now often also acceptable for mourners to wear (particularly for those outside the family). In such cases, mourners wearing dark colors at times may also wear a white or off-white armband or white robe.

In Southern China a traditional Chinese gift to the attendees upon entering is a white (and sometimes red) envelope, usually enclosing a small sum of money (in odd numbers, usually one dollar), a sweet, red thread, and a handkerchief, each with symbolic meaning. Chinese custom also dictates that the said sum of money should not be brought home. The sweet should be consumed the day of and anything given during the funeral must not be brought home. The exception is the red thread, which is tied to the front doorknob of the guest's house to ward off bad luck. The repetition of 3 is common where people at the funeral may brush their hair three times or spit three times before leaving the funeral to ward off bad luck. This custom is also found in other East Asian and Southeast Asian cultures however the custom the deceased's immediate family giving gifts and money to others involved in the funeral is not practiced in Northern China.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

Most Japanese funerals are conducted with Buddhist rites. Many feature a ritual that bestows a new name on the deceased; funerary names typically use obsolete or archaic kanji and words, to avoid the likelihood of the name being used in ordinary speech or writing. The new names are typically chosen by a Buddhist priest, after consulting the family of the deceased. Most Japanese are cremated.

Contemporary [[South Korean]] funerals typically mix western culture with traditional Korean culture, largely depending on socio-economic status, region, and religion. In almost all cases, all related males in the family wear woven arm bands representing seniority and lineage in relation to the deceased, and must grieve next to the deceased for a period of three days before burying the body. During this period of time, it is customary for the males in the family to personally greet all who come to show respect. While burials have been preferred historically, recent trends show a dramatic increase in cremations due to shortages of proper burial sites and difficulties in maintaining a traditional grave. The ashes of the cremated corpse are commonly stored in [[columbaria]].

===In Japan===
{{main|Japanese funeral}}
[[File:Sudangee (last offices) shaving the head of the dead in Japan-J. M. W. Silver.jpg|thumb|Sudangee or last offices being performed on a dead person, illustration from 1867]]
Religious thought among the Japanese people is generally a blend of Shintō and Buddhist beliefs. In modern practice, specific rites concerning an individual's passage through life are generally ascribed to one of these two faiths. Funerals and follow-up memorial services fall under the purview of Buddhist ritual, and 90% Japanese funerals are conducted in a Buddhist manner. Aside from the religious aspect, a Japanese funeral usually includes a wake, the cremation of the deceased, and inclusion within the family grave. Follow-up services are then performed by a Buddhist priest on specific anniversaries after death.

According to one estimate made in 2005, 99.82% of all deceased Japanese are cremated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.srgw.info/CremSoc5/Stats/Interntl/2005/StatsIF.html |title=Cremation Society of G.B. – International Cremation Statistics 2005 |publisher=Srgw.demon.co.uk |date=2007-02-06 |accessdate=26 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In most of these cases, the cremated remains are placed in an [[urn]] and then deposited in a family grave. In recent years however, alternative methods of burial have gained in popularity; such methods include scattering of the ashes, burial in outer space, and conversion of the cremated remains into a [[diamond]] that can be set in jewelry.

===In the Philippines===
{{main|Funeral practices and burial customs in the Philippines}}
Funeral practices and burial customs in the [[Philippines]] encompass a wide range of [[person]]al, [[Filipino culture|cultural]], and [[traditional]] beliefs and practices which [[Filipino people|Filipinos]] observe in relation to [[death]], [[bereavement]], and the proper [[honoring]], [[interment]], and remembrance of the dead. These practises have been vastly shaped by the variety of religions and cultures that entered the Philippines throughout its complex [[History of the Philippines|history]].

Most if not all present-day Filipinos, like their ancestors, believe in some form of an [[afterlife]] and give considerable attention to [[veneration of the dead|honouring the dead]].&lt;ref name=MC&gt;[http://musical-chemist.blogspot.com/2009/01/filipinos-and-funeral-traditions.html Filipinos and Funeral Traditions], Organ-ic Chemist, musical-chemist.blogspot.com, January 24, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Except amongst [[Islam in the Philippines|Filipino Muslims]] (who are obliged to bury a corpse less than 24 hours after death), a wake is generally held from three days to a week.&lt;ref name=Sandi&gt;Clark, Sandi.

==African funerals==

===West African===
African funerals are usually open to many visitors.
The custom of burying the dead in the floor of dwelling-houses has been to some degree prevalent on the [[Gold Coast (region)|Gold Coast]] of [[Africa]]. The ceremony is depends on the traditions of the tribe the deceased belonged to. The funeral may last for as much as a week. Another custom, a kind of memorial, frequently takes place seven years after the person's death. These funerals and especially the memorials may be extremely expensive for the family in question. Cattle, sheep, goats, and poultry, may be offered and then consumed.

[[Ashanti people|The Ashanti]] and [[Akan people|Akan]] ethnic groups in Ghana will typically wear red and black during funerals. For special family members, there is typically a funeral celebration with singing and dancing to honor the life of the deceased. Afterwards, the Akan hold a sombre funeral procession and burial with intense displays of sorrow. Other funerals in Ghana are held with the deceased put in elaborate &quot;fantasy coffins&quot; colored and shaped after a certain object, such as a fish, crab, boat, and even airplanes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.a-to-z-of-manners-and-etiquette.com/funeral-and-religious-customs.html |title=Funeral and Religious Customs |publisher=A-to-z-of-manners-and-etiquette.com |date=1936-01-10 |accessdate=2013-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Kane Kwei Carpentry Workshop]] in [[Teshie]], named after Seth Kane Kwei who invented this new style of coffin, has become an international reference for this form of art.

Some diseases, such as [[Ebola virus disease|Ebola]] can be spread by funerary customs including touching the dead. However, safe burials can be achieved by following simple procedures. For example, letting relatives see the face of the dead before bodybags are closed and taking photographs, if desired, can greatly reduce the risk of infection without impacting too heavily on the customs of burial.&lt;ref&gt;Accessed 2014 http://www.pbs.org/newshour/updates/bringing-safer-burial-rituals-ebola-countries/&lt;/ref&gt;

===East African===
{{unreferenced section|date=February 2014}}
In [[Kenya]] funerals are an expensive undertaking. Keeping bodies in morgues to allow for fund raising is a common occurrence more so in urban areas. Some families opt to bury their dead in the countryside homes instead of urban cemeteries, thus spending more money on transporting the dead.

==Mutes and professional mourners==
&lt;!-- This section is linked from redirect &quot;Mute (death customs)&quot; --&gt;
From about 1600 to 1914, there were two professions in Europe now almost totally forgotten. The mute is depicted in art quite frequently but in literature is probably best known from Dickens's ''[[Oliver Twist]]''. [[Oliver Twist (character)|Oliver]] is working for [[Mr. Sowerberry]] when this conversation takes place: &quot;There's an expression of melancholy in his face, my dear... which is very interesting. He would make a delightful mute, my love&quot;. And in ''[[Martin Chuzzlewit]]'', Moult, the undertaker, states, &quot;This promises to be one of the most impressive funerals,...no limitation of expense...I have orders to put on my whole establishment of mutes, and mutes come very dear, Mr Pecksniff.&quot; The main purpose of a funeral mute was to stand around at funerals with a sad, pathetic face. A symbolic protector of the deceased, the mute would usually stand near the door of the home or church. In Victorian times, mutes would wear somber clothing including black cloaks, top hats with trailing hatbands, and gloves.&lt;ref name=&quot;Puckle&quot;&gt;Bertram S. Puckle, ''Funeral Customs: Their Origin and Development'' (London: T. W. Laurie, ltd., 1926) p. 66.&lt;/ref&gt;

The professional mourner, generally a woman, would shriek and wail (often while clawing her face and tearing at her clothing), to encourage others to weep. These people are mentioned{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} in ancient Greek plays, and were commonly employed throughout Europe until the beginning of the nineteenth century. They continue to exist in Africa and the Middle East.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} The 2003 award-winning [[Philippines|Philippine]] comedy ''Crying Ladies'' revolves around the lives of three women who are part-time professional mourners for the Chinese-Filipino community in [[Binondo|Manila's Chinatown]]. According to the film, the Chinese use professional mourners to help expedite the entry of a deceased loved one's soul into heaven by giving the impression that he or she was a good and loving person, well loved by many.

==State funeral==
{{main|State funeral}}
Military and high-ranking political figures such as [[Horatio Nelson, 1st Viscount Nelson|Lord Nelson]], Sir [[Winston Churchill]], [[John F. Kennedy]], and [[Ronald Reagan]] were offered [[state funeral]]s.

==Final disposition==
{{refimprove section|date=February 2014}}
Some cultures place the dead in tombs of various sorts, either individually, or in specially designated tracts of land that house tombs. Burial in a [[graveyard]] is one common form of tomb. In some places, burials are impractical because the [[groundwater]] is too high; therefore tombs are placed above ground, as is the case in [[New Orleans, Louisiana]]. Elsewhere, a separate building for a tomb is usually reserved for the socially prominent and wealthy; grand, above-ground tombs are called [[mausoleum]]s. The socially prominent sometimes had the privilege of having their corpses stored in church crypts. In more recent times, however, this has often been forbidden by hygiene laws.
Burial was not always permanent. In some areas, burial grounds needed to be reused due to limited space. In these areas, once the dead have decomposed to skeletons, the bones are removed; after their removal they can be placed in an [[ossuary]].

===Burial at sea===
&quot;[[Burial at sea]]&quot; in past generations has meant the deliberate disposal of a corpse into the ocean, wrapped and tied with weights to make sure it sinks. It has been a common practice in navies and seafaring nations; in the [[Church of England]], special forms of funeral service were added to the [[Book of Common Prayer]] to cover it. In today's generation, &quot;burial at sea&quot; may also refer to the scattering of ashes in the ocean, while &quot;whole body burial at sea&quot; refers to the entire uncremated body being placed in the ocean at great depths.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} Laws vary by jurisdictions.

====Space burial====
[[Science fiction]] writers have frequently analogized with &quot;[[Space burial|burial in space]]&quot;.

===Cremation===
{{main|Cremation}}
{{unreferenced section|date=February 2014}}
Cremation is also an old custom; it was the usual mode of disposing of a corpse in [[ancient Rome]] (along with graves covered with heaped mounds, also found in [[Greece]], particularly at the Karameikos graveyard in Monastiraki). [[Vikings]] were occasionally cremated in their [[longship]]s, and afterwards the location of the site was marked with standing stones.

In recent years, despite the objections of some religious groups, cremation has become increasingly popular. Jewish law (''[[Halakha]]'') forbids cremation to [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox Jews]], believing that the soul of a cremated person will be unable to find its final repose. The [[Roman Catholic Church]] forbade it for many years, but since 1963 the church has allowed it, as long as it is not done to express disbelief in bodily [[resurrection]]. The church specifies that cremated remains are either buried or entombed; they do not allow cremated remains to be scattered or kept at home. Many Catholic cemeteries now have [[columbarium]] niches for cremated remains, or specific sections for those remains. Some denominations of [[Protestantism]] allow cremation, the more conservative denominations generally do not. The [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] and [[Islam]] also forbid cremation.&lt;ref&gt;What is Cremation, ''Cremation Association of North America.''&lt;/ref&gt; http://www.cremationassociation.org/?page=WhatIsCremation

Among Hindus, Jains, Sikhs and some sects of Buddhists such as those found in Japan, cremation is common.

===Feeding to scavenger animals===
{{unreferenced section|date=February 2014}}
{{see also|Sky burial}}
Rarer forms of disposal of the dead include exposure to the elements and to scavenger animals. This includes various forms of excarnation, where the corpse is stripped of the flesh, leaving only the bones, which are then either buried or stored elsewhere, in ossuaries or tombs for example. This was done by some groups of [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] in protohistoric times. Ritual exposure of the dead (without preservation of the bones) is practiced by [[Zoroastrian]]s in [[Bombay]] and [[Karachi]], where bodies are placed in &lt;!-- so-called --&gt;&quot;Towers of Silence&quot;, where [[vulture]]s and other carrion eating birds then dispose of the corpses. In the present-day structures, the bones are collected in a central pit where (assisted by lime) they, too, eventually decompose. Exposure to scavenger birds (with preservation of some, but not all bones) is also practiced by some [[Effects of high altitude on humans|high-altitude]] [[Tibetan Buddhism|Tibetan Buddhists]], where practical considerations (the lack of firewood and a shallow active layer) seem to have led to the practice known as ''jhator'' or &quot;giving alms to the birds&quot;.

===Mummification===
{{unreferenced section|date=February 2014}}
[[File:Takabuti.JPG|thumb|[[Takabuti]], an Egyptian mummy from the 7th century BC]]
Mummification is the drying of bodies to preserve them. The most famous practitioners were [[ancient Egypt]]ians&amp;mdash;many nobles and highly ranked bureaucrats had their corpses [[embalm]]ed and stored in luxurious [[sarcophagi]] inside their funeral mausoleums. [[Pharaoh]]s stored their embalmed corpses in [[Egyptian pyramids|pyramids]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

===Cannibalism===
Cannibalism has earlier been practiced post-mortem in parts of Papua New Guinea. The practice has been linked to the spread of a [[Prion#Prion disease|prion disease]] called [[Kuru (disease)|kuru]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merckmanuals.com/home/sec06/ch085/ch085e.html?qt=kuru&amp;alt=sh |title=Kuru: Prion Diseases: Merck Manual Home Edition |publisher=Merckmanuals.com |date= |accessdate=2013-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Promession===
[[Promession]] is a new method of disposing of the body. [[Patent]]ed by a [[List of companies of Sweden|Swedish company]], a promession is also known as an &quot;ecological funeral&quot;. Its main purpose is to return the body to soil quickly while minimizing pollution and resource consumption.

==Self-planned funerals==
Some people choose to make their funeral arrangements in advance so that at the time of their death, their wishes are known to their family. However, the extent to which decisions regarding the disposition of a decedent's remains (including funeral arrangements) can be controlled by the decedent while still alive vary from one jurisdiction to another. In the United States, there are states which allow one to make these decisions for oneself if desired, for example by appointing an agent to carry out one's wishes; in other states, the law allows the decedent's next-of-kin to make the final decisions about the funeral without taking the wishes of the decedent into account.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.qeepr.com/blog/who-has-the-right-to-make-decisions-about-your-funeral/ Who Has the Right to Make Decisions About Your Funeral?], www.qeepr.com, February 5, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

Many family members of a deceased person will regard any wishes the deceased had made known as carrying considerable [[moral authority]]. Some people may feel it is a person's right to have their wishes regarding their own body and the manner in which they are memorialized respected after death, while others may feel that funerals are rather for the benefit of the living than of the dead.

The decedent may, in most U.S. jurisdictions, provide instructions as to his funeral by means of a last will and testament. These instructions can be given some legal effect if bequests are made contingent on the heirs carrying them out, with alternative gifts if they are not followed. This assumes, of course, that the decedent has enough of an estate to make the heirs pause before doing something that will invoke the alternate bequest. To be effective, the will or other instrument stating the decedent's funeral wishes must be easily available, and some notion of what it provides must be known to the decedent's survivors: aspects of the disposition of the remains of President [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt]] ran contrary to a number of his stated wishes, which were found in a safe that was opened after the funeral.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.haddletonlaw.com/Articles/Funeral-Directions-In-Your-Will.shtml |title=Funeral Directions - In Your Will |publisher=Haddletonlaw.com |date= |accessdate=2013-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Anatomical gifts==
{{unreferenced section|date=February 2014}}
Another way of avoiding some of the rituals and costs of a traditional funeral is for the decedent to donate some or all of her or his body to a medical school or similar institution for the purpose of instruction in anatomy, or for similar purposes. Students of medicine and osteopathic medicine frequently study anatomy from donated cadavers; they are also useful in forensic research.

Making an anatomical gift is a separate transaction from being an organ donor, in which any useful organs are removed from the unembalmed cadaver for medical organ transplant. Under a Uniform Act in force in most jurisdictions of the United States, being an organ donor is a simple process that can often be accomplished when a driver's license is renewed.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}
There are some medical conditions, such as amputations, or various surgeries, that can make the cadaver unsuitable for these purposes. Conversely, the bodies of people who had certain medical conditions are useful for research into those conditions. All US medical schools rely on the generosity of &quot;anatomical donors&quot; for the teaching of anatomy. Typically the remains are cremated once the students have completed their anatomy classes, and many medical schools now hold a memorial service at that time as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Roach |first=Mary |title=Stiff: The Curious Lives Of Human Cadavers |url=http://www.amazon.co.uk/Stiff-Curious-Lives-Human-Cadavers/dp/0141007451 |publisher=Penguin |isbn=0141007451 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Fashion''' is a popular style or practice, especially in [[clothing]], [[footwear]], [[Fashion accessory|accessories]], [[makeup]], [[Human body|body]] or furniture. Fashion is a distinctive and often habitual trend in the style in which a person dresses. It is the prevailing styles in behaviour and the newest creations of textile designers.&lt;ref&gt;Fashion (2012, March 29). Wwd. (n.d.). Retrieved from http://www.wwd.com/fashion-news.&lt;/ref&gt; Because the more technical term ''costume'' is regularly linked to the term &quot;fashion&quot;, the use of the former has been relegated to special senses like [[Costume party|fancy dress]] or [[Masquerade ball|masquerade]] wear, while &quot;fashion&quot; generally means clothing, including the study of it.  Although aspects of fashion can be feminine or masculine, some trends are [[androgynous]].&lt;ref&gt;Undressing Cinema: Clothing and identity in the movies – Page 196, Stella Bruzzi – 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For a discussion of the use of the terms &quot;fashion&quot;, &quot;dress&quot;, &quot;clothing&quot;, and &quot;costume&quot; by professionals in various disciplines, see Valerie Cumming, ''Understanding Fashion History'', &quot;Introduction&quot;, Costume &amp; Fashion Press, 2004, ISBN 0-89676-253-X&lt;/ref&gt;

==Clothing fashions==
{{Main|History of Western fashion}}

Early Western travelers, whether to [[Iran|Persia]], [[Turkey]], [[India]],  [[China]], would frequently remark on the absence of change in fashion there. The Japanese [[Shogun]]'s secretary bragged (not completely accurately) to a Spanish visitor in 1609 that [[Japanese clothing]] had not changed in over a thousand years.&lt;ref&gt;Braudel, 312–13&lt;/ref&gt;  However, there is considerable evidence in [[Ming Dynasty|Ming China]] of rapidly changing fashions in [[Han Chinese clothing|Chinese clothing]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Timothy Brook (historian)|Timothy Brook]]: &quot;[[The Confusions of Pleasure: Commerce and Culture in Ming China]]&quot; (University of California Press 1999); this has a whole section on fashion.&lt;/ref&gt;  Changes in costume often took place at times of economic or social change, as occurred in [[ancient Rome]] and the medieval [[Caliphate]], followed by a long period without major changes. In 8th-century [[Moorish Spain]], the musician [[Ziryab]] introduced to [[Córdoba, Spain|Córdoba]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Salim al-Hassani|al-Hassani]], Woodcok and Saoud (2004), 'Muslim Heritage in Our World', FSTC publisinhg, pp. 38–9&lt;/ref&gt;{{Unreliable source?|Bias source per discussions at RS noticeboard|failed=y|date=March 2014}}&lt;ref&gt;Terrasse, H. (1958) 'Islam d'Espagne' une rencontre de l'Orient et de l'Occident&quot;, Librairie Plon, Paris, pp.52–53.&lt;/ref&gt; [[sophistication|sophisticate]]d clothing-styles based on seasonal and daily fashions from his native [[Baghdad]], modified by his own inspiration.  Similar changes in fashion occurred in the 11th century in the Middle East following the arrival of the [[Turkic peoples|Turks]], who introduced clothing styles from [[Central Asia]] and the [[Far East]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Medieval Islamic Civilization: A–K|author=Josef W. Meri &amp; Jere L. Bacharach|publisher=[[Taylor &amp; Francis]]|year=2006|isbn=0415966914|page=162}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The beginning in Europe of continual and increasingly rapid change in clothing styles can be fairly reliably dated.  Historians, including [[James Laver]] and [[Fernand Braudel]], date the start of Western fashion in clothing to the middle of the [[1300–1400 in fashion|14th century]].&lt;ref&gt;Laver, James: ''The Concise History of Costume and Fashion'', Abrams, 1979, p. 62&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;braudel&quot;&gt;Fernand Braudel, ''Civilization and Capitalism, 15th–18th Centuries, Vol 1: The Structures of Everyday Life,&quot; p317, William Collins &amp; Sons, London 1981&lt;/ref&gt;  The most dramatic early change in fashion was a sudden drastic shortening and tightening of the male over-garment from [[Calf (anatomy)|calf]]-length to barely covering the [[buttocks]],&lt;ref name=&quot;conceitom.com.br&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.conceitom.com.br/jeans/#more-1226|title=Jeans Calças Modelos Ideais|date=19 November 2014|work=Conceito M|accessdate=26 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; sometimes accompanied with stuffing in the chest to make it look bigger. This created the distinctive Western outline of a tailored top worn over leggings or trousers.

The pace of change accelerated considerably in the following century, and women and men's fashion, especially in the dressing and adorning of the hair, became equally complex. [[Art history|Art historians]] are therefore able to use fashion with confidence and precision to date images, often to within five years, particularly in the case of images from the 15th century. Initially, changes in fashion led to a fragmentation across the upper classes of Europe of what had previously been a very similar style of dressing and the subsequent development of distinctive national styles. These national styles remained very different until a counter-movement in the 17th to 18th centuries imposed similar styles once again, mostly originating from [[Ancien Régime]] [[France]].&lt;ref&gt;Braudel, 317–24&lt;/ref&gt; Though the rich usually led fashion, the increasing affluence of [[early modern Europe]] led to the [[bourgeoisie]] and even [[peasant]]s following trends at a distance, but still uncomfortably close for the elites – a factor that Fernand Braudel regards as one of the main motors of changing fashion.&lt;ref&gt;Braudel, 313–15&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:ADurerNuremburgVenetianWomen.jpg|thumb|[[Albrecht Dürer]]'s drawing contrasts a well turned out ''bourgeoise'' from [[Nuremberg]] (left) with her counterpart from [[Venice]]. The Venetian lady's high [[chopine]]s make her look taller.]]&lt;!-- This image is referenced in the article. Please don't remove.--&gt; In the 16th century, national differences were at their most pronounced.  Ten 16th century portraits of [[Germany|German]] or [[Italy|Italian]] gentlemen may show ten entirely different hats. [[Albrecht Dürer]] illustrated the differences in his actual (or composite) contrast of [[Nuremberg]] and [[Venice|Venetian]] fashions at the close of the 15th century (''illustration, right''). The &quot;Spanish style&quot; of the late 16th century began the move back to synchronicity among upper-class Europeans, and after a struggle in the mid-17th century, French styles decisively took over leadership, a process completed in the 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;Braudel, 317–21&lt;/ref&gt;

Though textile colors and patterns changed from year to year,&lt;ref&gt;Thornton, Peter. ''Baroque and Rococo Silks.''&lt;/ref&gt; the cut of a gentleman's coat and the length of his waistcoat, or the pattern to which a lady's dress was cut, changed more slowly. Men's fashions were largely derived from [[military]] models, and changes in a European male [[Silhouette]] were galvanized in theaters of European war where gentleman officers had opportunities to make notes of foreign styles such as the &quot;Steinkirk&quot; [[cravat]] or [[necktie]].
[[File:MA-Lebrun.jpg|thumb|left|[[Marie Antoinette]], wife of Louis XVI, was a leader of fashion. Her choices, such as this 1783 white [[muslin]] dress called a ''chemise a la Reine'', were highly influential and widely worn.&lt;ref name=dam&gt;{{cite book|last=Ribeiro|first=Aileen|title=Dress and Morality |year=2003 |publisher=Berg |isbn=9781859737828 |pages=116–117}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Though there had been distribution of dressed dolls from France since the 16th century and [[Abraham Bosse]] had produced engravings of fashion in the 1620s, the pace of change picked up in the 1780s with increased publication of French engravings illustrating the latest Paris styles. By 1800, all [[Western Europe]]ans were dressing alike (or thought they were); local variation became first a sign of provincial culture and later a badge of the conservative peasant.&lt;ref&gt;James Laver and Fernand Braudel, op cit&lt;/ref&gt;

Although tailors and dressmakers were no doubt responsible for many innovations, and the [[textile]] industry certainly led many trends, the [[history of fashion design]] is normally understood to date from 1858 when the English-born [[Charles Frederick Worth]] opened the first true ''[[haute couture]]'' house in Paris. The Haute house was the name established by government for the fashion houses that met the standards of industry.  These fashion houses have to adhere to standards such as keeping at least twenty employees engaged in making the clothes, showing two collections per year at fashion shows, and presenting a certain number of patterns to costumers.&lt;ref&gt;Claire B. Shaeffer (2001). [https://books.google.com/books?id=e3Sd_mikSP4C&amp;pg=PA7&amp;dq=charles+frederick+worth+haute+couture&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=mxbnS83pFJGB_QaU56WdCA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=8&amp;ved=0CFkQ6AEwBw#v=onepage&amp;q=charles%20frederick%20worth%20haute%20couture&amp;f=false Couture sewing techniques] &quot;Originating in mid- 19th-century Paris with the designs of an Englishman named Charles Frederick Worth, haute couture represents an archaic tradition of creating garments by hand with painstaking care and precision&quot;. Taunton Press, 2001&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, the idea of the [[fashion designer]] as a celebrity in his or her own right has become increasingly dominant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Parkins|first1=Ilya|title=Poiret, Dior and Schiaparelli: Fashion, Femininity and Modernity.|date=2013|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing |location=London |isbn=9780857853288|page=10|edition=English|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kT-Xcu-aWxQC&amp;pg=PA10|chapter=Introduction: Reputation, Celebrity and the &quot;Professional&quot; Designer}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea of unisex dressing originated in the 1960s when designers such as [[Pierre Cardin]] and [[Rudi Gernreich]] created garments, such as stretch jersey tunics or leggings, meant to be worn by both males and females. The impact of unisex expands more broadly to encompass various themes in fashion including androgyny, mass-market retail, and conceptual clothing.&lt;ref&gt;Park, Jennifer. &quot;Unisex Clothing.&quot; Encyclopedia of Clothing and Fashion.

Some men's styles blended the sensuality and expressiveness despite the conservative trend, the growing gay-rights movement and an emphasis on youth allowed for a new freedom to experiment with style, fabrics such as wool crepe, which had previously been associated with women's attire was used by designers when creating male clothing.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Clothing for Men.&quot; American Decades.

The four major current [[fashion capital]]s are acknowledged to be [[Paris]], [[Milan]], [[New York City]], and [[London]], which are all headquarters to the greatest fashion companies and are renowned for their major influence on global fashion. [[Fashion week]]s are held in these cities, where designers exhibit their new clothing collections to audiences.  A succession of major designers such as [[Coco Chanel]] and [[Yves Saint Laurent (designer)|Yves Saint-Laurent]] have kept Paris as the center most watched by the rest of the world, although ''haute couture'' is now subsidized by the sale of [[ready-to-wear]] collections and [[perfume]] using the same [[brand]]ing.

Modern [[Western culture|West]]erners have a wide number of choices available in the selection of their clothes. What a person chooses to wear can reflect his or her [[Wiktionary:personality|personality]] or interests. When people who have high cultural [[Social status|status]] start to wear new or different clothes, a fashion trend may start. People who like or respect these people become influenced by their personal style and begin wearing similarly styled clothes. Fashions may vary considerably within a [[society]] according to [[Aging (life cycle)|age]], [[social class]], [[generation]], [[Profession|occupation]], and [[geography]] and may also vary over time. If an older person dresses according to the fashion young people use, he or she may look ridiculous in the eyes of both young and older people. The terms ''fashionista'' and ''[[fashion victim]]'' refer to someone who slavishly follows current fashions.

One can regard the system of sporting various fashions as a fashion [[language]] incorporating various fashion statements using a [[grammar]] of fashion. (Compare some of the work of [[Roland Barthes]].)

In recent years, Asian fashion has become increasingly significant in local and global markets. Countries such as China, Japan, India, and Pakistan have traditionally had large textile industries, which have often been drawn upon by Western designers, but now Asian clothing styles are also gaining influence based on their own ideas.&lt;ref&gt;Lemire, B., &amp; Riello, G (2008).

==Fashion industry==
[[File:Romantic fashion model.JPG|thumb]]

The fashion industry is a product of the modern age.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopædia Britannica, Retrieved  from http://global.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/1706624/fashion-industry&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to the mid-19th century, most clothing was [[Made to measure|custom-made]]. It was handmade for individuals, either as home production or on order from dressmakers and tailors. By the beginning of the 20th century—with the rise of new technologies such as the [[sewing machine]], the rise of global capitalism and the development of the factory system of production, and the proliferation of retail outlets such as department stores—clothing had increasingly come to be [[mass production|mass-produced]] in standard sizes and sold at fixed prices.

Although the fashion industry developed first in Europe and America, {{as of | 2015 | lc = on}} it is an international and highly globalized industry, with clothing often designed in one country, manufactured in another, and sold world-wide. For example, an American fashion company might source fabric in China and have the clothes manufactured in [[Vietnam]], finished in [[Italy]], and shipped to a warehouse in the United States for distribution to retail outlets internationally. The fashion industry has long been one of the largest employers in the United States,&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopædia Britannica, Retrieved from http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/1706624/fashion-industry#toc296474&lt;/ref&gt; and it remains so in the 21st century. However, U.S. employment declined considerably as production increasingly moved overseas, especially to China. Because data on the fashion industry typically are reported for national economies and expressed in terms of the industry's many separate sectors, aggregate figures for world production of textiles and clothing are difficult to obtain. However, by any measure, the clothing industry accounts for a significant share of world economic output.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nymag.com/news/intelligencer/cheap-clothes-2012-6/|title=How Bargain Fashion Chains Will Keep Themselves Cut-Rate -- New York Magazine|work=NYMag.com|accessdate=26 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The fashion industry consists of four levels:

# the production of raw materials, principally fibers and textiles but also leather and fur.
# the production of fashion goods by designers, manufacturers, contractors, and others.
# retail sales
# various forms of advertising and promotion

These levels consist of many separate but interdependent sectors. These sectors are Textile Design and Production, Fashion Design and Manufacturing, Fashion Retailing, Marketing and Merchandising, Fashion Shows, and Media and Marketing. Each sector is devoted to the goal of satisfying consumer demand for apparel under conditions that enable participants in the industry to operate at a profit.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopædia Britannica, Retrieved from http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/1706624/fashion-industry, http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/1706624/fashion-industry/296476/Fashion-design-and-manufacturing, http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/1706624/fashion-industry/296477/Fashion-retailing-marketing-and-merchandising, http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/1706624/fashion-industry/296479/Media-and-marketing&lt;/ref&gt;

==Media==
The media plays a significant role when it comes to fashion. For instance, an important part of fashion is [[fashion journalism]]. Editorial critique, guidelines, and commentary can be found on television and in magazines, newspapers, fashion websites,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Fashion Websites like Nytime's Men's Style|url=http://www.nytimes.com-ssl.website/pages/fashion/mens-style/index.html|newspaper=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[social networks|Social network]], and [[fashion blog]]s. In recent years, fashion blogging and [[YouTube]] videos have become a major outlet for spreading trends and fashion tips, creating an online culture of sharing one's style on a website or [[Instagram]] account. Through these media outlets readers and viewers all over the world can learn about fashion, making it very accessible.&lt;ref&gt;Fashion (2012, March 29). Wwd. (n.d.). Retrieved from http://www.wwd.com/fashion-news&lt;/ref&gt;

At the beginning of the 20th century, fashion magazines began to include photographs of various fashion designs and became even more influential than in the past. In cities throughout the world these magazines were greatly sought after and had a profound effect on public taste in clothing. Talented [[illustrator]]s drew exquisite fashion plates for the publications which covered the most recent developments in fashion and [[beauty]]. Perhaps the most famous of these magazines was ''[[La Gazette du Bon Ton]]'', which was founded in 1912 by [[Lucien Vogel]] and regularly published until 1925 (with the exception of the war years).{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}

''[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]]'', founded in the [[United States]] in 1892, has been the longest-lasting and most successful of the hundreds of fashion magazines that have come and gone. Increasing affluence after [[World War&amp;nbsp;II]] and, most importantly, the advent of cheap [[color printing]] in the 1960s, led to a huge boost in its sales and heavy coverage of fashion in mainstream women's magazines, followed by men's magazines in the 1990s. One such example of ''Vogue'''s popularity is the younger version, ''[[Teen Vogue]]'', which covers clothing and trends that are targeted more toward the &quot;fashionista on a budget&quot;. [[Haute couture]] designers followed the trend by starting [[ready-to-wear]] and [[perfume]] lines which are heavily advertised in the magazines and now dwarf their original couture businesses. A recent development within fashion print media is the rise of text-based and critical magazines which aim to prove that fashion is not superficial, by creating a dialogue between fashion academia and the industry. Examples of this trend are: ''[[Fashion Theory (journal)|Fashion Theory]]'' (1997)  and ''[[Vestoj]]'' (2009). Television coverage began in the 1950s with small fashion features. In the 1960s and 1970s, fashion segments on various entertainment shows became more frequent, and by the 1980s, dedicated fashion shows such as ''[[Fashion Television]]'' started to appear. ''[[FashionTV]]'' was the pioneer in this undertaking and has since grown to become the leader in both Fashion Television and [[new media]] channels.

However, over the past several years, fashion websites have developed that merge traditional editorial writing with [[user-generated content]]. Online magazines like ''[[iFashion Network]]'' and ''Runway Magazine'', led by [[Nole Marin]] from ''[[America's Next Top Model]]'', have begun to dominate the market with digital copies for computers, [[iPhones]], and [[iPads]]. Example platforms include Apple and Android for such applications.

A few days after the 2010 Fall Fashion Week in [[New York City]] came to a close, ''[[The New Islander]]'''s Fashion Editor, Genevieve Tax, criticized the fashion industry for running on a seasonal schedule of its own, largely at the expense of real-world consumers. &quot;Because designers release their fall collections in the spring and their spring collections in the fall, fashion magazines such as ''Vogue'' always and only look forward to the upcoming season, promoting [[parka]]s come September while issuing reviews on shorts in January&quot;, she writes. &quot;Savvy shoppers, consequently, have been conditioned to be extremely, perhaps impractically, farsighted with their buying.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Tax, Genevieve.

The fashion industry has been the subject of numerous films and television shows, including the reality show ''[[Project Runway]]'' and the drama series ''[[Ugly Betty]]''. Specific fashion brands have been featured in film, not only as [[product placement]] opportunities, but as bespoke items that have subsequently led to trends in fashion.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, S.B.N., Hussein, Y., Jones, N. Designing for the famous – psychology of building a brand in haute couture shoe design and fashion. Design Principles &amp; Practices: An International Journal 2011;5(5):1–25.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Videos in general have been very useful in promoting the fashion industry. This is evident not only from television shows directly spotlighting the fashion industry, but also movies, events and music videos which showcase fashion statements as well as promote specific brands through product placements. 

==Public relations and social media==
Fashion [[public relations]] involves being in touch with a company’s audiences and creating strong relationships with them, reaching out to media and initiating messages that project positive images of the company.&lt;ref&gt;Sherman, G., &amp; Perlman, S. (2010). Fashion public relations. New York: Fairchild Books. In Cassidy, L. &amp; Fitch, K. (2013) Beyond the Catwalk: Fashion Public Relations and Social Media in Australia, Asia Pacific Public Relations Journal, vol. 14, No. 1 &amp; 2, Murdoch University.&lt;/ref&gt; Social media plays an important role in modern-day fashion public relations; enabling practitioners to reach a wide range of consumers through various platforms.

Building brand awareness and credibility is a key implication of good public relations. In some cases, great hype is built about new designers' collections before they are released into the market, due to the immense exposure generated by practitioners.&lt;ref&gt;Westfield, A. M. (2002) The Role of Public Relations in Redefining Brands in the Fashion Industry, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, California.&lt;/ref&gt; Social media, such as blogs, micro blogs, podcasts, photo and video sharing sites have all become increasingly important to fashion public relations.&lt;ref&gt;Experian. (2012). Getting the most from social: An integrated marketing approach. Retrieved from www.experian.com.au/assets/social/getting-the-most-from-social.pdf in Cassidy, L. &amp; Fitch, K. (2013) Beyond the Catwalk: Fashion Public Relations and Social Media in Australia, Asia Pacific Public Relations Journal, vol. 14, No. 1 &amp; 2, Murdoch University.&lt;/ref&gt; The interactive nature of these platforms allows practitioners to engage and communicate with publics in real time, and tailor their clients’ brand or campaign messages to the target audience. With blogging platforms such as Instagram, Tumblr, Wordpress, and other sharing sites, bloggers have emerged as expert fashion commentators, shaping brands and having a great impact on what is ‘on trend’.&lt;ref&gt;Dalto, A. (2010, September). Brands tempt female bloggers with ‘swag’. O’Dwyer’s Communications and New Media: The Fashion Issue, 24(9), 12–13. Retrieved from http://www.odwyerpr.com/profiles/O%27Dwyer%27s%20Magazine%20-%20Sep.%202010.pdf in Cassidy, L. &amp; Fitch, K. (2013) Beyond the Catwalk: Fashion Public Relations and Social Media in Australia, Asia Pacific Public Relations Journal, vol. 14, No. 1 &amp; 2, Murdoch University.&lt;/ref&gt; Women in the fashion public relations industry such as Sweaty Betty PR founder [[Roxy Jacenko]] and Oscar de la Renta’s PR girl Erika Bearman, have acquired copious amounts of followers on their social media sites, by providing a brand identity and a behind the scenes look into the companies they work for.

Social media is changing the way practitioners deliver messages,&lt;ref name=&quot;conceitom.com.br&quot;/&gt; as they are concerned with the media, and also customer relationship building.&lt;ref&gt;Noricks, C. (2006). From style to strategy: An exploratory investigation of public relations practice in the fashion industry. Unpublished master’s thesis, San Diego State University, San Diego, CA. in Cassidy, L. &amp; Fitch, K. (2013) Beyond the Catwalk: Fashion Public Relations and Social Media in Australia, Asia Pacific Public Relations Journal, vol. 14, No. 1 &amp; 2, Murdoch University.&lt;/ref&gt; PR practitioners must provide effective communication among all platforms, in order to engage fashion publics in an industry socially connected via online shopping.&lt;ref&gt;Wright, M. (2011). How premium fashion brands are maximising their social media ROI. Mashable. Retrieved from www.mashable.com/2011/02/11/fashion-brands-social-media-roi/ in Cassidy, L. &amp; Fitch, K. (2013) Beyond the Catwalk: Fashion Public Relations and Social Media in Australia, Asia Pacific Public Relations Journal, vol. 14, No. 1 &amp; 2, Murdoch University.&lt;/ref&gt; Consumers have the ability to share their purchases on their personal social media pages (such as Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, etc.), and if practitioners deliver the brand message effectively and meet the needs of its publics, word-of-mouth publicity will be generated and potentially provide a wide reach for the designer and their products.

==Anthropological perspective==
[[Anthropology]], the study of culture and human societies, studies fashion by asking why certain styles are deemed socially appropriate and others are not. A certain way is chosen and that becomes the fashion as defined by a certain people as a whole, so if a particular style has a meaning in an already occurring set of beliefs that style will become fashion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Molnar|first=Andrea K|title=Transformations in the Use of Traditional Textiles of Ngada (Western Flores, Eastern Indonesia):  Commercialization, Fashion and Ethnicity|year=1998|publisher=Berg|location=Consuming Fashion: Adorning the Transnational Body|pages=39–55 [42]}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Ted Polhemus and Lynn Procter, fashion can be described as adornment, of which there are two types: fashion and anti-fashion. Through the capitalization and commoditisation of clothing, accessories, and shoes, etc., what once constituted anti-fashion becomes part of fashion as the lines between fashion and anti-fashion are blurred.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Polhemus and Procter|first=Ted and Lynn|title=Fashion and Anti-fashion:  An Anthropology of Clothing and Adornment|year=1978|publisher=Thames and Hudson|page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The definition of fashion and [[anti-fashion]] is as follows:  Anti-fashion is fixed and changes little over time.  Anti-fashion is different depending on the cultural or social group one is associated with or where one lives, but within that group or locality the style changes little.  Fashion is the exact opposite of anti-fashion.  Fashion changes very quickly and is not affiliated with one group or area of the world but is spread out throughout the world wherever people can communicate easily with each other. For example, Queen Elizabeth II’s 1953 coronation gown is an example of anti-fashion because it is traditional and does not change over any period whereas a gown from fashion designer Dior’s collection of 1953 is fashion because the style will change every season as Dior comes up with a new gown to replace the old one. In the Dior gown the length, cut, fabric, and embroidery of the gown change from season to season.  Anti-fashion is concerned with maintaining the status quo while fashion is concerned with social mobility. Time is expressed in terms of continuity in anti-fashion and as change in fashion. Fashion has changing modes of adornment while anti-fashion has fixed modes of adornment. Indigenous and [[peasant]] modes of adornment are an example of anti-fashion. Change in fashion is part of the larger system and is structured to be a deliberate change in style.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Polhemus and Procter|first=Ted and Lynn|title=Fashion and Anti-fashion:  An Anthropology of Clothing and Adornment|year=1978|publisher=Thames and Hudson|pages=12–13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, people in rich countries are linked to people in poor countries through the commoditization and consumption of what is called fashion.  People work long hours in one area of the globe to produce things that people in another part of the globe are anxious to consume. An example of this is the chain of production and consumption of [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]] shoes, which are produced in Taiwan and then purchased in North America. At the production end, there is nation-building a hard working ideology that leads people to produce and entices people to consume with a vast amount of goods for the offering{{clarify|date=June 2015}}. Commodities are no longer just utilitarian but are fashionable, be they running shoes or sweat suits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Skoggard|first=Ian|title=Transnational Commodity Flows and the Global Phenomenon of the Brand|year=1998|publisher=Berg|location=Consuming Fashion: Adorning the Transnational Body|pages=57–69}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The change from anti-fashion to fashion because of the influence of western consumer-driven civilization can be seen in eastern [[Indonesia]]. The ikat textiles of the Ngada area of eastern Indonesia are changing because of modernization and development. Traditionally, in the Ngada area there was no idea similar to that of the Western idea of fashion, but anti-fashion in the form of traditional textiles and ways to adorn oneself were widely popular. Textiles in Indonesia have played many roles for the local people.  Textiles defined a person’s rank and status; certain textiles indicated being part of the ruling class.  People expressed their ethnic identity and social hierarchy through textiles.  Because some Indonesians bartered ikat textiles for food, the textiles constituted economic goods, and as some textile design motifs had spiritual religious meanings, textiles were also a way to communicate religious messages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Molnar|first=Andrea K|title=Transformations in the Use of Traditional Textiles of Ngada (Western Flores, Eastern Indonesia):  Commercialization, Fashion and Ethnicity|year=1998|publisher=Berg|location=Consuming Fashion: Adorning the Transnational Body|pages=39–43}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In eastern Indonesia, both the production and use of traditional textiles have been transformed as the production, use and value associated with textiles have changed due to modernization.  In the past, women produced the textiles either for home consumption or to trade with others.  Today, this has changed as most textiles are not being produced at home. Western goods are considered modern and are valued more than traditional goods, including the sarong, which retain a lingering association with [[colonialism]].  Now, sarongs are used only for rituals and ceremonial occasions, whereas western clothes are worn to church or government offices. Civil servants working in urban areas are more likely than peasants to make the distinction between western and traditional clothes. Following Indonesia’s independence from the Dutch, people increasingly started buying factory made shirts and sarongs. In textile-producing areas the growing of cotton and production of naturally colored thread became obsolete. Traditional motifs on textiles are no longer considered the property of a certain social class or age group. Wives of government officials are promoting the use of traditional textiles in the form of western garments such as skirts, vests and blouses.  This trend is also being followed by the general populace, and whoever can afford to hire a tailor is doing so to stitch traditional ikat textiles into western clothes. Thus, traditional textiles are now fashion goods and are no longer confined to the black, white and brown colour palette but come in array of colours. Traditional textiles are also being used in interior decorations and to make handbags, wallets and other accessories, which are considered fashionable by civil servants and their families. There is also a booming tourist trade in the eastern Indonesian city of Kupang where international as well as domestic tourists are eager to purchase traditionally printed western goods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Molnar|first=Andrea K|title=Transformations in the Use of Traditional Textiles of Ngada (Western Flores, Eastern Indonesia):  Commercialization, Fashion and Ethnicity|year=1998|publisher=Berg|location=Consuming Fashion: Adorning the Transnational Body|page=41 and 45–48}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of traditional textiles for fashion is becoming big business in eastern Indonesia, but these traditional textiles are losing their ethnic identity markers and are being used as an item of fashion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Molnar|first=Andrea K|title=Transformations in the Use of Traditional Textiles of Ngada (Western Flores, Eastern Indonesia):  Commercialization, Fashion and Ethnicity|year=1998|publisher=Berg|location=Consuming Fashion: Adorning the Transnationa}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Intellectual property==
[[File:04162012fashion marketing054.jpg|thumb|Student modeling at the &quot;Fashion marketing&quot; event at the [[Monterrey Institute of Technology and Higher Education, Mexico City]].]]
In the fashion industry, [[intellectual property]] is not enforced as it is within the [[film industry]] and [[music industry]]. Robert Glariston, an intellectual property expert, mentioned in a fashion seminar held in LA{{which|date=March 2014}} that &quot;Copyright law regarding clothing is a current hot-button issue in the industry. We often have to draw the line between designers being inspired by a design and those outright stealing it in different places.&quot;{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}  To take inspiration from others' designs contributes to the fashion industry's ability to establish clothing trends. For the past few years, [[WGSN (fashion forecaster)|WGSN]] has been a dominant source of fashion news and forecasts in encouraging fashion brands worldwide to be inspired by one another. Enticing consumers to buy clothing by establishing new trends is, some have argued, a key component of the industry's success. Intellectual property rules that interfere with this process of trend-making would, in this view, be counter-productive. On the other hand, it is often argued that the blatant theft of new ideas, unique designs, and design details by larger companies is what often contributes to the failure of many smaller or independent design companies.

Since fakes are distinguishable by their poorer quality, there is still a demand for luxury goods, and as only a [[trademark]] or [[logo]] can be copyrighted, many fashion brands make this one of the most visible aspects of the garment or accessory. In handbags, especially, the designer's brand may be woven into the fabric (or the lining fabric) from which the bag is made, making the brand an intrinsic element of the bag.

In 2005, the [[World Intellectual Property Organization]] (WIPO) held a conference calling for stricter intellectual property enforcement within the fashion industry to better protect small and medium businesses and promote competitiveness within the textile and clothing industries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ipfrontline.com/depts/article.asp?id=7678&amp;deptid=8 IPFrontline.com]: Intellectual Property in Fashion Industry, WIPO press release, December 2, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.insme.org/page.asp?IDArea=1&amp;page=sanleucio INSME announcement]: WIPO-Italy International Symposium, 30 November – 2 December 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political activism==
Fashion may be used to promote a cause, such as to promote [[healthy]] behavior,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Fashion For A Cause|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2013-02-04/parties/36742432_1_world-cancer-cancer-day-fashion-show|accessdate=2013-02-15|newspaper=Times of India|date=2013-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; to raise money for a [[cancer cure]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Woodman|first=Anne|title=Fashion for a cause|url=http://www.newsobserver.com/2013/01/29/2630417/fashion-for-a-cause.html|accessdate=2013-02-15|newspaper=Clayton News Star|date=2013-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; or to raise money for local [[charities]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Fashion for a cause|url=http://www.chathamdailynews.ca/2013/02/07/fashion-for-a-cause|accessdate=2013-02-15|newspaper=Chatham Daily News|date=2013-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as the [[Juvenile Protective Association]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=luc|first=karie angell|title=‘Fashion for a Cause’ aids families and kids|url=http://northbrook.suntimes.com/lifestyles/trend/17445677-423/fashion-for-a-cause-aids-families-and-kids.html|accessdate=2013-02-15|newspaper=Northbrook Star|date=2013-01-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; or a [[children's hospice]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Fashion for a cause|url=http://www.capitalgazette.com/calendar/fashion-for-a-cause/event_b6724a0e-8e3a-11e1-b219-6f4af5ab0114.html|accessdate=2013-02-15|newspaper=Capital Gazette&lt;!--|date=no date given--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One up-and-coming fashion cause is [[trashion]], which is using trash to make clothes, jewelery and other fashion items in order to promote awareness of pollution. There are a number of modern trashion artists such as Marina DeBris, Ann Wizer,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=One man’s trash is another man’s fashion|url=http://www.today.com/id/25497155/site/todayshow/ns/today-green/t/one-mans-trash-another-mans-fashion/#.UR8RDmeHiSo|accessdate=2013-02-15|newspaper=NBC News/ AP|date=2008-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Nancy Judd.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Simon|first=Stephanie|title='Trashion' Trend: Dumpster Couture Gets a Boost at Green Inaugural Ball|url=http://online.wsj.com/article/SB123180107217975103.html|accessdate=2013-02-15|newspaper=Wall Street Journal|date=2009-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''holiday''' is a day set aside by custom or by law on which normal activities, especially business or work, are suspended or reduced. Generally, holidays are intended to allow individuals to celebrate or commemorate an event or tradition of cultural or religious significance. Holidays may be designated by governments, religious institutions, or other groups or organizations. The degree to which normal activities are reduced by a holiday may depend on local laws, customs, the type of job being held or even personal choices.

The concept of holidays has most often originated in connection with religious observances. The intention of a holiday was typically to allow individuals to tend to religious duties associated with important dates on the calendar. In most modern societies, however, holidays serve as much of a recreational function as any other weekend days or activities.

In many societies there are important distinctions between holidays designated by governments and holidays designated by religious institutions. For example, in many predominantly Christian nations, government-designed holidays may center on Christian holidays, though non-Christians may instead observe religious holidays associated with their faith. In some cases, a holiday may only be nominally observed. For example, many Jews in the Americas and Europe treat the relatively minor Jewish holiday of [[Hanukkah]] as a &quot;working holiday&quot;, changing very little of their daily routines for this day.

The word &quot;holiday&quot; has some variance in meaning across different locales. In the United States the word refers to widely observed days of rest and recreation, whereas in the U.K. and many Commonwealth nations including Canada, the word refers to any extended period of recreation. It is this first, more restricted sense of the word that concerns this article.

==Etymology==

The word ''holiday'' comes from the [[Old English]] word ''hāligdæg'' (''hālig'' &quot;[[holy]]&quot; + ''dæg'' &quot;[[day]]&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;[http://etymonline.com/?term=holiday etymonline.com]&lt;/ref&gt; The word originally referred only to special religious days. In modern use, it means any special day of rest or relaxation, as opposed to normal days away from work or school.

==Types of holiday (observance)==
{{Further|Lists of holidays}}

===Religious holidays===

Many holidays are linked to [[faith]]s and [[religion]]s (see etymology above). [[Christian]] holidays are defined as part of the [[liturgical year]], the chief ones being [[Easter]] and [[Christmas]]. The Orthodox Christian and Western-Roman Catholic [[fiesta patronal|patronal feast day or &quot;name day&quot;]] are celebrated in each place's patron saint's day, according to the [[Calendar of saints]]. [[Jehovah's Witnesses]] annually commemorate &quot;The Memorial of Jesus Christ's Death&quot;, but do not celebrate other holidays with any religious significance such as Easter, Christmas or New Year's. This holds especially true for those holidays that have combined and absorbed rituals, overtones or practices from non-Christian beliefs into the celebration, as well as those holidays that distract from or replace the worship of Jehovah.&lt;ref&gt;Watchtower Bible and Tract Society of Pennsylvania. ''Reasoning from the Scriptures''. Watchtower, 1985, pp. 176–182&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Islam]], the largest [[Muslim holidays|holidays]] are [[Eid ul-Fitr]] (immediately after [[Ramadan]]) and [[Eid al-Adha]] (at the end of the [[Hajj]]). [[Ahmadi Muslims]] additionally celebrate [[Promised Messiah Day]], [[Promised Reformer Day]], and [[Khilafat Day]], but contrary to popular belief, neither are regarded as holidays. [[Hindu]]s, [[Jainism|Jains]] and [[Sikh]]s observe several holidays, one of the largest being [[Diwali]] (Festival of Light). [[Public holidays in Japan|Japanese holidays]] contain references to several different faiths and beliefs. Celtic, Norse, and [[Neopaganism|Neopagan]] holidays follow the order of the [[Wheel of the Year]]. Some are closely linked to [[Swedish festivities]]. The [[Bahá'í Faith]] observes [[Bahá'í calendar#Holy_days|holidays]] as defined by the [[Bahá'í calendar]]. Jews have two holiday seasons: the Spring Feasts of [[Pesach]] (Passover) and [[Shavuot]] (Weeks, called [[Pentecost]] in Greek); and the Fall Feasts of [[Rosh Hashanah]] (Head of the Year), [[Yom Kippur]] (Day of Atonement), [[Sukkot]] (Tabernacles), and [[Shemini Atzeret]] (Eighth Day of Assembly).

===Northern Hemisphere winter holidays===
{{Main|Christmas and holiday season}}

Winter in the [[Northern Hemisphere]] features many holidays that involve [[List of winter festivals|festivals and feasts]]. The Christmas and holiday season surrounds the [[Christmas]] and other holidays, and is celebrated by many religions and cultures. Usually, this period begins near the start of November and ends with [[New Year's Day]]. ''Holiday season'' is, somewhat, a commercial term that applies, in the US, to the period that begins with Thanksgiving and ends with New Year's Eve. Some [[Christianity|Christian]] countries consider the end of the festive season to be after the feast of [[Epiphany (holiday)|Epiphany]].

===National holidays===
{{See also|National Day}}
[[Sovereign]] nations and territories observe holidays based on events of significance to their history. For example, Americans celebrate [[Independence Day (United States)|Independence Day]], celebrating the signing of the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]] in 1776.

===Other secular holidays===
{{Category see also|Secular holidays}}
Other [[secular]] (non-religious) holidays are observed nationally, [[International observance|internationally]] (often in conjunction with organizations such as the [[United Nations]]), and across multi-country regions. An example of a major secular holiday is the [[Lunar New Year]], which is celebrated across Asia. Many other days are marked to celebrate events or people, but are not strictly holidays as time off work is rarely given; examples include [[Arbor Day]] (originally US), [[Labor Day]] (celebrated sometimes under different names and on different days in different countries), and [[Earth Day]] (22 April).

===Unofficial holidays===
{{Category see also|Unofficial observances}}
These are holidays that are not traditionally marked on calendars. These holidays are celebrated by various groups and individuals. Some promote a cause, others recognize historical events not officially recognized, and others are &quot;funny&quot; holidays celebrated with humorous intent. For example, [[Monkey Day]] is celebrated on December 14, [[International Talk Like a Pirate Day]] is observed on September 19, and [[Blasphemy Day]] is held on September 30.  [[April Fool's Day]] on April 1 is also another example.

In the nineteenth century, cultural anthropologist Sir James Frazer studied the practices of Northern Celtic people on ''Hallowmas'' (a term that has come to describe the three day period of October 31st, Halloween, November 1st, All Saints' Day, and November 2nd, All Souls' Day). He asserted that the traditions of Hallowmas were rooted in Samhain, and he claimed that the ancient pagan festival had been a day to honor the dead.

==Etymology==
The word ''Halloween'' or ''Hallowe'en'' dates to about 1745&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=Halloween&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 |title=Online Etymology Dictionary: Halloween |publisher=Etymonline.com |accessdate=13 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is of Christian origin.&lt;ref&gt;''The A to Z of Anglicanism'' (Colin Buchanan), Scarecrow Press, page 8&lt;/ref&gt; The word &quot;Hallowe'en&quot; means &quot;[[hallowed]] evening&quot; or &quot;holy evening&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;''The American Desk Encyclopedia'' (Steve Luck), Oxford University Press, page 365&lt;/ref&gt; It comes from a Scottish term for ''All Hallows' Eve'' (the evening before [[All Saints' Day|All Hallows' Day]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;oed&quot;/&gt; In [[Scots language|Scots]], the word &quot;eve&quot; is ''even'', and this is contracted to ''e'en'' or ''een''. Over time, ''(All) Hallow(s) E(v)en'' evolved into ''Hallowe'en''. Although the phrase &quot;All Hallows'&quot; is found in [[Old English]] (''ealra hālgena mæssedæg'', all saints mass-day), &quot;All Hallows' Eve&quot; is itself not seen until 1556.&lt;ref name=&quot;oed&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=The Oxford English Dictionary |edition=2nd |year=1989 |publisher=Oxford Univ.

[[File:Traditional-irish-halloween-mask.jpg|thumbnail|200px|left|An early 20th-century Irish Hallowe'en mask displayed at the [[Museum of Country Life]].]]

Today's Halloween customs are thought to have been influenced by [[Folk culture|folk]] customs and beliefs from the [[Celtic nations|Celtic-speaking countries]], some of which are believed to have [[Celtic polytheism|pagan]] roots.&lt;ref name=&quot;rogers_s&quot;&gt;Rogers, Nicholas (2002). &quot;Samhain and the Celtic Origins of Halloween&quot;.

''The Hallowed Eve: Dimensions of Culture in a Calendar Festival of Northern Ireland''. University Press of Kentucky, p.95&lt;/ref&gt; Historian Nicholas Rogers, exploring the origins of Halloween, notes that while &quot;some folklorists have detected its origins in the Roman feast of [[Pomona (mythology)|Pomona]], the goddess of fruits and seeds, or in the [[festival of the dead]] called [[Parentalia]], it is more typically linked to the Celtic festival of [[Samhain]]&quot;, which comes from the [[Old Irish]] for &quot;summer's end&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;rogers_s&quot;/&gt; Samhain (pronounced {{Respell|SAH|win}} or {{Respell|SOW|in}}) was the first and most important of the four [[quarter days]] in the medieval [[Gaels|Gaelic]] calendar and was celebrated in Ireland, [[Scotland]] and the [[Isle of Man]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Roud&quot;&gt;''A Pocket Guide To Superstitions Of The British Isles'' (Publisher: Penguin Books Ltd; Reprint edition: 4 November 2004) ISBN 0-14-051549-6&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;bbc_halloween&quot;&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/christianity/holydays/halloween_1.shtml All Hallows' Eve] BBC.

Impersonating these beings, or wearing a disguise, was also believed to protect oneself from them.&lt;ref&gt;Hole, Christina. ''British Folk Customs''. Hutchinson, 1976. p.91&lt;/ref&gt; It is suggested that the mummers and guisers &quot;personify the old spirits of the winter, who demanded reward in exchange for good fortune&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Peddle, S.

A man dressed as a ''Láir Bhán'' ([[White horse (mythology)|white mare]]) led youths house-to-house reciting verses—some of which had pagan overtones—in exchange for food.

===Christian influence===
{{Christianity|state=collapsed}}
Today's Halloween customs are also thought to have been influenced by Christian dogma and practices derived from it. Halloween is the evening before the [[Christian]] holy days of [[All Saints' Day|All Hallows' Day]] (also known as ''All Saints' or Hallowmas'') on 1 November and [[All Souls' Day]] on 2 November, thus giving the holiday on 31 October the full name of ''All Hallows' Eve'' (meaning the evening before All Hallows' Day).&lt;ref name=&quot;rogers_religion&quot;&gt;Rogers, Nicholas (2002). ''Halloween: From Pagan Ritual to Party Night'', pp. 22, 27. New York: [[Oxford University Press|Oxford Univ. Press]].

Lathrop), Fortress Press, page 92&lt;/ref&gt; [[Calendar of saints#Ranking of feast days|major feasts]] in the [[Christian Church]] (such as [[Christmas]], [[Easter]] and [[Pentecost]]) had [[vigil]]s which began the night before, as did the feast of All Hallows'.&lt;ref&gt;''Hallowe'en, A Christian Name with Blended Christian &amp; Folk Traditions'' (Thomas L. Weitzel), Evangelical Lutheran Church in America&lt;/ref&gt; These three days are collectively referred to as [[Allhallowtide]] and are a time for honoring the [[saint]]s and praying for the recently departed [[Soul in the Bible|souls]] who have yet to reach Heaven. All Saints was introduced in the year 609, but was originally celebrated on 13 May,&lt;ref name=hutton364&gt;Hutton, p.364&lt;/ref&gt; the same date as [[Lemuria (festival)|Lemuria]], an [[Religion in ancient Rome|ancient Roman]] festival of the dead. In 835, it was officially switched to 1 November, the same date as Samhain, at the behest of [[Pope Gregory IV]].&lt;ref name=hutton364/&gt; Some suggest this was due to Celtic influence, while others suggest it was a Germanic idea,&lt;ref name=hutton364/&gt; although it is claimed that both Germanic and Celtic-speaking peoples commemorated the dead at the beginning of winter.&lt;ref name=macculloch10&gt;MacCulloch, John Arnott (1911). ''The Religion of the Ancient Celts''. [http://sacred-texts.com/neu/celt/rac/rac13.htm Chapter 10: The Cult of the Dead].&lt;/ref&gt; It may have been seen as the most fitting time to do so, as it was when the plants themselves were 'dying'.&lt;ref name=hutton364/&gt;&lt;ref name=macculloch10/&gt; It is also suggested that the change was made on the &quot;practical grounds that Rome in summer could not accommodate the great number of pilgrims who flocked to it&quot;, and perhaps because of [[public health]] considerations regarding [[Roman Fever (disease)|Roman Fever]] – a disease that claimed a number of lives during the sultry summers of the region.&lt;ref&gt;''Butler's Saint for the Day'' (Paul Burns), Liturgical Press, page 516&lt;/ref&gt;

In parts of Britain, these customs came under attack during the [[English Reformation|Reformation]] as some [[Protestant]]s berated purgatory as a &quot;[[popish]]&quot; doctrine incompatible with their notion of [[predestination]]. Thus, for some [[Nonconformism|Nonconformist Protestants]], the [[Christian theology|theology]] of All Hallows’ Eve was redefined; without the doctrine of purgatory, &quot;the returning souls cannot be journeying from Purgatory on their way to Heaven, as Catholics frequently believe and assert.

One held a bunch of burning straw on a [[pitchfork]] while the rest knelt around him in a circle, praying for the souls of relatives and friends until the flames went out. This was known as ''teen'lay'', derived either from the [[Old English]] ''tendan'' (to kindle) or a word related to [[Old Irish]] ''tenlach'' (hearth).&lt;ref name=hutton373&gt;[[Ronald Hutton|Hutton, Ronald]].

==Trick-or-treating and guising==
{{Main| Trick-or-treating}}
[[File:Trick or treat in sweden.jpeg|thumb||upright|Trick-or-treaters in [[Sweden]]]]

Trick-or-treating is a customary celebration for children on Halloween. Children go in costume from house to house, asking for treats such as [[confectionary|candy]] or sometimes money, with the question, &quot;Trick or treat?&quot; The word &quot;trick&quot; refers to &quot;threat&quot; to perform mischief on the homeowners or their property if no treat is given.&lt;ref name=Britannica&gt;{{cite web|title=Halloween|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/252875/Halloween|work=Britannica|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica|accessdate=25 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The practice is said to have roots in the medieval practice of [[mumming]], which is closely related to [[souling]].&lt;ref&gt;''Faces Around the World: A Cultural Encyclopedia of the Human Face'' (Margo DeMello), ABC-CLIO, page 225&lt;/ref&gt; John Pymm writes that &quot;many of the feast days associated with the presentation of mumming plays were celebrated by the Christian Church.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''A Student's Guide to A2 Performance Studies for the OCR Specification'' (John Pymm), Rhinegold Publishing Ltd, page 28&lt;/ref&gt; These [[feast day]]s included All Hallows' Eve, Christmas, [[Twelfth Night (holiday)|Twelfth Night]] and [[Shrove Tuesday]].&lt;ref&gt;''Folklore: An Encyclopedia of Beliefs, Customs, Tales, Music, and Art, Volume 1'' (Thomas Green), ABC-CLIO page 566&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Interacting communities: studies on some aspects of migration and urban ethnology'' (Zsuzsa Szarvas), Hungarian Ethnographic Society, page 314&lt;/ref&gt; Mumming, practiced in Germany, Scandinavia and other parts of Europe,&lt;ref&gt;''The Oxford Encyclopedia of British Literature'' (David Scott Kastan), Oxford University Press, page 47&lt;/ref&gt; involved masked persons in [[fancy dress]] who &quot;paraded the streets and entered houses to dance or play dice in silence.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Mumming Play&quot;, ''Encyclopædia Britannica''&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Souling on Halloween.png|150px|thumb|Souling was a Christian practice carried out in many English towns on Halloween and Christmas.]]

American historian and author [[Ruth Edna Kelley]] of [[Massachusetts]] wrote the first book length history of Halloween in the US; ''[[:s:The Book of Hallowe'en|The Book of Hallowe'en]]'' (1919), and references souling in the chapter &quot;Hallowe'en in America&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Kelley, Ruth Edna.

While the first reference to &quot;guising&quot; in North America occurs in 1911, another reference to ritual begging on Halloween appears, place unknown, in 1915, with a third reference in Chicago in 1920.&lt;ref&gt;Theo. E. Wright, &quot;A Halloween Story,&quot; ''St. Nicholas'', October 1915, p. 1144. Mae McGuire Telford, &quot;What Shall We Do Halloween?&quot; ''[[Ladies Home Journal]]'', October 1920, p. 135.&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest known use in print of the term &quot;trick or treat&quot; appears in 1927, in the ''Blackie Herald'' [[Blackie, Alberta|Alberta]], Canada.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;'Trick or Treat' Is Demand,&quot; ''Herald'' ([[Lethbridge]], [[Alberta]]), 4 November 1927, p. 5, dateline [[Blackie, Alberta]], 3 Nov..&lt;/ref&gt;

The thousands of Halloween postcards produced between the turn of the 20th century and the 1920s commonly show children but not trick-or-treating.&lt;ref&gt;For examples, see the websites [http://www.emotionscards.com/museum/hallow1.html Postcard &amp; Greeting Card Museum: Halloween Gallery], [http://www.shaktiweb.com/postcards/ Antique Hallowe'en Postcards], [http://antiques.about.com/od/collectingbookspaper/ig/Halloween-Postcard-Gallery/index.htm Vintage Halloween Postcards], and [http://archive.is/yNvd Morticia's Morgue Antique Halloween Postcards].&lt;/ref&gt; Trick-or-treating does not seem to have become a widespread practice until the 1930s, with the first U.S. appearances of the term in 1934,&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Halloween Pranks Keep Police on Hop,&quot; ''[[Oregon Journal]]'' ([[Portland, Oregon]]), 1 November 1934; and &quot;The Gangsters of Tomorrow&quot;, ''The Helena Independent'' ([[Helena, Montana]]), 2 November 1934, p. 4. The ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' also mentioned door-to-door begging in [[Aurora, Illinois]] on Halloween in 1934, although not by the term &quot;trick-or-treating.&quot; &quot;Front Views and Profiles&quot; (column), ''Chicago Tribune'', 3 November 1934, p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt; and the first use in a national publication occurring in 1939.&lt;ref&gt;Moss, Doris Hudson. &quot;A Victim of the Window-Soaping Brigade?&quot; ''The American Home'', November 1939, p. 48.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Halloween Trunk-or-Treat.jpg|thumb|An [[trunk (automobile)|automobile trunk]] at a trunk-or-treat event at St. John Lutheran Church and Early Learning Center in [[Darien, Illinois]]]]
A popular variant of trick-or-treating, known as trunk-or-treating (or Halloween tailgaiting), occurs when &quot;children are offered treats from the trunks of cars parked in a church parking lot,&quot; or sometimes, a school parking lot.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Halloween Encyclopedia page 9&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Bluff Park'' (Heather Jones Skaggs), Arcadia Publishing, page 117&lt;/ref&gt; In a trunk-or-treat event, the [[trunk (automobile)|trunk]] (boot) of each automobile is decorated with a certain theme,&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Trunk-or-Treat&quot;, ''The Chicago Tribune''&lt;/ref&gt; such as those of [[children's literature]], movies, [[Bible|scripture]], and [[Job (role)|job roles]].&lt;ref&gt;''Suggested Themes for “Trunks” for Trunk or Treat'' (Dail R. Faircloth), First Baptist Church of Royal Palm Beach&lt;/ref&gt; Trunk-or-treating has grown in popularity due to its perception as being more safe than going door to door, a point that resonates well with parents, as well as the fact that it &quot;solves the rural conundrum in which homes [are] built a half-mile apart&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Trunk or Treat focuses on fun, children's safety&quot;, ''Desert Valley Times''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Trunk or Treat!

===Costumes===
{{Main| Halloween costume}}
[[File:Vintage Halloween Costumes.jpg|thumb|right|300px|A [[costume party]] in 1890]]

Halloween costumes are traditionally modeled after supernatural figures such as vampires, monsters, ghosts, skeletons, witches, and devils. Over time, in the United States the costume selection extended to include popular characters from fiction, celebrities, and generic [[archetypes]] such as ninjas and princesses.&lt;ref name=Britannica /&gt;

Dressing up in costumes and going &quot;guising&quot; was prevalent in Ireland and Scotland at Halloween by the late 19th century.&lt;ref name=frle/&gt; Costuming became popular for Halloween parties in the US in the early 20th century, as often for adults as for children. The first mass-produced Halloween costumes appeared in stores in the 1930s when [[trick-or-treating]] was becoming popular in the United States.

The yearly [[Greenwich Village Halloween Parade|New York Halloween Parade]], begun in 1974 by [[puppeteer]] and mask maker Ralph Lee of [[Greenwich Village]], is the world's largest Halloween parade and one of America's only major nighttime parades (along with Portland's Starlight Parade), attracting more than 60,000 costumed participants, two million spectators, and a worldwide television audience of over 100 million.&lt;ref name=&quot;NYCHalloweenParade&quot;/&gt;

Eddie J. Smith, in his book ''Halloween, Hallowed is Thy Name'', offers a religious perspective to the wearing of costumes on All Hallows' Eve, suggesting that by dressing up as creatures &quot;who at one time caused us to fear and tremble&quot;, people are able to poke fun at [[Satan]] &quot;whose kingdom has been plundered by our Saviour.&quot; Images of skeletons and the dead are traditional decorations used as ''[[memento mori]]''.&lt;ref&gt;''School Year, Church Year'' (Peter Mazar), Liturgy Training Publications, page 114&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Memento Mori'', Museum of Art and Archaeology, University of Missouri&lt;/ref&gt;

===UNICEF===
{{Main|Trick-or-Treat for UNICEF}}

&quot;Trick-or-Treat for [[United Nations Children's Fund|UNICEF]]&quot; is a fundraising program to support UNICEF,&lt;ref name=Britannica /&gt; a United Nations Programme that provides humanitarian aid to children in developing countries. Started as a local event in a Northeast [[Philadelphia]] neighborhood in 1950 and expanded nationally in 1952, the program involves the distribution of small boxes by schools (or in modern times, corporate sponsors like [[Hallmark Cards|Hallmark]], at their licensed stores) to trick-or-treaters, in which they can solicit small-change donations from the houses they visit. It is estimated that children have collected more than $118&amp;nbsp;million for UNICEF since its inception. In Canada, in 2006, UNICEF decided to discontinue their Halloween collection boxes, citing safety and administrative concerns; after consultation with schools, they instead redesigned the program.&lt;ref name=&quot;ctv&quot;&gt;{{cite news |first=Genevieve |last=Beauchemin |author2=CTV.ca News Staff |title=UNICEF to end Halloween 'orange box' program |url= http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/20060530/unicef_orange_060530?s_name=&amp;no_ads= |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20071016235444/http://ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/20060530/unicef_orange_060530?s_name=&amp;no_ads= |archivedate= 16 October 2007 |publisher=CTV |date=31 May 2006 |accessdate=29 October 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ca_un&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=History of the Trick-or-Treat for UNICEF Campaign |url =http://www.trickortreatforunicef.ca/tot_history.html |archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20090604032837/http://www.trickortreatforunicef.ca/tot_history.html |archivedate =4 June 2009 |publisher=UNICEF Canada |year=2008 |accessdate=25 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Games and other activities==
[[File:Halloween-card-mirror-2.jpg|upright|left|thumb|In this 1904 Halloween greeting card, [[divination]] is depicted: the young woman looking into a mirror in a darkened room hopes to catch a glimpse of her future husband.]]

There are several games traditionally associated with Halloween parties. One common game is dunking or [[apple bobbing]], which may be called &quot;dooking&quot; in Scotland&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/scotland/south_of_scotland/7648188.stm Apple dookers make record attempt]&quot;, BBC News, 2 October 2008&lt;/ref&gt; in which apples float in a tub or a large basin of water and the participants must use their teeth to remove an apple from the basin. The practice is thought by some to have derived from the Roman practices in celebration of [[Pomona (mythology)|Pomona]].&lt;ref name=Britannica /&gt; A variant of dunking involves kneeling on a chair, holding a fork between the teeth and trying to drive the fork into an apple. Another common game involves hanging up treacle or syrup-coated scones by strings; these must be eaten without using hands while they remain attached to the string, an activity that inevitably leads to a very sticky face.

Some games traditionally played at Halloween are forms of divination. In All Hallows' Eve celebrations during the [[Middle Ages]], these activities historically occurred only in rural areas of medieval Europe and were only done by a &quot;rare few&quot; as these were considered to be &quot;deadly serious&quot; practices.&lt;ref name=&quot;Medieval Celebrations page 17&quot;/&gt; A traditional Scottish form of divining one's future spouse is to carve an apple in one long strip, then toss the peel over one's shoulder. The peel is believed to land in the shape of the first letter of the future spouse's name.&lt;ref name=&quot;McNeill&quot;&gt;McNeill, F. Marian (1961, 1990) ''The Silver Bough'', Vol. 3. William MacLellan, Glasgow ISBN 0-948474-04-1 pp.11–46&lt;/ref&gt; Unmarried women were told that if they sat in a darkened room and gazed into a mirror on Halloween night, the face of their future husband would appear in the mirror.&lt;ref name=&quot;hollister&quot;&gt;{{cite book

The custom was widespread enough to be commemorated on greeting cards&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vintageholidaycrafts.com/vintage-halloween-women/ |title=Vintage Halloween Cards |publisher=Vintage Holiday Crafts |accessdate=28 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; from the late 19th century and early 20th century.

[[File:Families picking pumpkins for Halloween.PNG|thumb|A common custom includes picking and purchasing pumpkins from [[Garden|patch]]es]]

Another game/superstition that was enjoyed in the early 1900s involved walnut shells. People would write fortunes in milk on white paper. After drying, the paper was folded and placed in walnut shells. When the shell was warmed, milk would turn brown therefore the writing would appear on what looked like blank paper. Folks would also play fortune teller. In order to play this game, symbols were cut out of paper and placed on a platter. Someone would enter a dark room and was ordered to put her hand on a piece of ice then lay it on a platter. Her &quot;fortune&quot; would stick to the hand. Paper symbols included: dollar sign-wealth, button-bachelorhood, thimble-spinsterhood, clothespin- poverty, rice-wedding, umbrella- journey, caldron-trouble, 4-leaf clover- good luck, penny-fortune, ring-early marriage, and key-fame.&lt;ref&gt;''Green Bay Press Gazette'', 27 October 1916&lt;/ref&gt;

The telling of [[ghost story|ghost stories]] and viewing of horror films are common fixtures of Halloween parties. Episodes of television series and [[List of Halloween television specials|Hallowe'en-themed specials]] (with the specials usually aimed at children) are commonly aired on or before Halloween, while new horror films are often released theatrically before Halloween to take advantage of the atmosphere.

==Haunted attractions==
[[File:Ura and ima.jpg|thumb|Humorous [[tombstone]]s in front of a house in [[California]]]]

{{Main|Haunted attraction (simulated)}}
Haunted attractions are entertainment venues designed to thrill and scare patrons. Most attractions are seasonal Halloween businesses. Origins of these paid scare venues are difficult to pinpoint, but it is generally accepted that they were first commonly used by the [[Junior Chamber International]] (Jaycees) for fundraising.&lt;ref name=&quot;msnbc&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/9855272/|title=Haunted house business getting frightfully hard|last=Associated Press|date=30 October 2005|work=MSNBC.com|publisher=MSNBC|accessdate=18 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; They include [[haunted houses]], [[corn maze]]s, and [[hayride]]s,&lt;ref name=&quot;hvmag&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hvmag.com/Hudson-Valley-Magazine/October-2008/A-Model-of-Mayhem/ |title=A Model of Mayhem |accessdate=6 October 2008 |author=Greg Ryan |date=17 September 2008 |work=Hudson Valley Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the level of sophistication of the effects has risen as the industry has grown. Haunted attractions in the United States bring in an estimated $300–500 million each year, and draw some 400,000 customers, although press sources writing in 2005 speculated that the industry had reached its peak at that time.&lt;ref name=&quot;msnbc&quot;/&gt; This maturing and growth within the industry has led to technically more advanced [[special effects]] and costuming, comparable with that of [[Hollywood]] films.&lt;ref name=&quot;usatoday-haunt&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/life/lifestyle/2006-10-11-haunted-house-main_x.htm |title=Haunted houses get really scary|last=Wilson|first=Craig|date=12 October 2006 |work=USAToday.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Food==
[[File:HalloweenPumpkin2.jpg|thumb|left|Pumpkins for sale during Halloween]]

On All Hallows' Eve, many Western Christian denominations encourage [[meat-free day|abstinence from meat]], giving rise to a variety of [[Christian vegetarianism|vegetarian]] foods associated with this day.&lt;ref name=mader&gt;{{cite web |last=Mader |first=Isabel |date=September 30, 2014 |title=Halloween Colcannon |publisher=Simmer Magazine |url=http://www.simmermagazine.com/2014/09/30/halloween-colcannon-recipe/ |accessdate=3 October 2014 |quote=All Hallow's Eve was a Western (Anglo) Christian holiday that revolved around commemorating the dead using humor to intimidate death itself. Like all holidays, All Hallow's Eve involved traditional treats. The church encouraged an abstinence from meat, which created many vegetarian dishes.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because in the [[Northern Hemisphere]] Halloween comes in the wake of the yearly apple harvest, [[candy apple]]s (known as toffee apples outside North America), [[Caramel apple|caramel or taffy apples]] are common Halloween treats made by rolling whole apples in a sticky sugar syrup, sometimes followed by rolling them in nuts.

At one time, candy apples were commonly given to trick-or-treating children, but the practice rapidly waned in the wake of widespread rumors that some individuals were embedding items like pins and [[Poisoned candy myths|razor blades in the apples]] in the United States.&lt;ref name=&quot;rogers_r&quot;&gt;Rogers, Nicholas (2002). &quot;Razor in the Apple: Struggle for Safe and Sane Halloween, ''c''. 1920–1990,&quot; ''Halloween: From Pagan Ritual to Party Night'', pp. 78–102. New York: Oxford University Press. ISBN 0-19-516896-8.&lt;/ref&gt; While there is evidence of such incidents,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.snopes.com/horrors/mayhem/needles.asp |title=Urban Legends Reference Pages: Pins and Needles in Halloween Candy |publisher=Snopes.com |accessdate=31 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; relative to the degree of reporting of such cases, actual cases involving malicious acts are extremely rare and have never resulted in serious injury. Nonetheless, many parents assumed that such heinous practices were rampant because of the mass media. At the peak of the hysteria, some hospitals offered free X-rays of children's Halloween hauls in order to find evidence of tampering. Virtually all of the few known candy poisoning incidents involved parents who poisoned their own children's candy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.livescience.com/8839-poisoned-halloween-candy-trick-treat-myth.html |title=Poisoned Halloween Candy: Trick, Treat or Myth? – LiveScience|last=Nixon|first=Robin|date=27 October 2010 |publisher=LiveScience.com |accessdate=23 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One custom that persists in modern-day [[Ireland]] is the baking (or more often nowadays, the purchase) of a [[barmbrack]] ({{lang-gle|báirín breac}}), which is a light fruitcake, into which a plain ring, a coin and other charms are placed before baking. It is said that those who get a ring will find their true love in the ensuing year. This is similar to the tradition of [[king cake]] at the festival of [[Epiphany (holiday)|Epiphany]].

List of foods associated with Halloween:
* [[Barmbrack]] ([[Ireland]])
* [[Bonfire toffee]] ([[Great Britain]])
* [[Candy apple]]s/[[toffee apple]]s (Great Britain and Ireland)
* [[Candy apple]]s, [[Candy corn]], [[candy pumpkin]]s (North America)

* [[Halloween cake]]
* Novelty candy shaped like skulls, [[Candy pumpkin|pumpkins]], bats, worms, etc.

To these Christians, Halloween holds no threat to the spiritual lives of children: being taught about death and mortality, and the ways of the Celtic ancestors actually being a valuable life lesson and a part of many of their parishioners' heritage.&lt;ref name=&quot;CelticChristians&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url = http://allsaintsbrookline.org/celtic/samhain.html | title = Feast of Samhain/Celtic New Year/Celebration of All Celtic Saints 1 November | accessdate =22 November 2006 | date = n.d. | publisher = All Saints Parish}}&lt;/ref&gt; Christian minister Sam Portaro wrote that Halloween is about using &quot;humor and ridicule to confront the power of death&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Portaro|first=Sam |title=A Companion to the Lesser Feasts and Fasts|date=25 January 1998|publisher=[[Cowley Publications]]|isbn=1461660513|page=199|quote=All Saints' Day is the centerpiece of an autumn triduum.

==Analogous celebrations and perspectives==
===Judaism===
According to [[Alfred J. Kolatch]] in the ''Second Jewish Book of Why'', in [[Judaism]], Halloween is not permitted by Jewish [[Halakha]] because it violates [[Leviticus 18|Leviticus 18:3]] which forbids Jews from partaking in gentile customs. Many Jews observe [[Bereavement in Judaism#Yizkor|Yizkor]], which is equivalent to the observance of [[Allhallowtide]] in Christianity, as prayers are said for both &quot;martyrs and for one's own family.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''The Jewish Life Cycle: rites of passage from biblical to modern times'' (Ivan G. Marcus), University of Washington Press, page 232&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, many American Jews celebrate Halloween, disconnected from its Christian origins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Judaism/Halloween.html |title=Jews and Halloween |publisher=Jewishvirtuallibrary.org |accessdate=5 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Reform Judaism|Reform]] [[Rabbi]] Jeffrey Goldwasser has said that &quot;There is no religious reason why contemporary Jews should not celebrate Halloween&quot; while [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]] Rabbi Michael Broyde has argued against Jews observing the holiday.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://haamnews.wordpress.com/2011/10/30/halloween-and-judaism-a-contradiction-or-a-coalition/ |title=Halloween and Judaism: a contradiction or a coalition? |publisher=Haamnews.wordpress.com |date=30 October 2011 |accessdate=5 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jews do have the [[Purim]] holiday, where they get to dress up in costumes and celebrate it.

===Islam===
[[Sheikh]] Idris Palmer, author of ''A Brief Illustrated Guide to Understanding Islam'', has argued that [[Muslim]]s should not participate in Halloween, stating that &quot;participation in Halloween is worse than participation in [[Christmas]], [[Easter]], ... it is more sinful than congratulating the Christians for their prostration to the crucifix&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://alhudainstitute.ca/Upload/specialevents/halloween/through-muslim-eyes.pdf |title=Halloween: Through Muslim Eyes |author=A.

===Hinduism===

(Wicasta Lovelace), Pagan Centric&lt;/ref&gt; and &quot;avoid Halloween, because of the interruptions from trick or treaters.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''Halloween, From a Wiccan/Neopagan perspective'' (B.A. Robinson), Ontario Consultants on Religious Tolerance&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Manitoban]]'' writes that &quot;[[Wiccans]] don’t officially celebrate Halloween, despite the fact that 31 Oct. will still have a star beside it in any good Wiccan’s day planner. Starting at sundown, Wiccans celebrate a holiday known as Samhain. Samhain actually comes from old Celtic traditions and is not exclusive to Neopagan religions like Wicca. While the traditions of this holiday originate in Celtic countries, modern day Wiccans don’t try to historically replicate Samhain celebrations. Some traditional Samhain rituals are still practised but at its core, the holiday is simply a time to celebrate darkness and the dead — a possible reason why Samhain is often confused with Halloween celebrations.&quot;&lt;ref name=George/&gt;

In Scotland and Ireland, traditional Halloween customs include children dressing up in costume going &quot;guising&quot;, holding parties, while other practices in Ireland include lighting bonfires, and having firework displays.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.u.tv/News/Halloween-fire-calls-every-90-seconds/15324334-54c7-4167-b118-40fd763bf701 Halloween fire calls 'every 90 seconds'] ''UTV News'' Retrieved 22 November 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/community-telegraph/north-down/news/halloween-firework-injuries-are-on-the-increase-hospital-14989337.html|title=Halloween firework injuries are on the increase|last=McCann|first=Chris|date=28 October 2010|publisher=Belfast Telegraph|accessdate=22 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Brittany children would play practical jokes by setting candles inside skulls in graveyards to frighten visitors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tartanplace.com/hcustom/kalan.html |title=Kalan -Goañv ha Marv |publisher=Tartanplace.com |date=12 July 2001 |accessdate=1 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mass transatlantic immigration in the 19th century popularized Halloween in North America, and celebration in the United States and Canada has had a significant impact on how the event is observed in other nations.

A '''party''' is a gathering of people who have been invited by a [[Hospitality|host]] for the purposes of [[socializing]], [[conversation]], [[recreation]], or as part of a [[festival]] or other commemoration of a special occasion. A party will typically feature [[food]] and [[beverages]], and often [[music]] and [[dancing]] or other forms of [[entertainment]]. In many Western countries, parties for teens and adults are associated with drinking alcohol such as [[beer]], [[wine]] or [[distilled spirits]]. 

== Description ==
Some parties are held in [[honor]] of a specific person, day, or event, such as a birthday party, a [[Super Bowl]] party, or a [[St. Patrick’s Day]] party. Parties of this kind are often called '''celebrations'''. A party is not necessarily a private occasion. Public parties are sometimes held in [[restaurant]]s, [[Public house|pubs]], [[beer gardens]], [[nightclub]]s or [[Bar (establishment)|bars]], and people attending such parties may be charged an admission fee by the host.  Large parties in public streets may celebrate events such as [[Mardi Gras]] or the signing of a [[peace treaty]] ending a long war.

== Types of parties ==
=== Birthday party ===
{{Redirect|Birthday party}}
[[File:Birthday candles.jpg|thumb|A [[birthday cake]] with lit novelty candles]]
[[File:Birthday party.jpg|thumb|Children at a birthday party]]
A [[birthday]] party is a celebration of the [[anniversary]] of the birth of the person who is being honored. The tradition started in the mid-nineteenth century but did not become popular until the mid-twentieth century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Korab|first=Holly|title=A Brief History of Birthday Parties|url=http://www.las.illinois.edu/alumni/magazine/articles/2001/birthday/|publisher=LAS News|accessdate=2 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Birthday parties are now a feature of many cultures.

In [[Western culture]]s, birthday parties include a number of common rituals. The guests may be asked to bring a gift for the honored person. Party locations are often decorated with colorful decorations, such as [[balloon]]s and streamers. A [[birthday cake]] is usually served with lit candles that are to be blown out after a &quot;birthday wish&quot; has been made. The person being honored will be given the first piece of cake. While the birthday cake is being brought to the table, the song &quot;[[Happy Birthday to You]]&quot; or some other birthday song is sung by the guests.

At parties for children, time is often taken for the &quot;gift opening&quot; wherein the individual whose birthday is celebrated opens each of the gifts brought. It is also common at children's parties for the host to give parting gifts to the attendees in the form of &quot;goodie bags&quot;. Children and even adults sometimes wear colorful cone-shaped [[party hat]]s.

Birthday parties are often larger and more extravagant if they celebrate someone who has reached what is regarded in the culture as a milestone age, such as transition from childhood to adulthood. Examples of traditional [[coming of age]] celebrations include the North American [[sweet sixteen (birthday)|sweet sixteen party]] and the Latin American [[quinceañera]].

=== Surprise party ===
{{Redirect|Surprise party}}
A surprise party is a party that is not made known beforehand to the person in whose honor it is being held.

Birthday surprise parties are the most common kind of surprise party.  At most such parties, the guests will arrive an hour or so before the honored person arrives. Often, a friend in on the surprise will lead the honored person to the location of the party without letting on anything.

The guests might even conceal themselves from view, and when the honored person enters the room, they leap from hiding and all shout, &quot;Surprise!&quot;  For some surprise birthday parties, it is considered to be a good tactic to shock the honored person.  Streamers, [[silly string]], and [[balloons]] may be used for this purpose. Evidence of a party, such as decorations and balloons, are not made visible from the exterior of the home, so that the honored person will suspect nothing.

=== Dinner party ===
[[File:Julbord 1990b.jpg|thumb|left|upright|A buffet (Smörgåsbord) set for a party]]

A dinner party is a social gathering at which people eat [[dinner]] together, usually in the host’s home. At the most formal dinner parties, the dinner is served on a dining table with [[Table setting|place settings]]. Dinner parties are often preceded by a [[cocktail party|cocktail hour]] in a living room or bar, where guests drink [[cocktail]]s while mingling and conversing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dinner Party|url=http://www.hgtv.com/topics/dinner-party/index.html|publisher=HGTV|accessdate=2 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Wine]] is usually served throughout the meal, often with a different wine accompanying each course.

At less formal dinner parties, a [[buffet]] is provided. Guests choose food from the buffet and eat while standing up and conversing.  Women guests may wear [[cocktail dress]]es; men may  wear [[blazer]]s.

At some informal dinner parties, the host may ask guests to bring food or [[Drink|beverages]] (a [[Main course|main dish]], a [[side dish]], a [[dessert]], or [[Hors d'œuvre|appetizer]]s). A party of this type is called a [[potluck]] or potluck dinner. In the United States, potlucks are very often held in churches and community centers.

=== Garden party ===
A garden party is a party in a [[park]] or a [[garden]]. An event described as a garden party is usually more formal than other outdoor gatherings, which may be called simply parties, [[picnic]]s, [[barbecue]]s, etc. A garden party can be a prestigious event. For example, invitations by the [[British Sovereign]] to [[Garden_at_Buckingham_Palace#Garden parties|garden parties at Buckingham Palace]] are considered an honor. The President of France holds a garden party at the [[Palais de l'Elysée]] in Paris on [[Bastille Day]].

=== Cocktail party ===
{{Main|Cocktail party}}
A cocktail party is a party at which [[cocktail]]s are served. It is sometimes called a &quot;cocktail reception&quot;. Women who attend a cocktail party may wear a [[cocktail dress]]. A [[cocktail hat]] is sometimes worn as a fashion statement.

=== Tea party ===
[[File:StateLibQld 1 137422 Tea party in the garden, possibly at Nanango, 1900-1910.jpg|thumb|An outdoor tea party in Australia (between 1900 and 1910)]]
{{Main|Tea party (social gathering)}}
In Anglo-American culture, a [[tea]] party is a formal gathering for [[Tea (meal)#Afternoon tea|afternoon tea]]. These parties were traditionally attended only by women, but men may also be invited. Tea parties are often characterized by the use of prestigious [[tableware]], such as [[bone china]] and  [[silver (household)|silver]]. The table, whatever its size or cost, is made to look its prettiest, with cloth napkins and matching cups and plates.

In addition to tea, larger parties may serve punch or, in cold weather, hot chocolate. The tea is accompanied by a variety of easily managed foods. Thin [[sandwich]]es such as [[Cucumber sandwich|cucumber]] or tomato, [[banana]]s, [[cake|cake slices]], [[buns]], and [[cookies]] are all common choices.

=== Reception ===
[[File:Rochester Contemporary Art Center Opening Reception.jpg|thumb|Reception at an art exhibition opening]]
Formal receptions are parties that are designed to receive a large number of guests, often at prestigious venues such as [[Buckingham Palace]], the [[White House]] or [[Government Houses of the British Empire and Commonwealth]]. The hosts and any guests of honor form a [[Wedding reception#Receiving line|receiving line]] in [[order of precedence]] near the entrance. Each guest is announced to the host who greets each one in turn as he or she arrives.  Each guest properly speaks little more than his name (if necessary) and a conventional greeting or congratulation to each person in the receiving line. In this way, the line of guests progresses steadily without unnecessary delay. After formally receiving each guest in this fashion, the hosts may mingle with the guests.

Somewhat less formal receptions are common in academic settings, sometimes to honor a [[guest speaker|guest lecturer]], or to celebrate a special occasion such as retirement of a respected member of staff. Receptions are also common in [[symposium]] or [[academic conference]] settings, as an environment for attendees to mingle and interact informally.  These gatherings may be accompanied by a sit-down dinner, or more commonly, a stand-up informal [[buffet]] meal.

Receptions are also held to celebrate [[art exhibition|exhibition opening]]s at [[art gallery|art galleries]] or [[museum]]s.  The featured artist or artists are often present, as well as the [[curator]]s who organized the exhibition. In addition or instead, a celebratory reception may be held partway through or at the end of an exhibition run.  This alternative scheduling allows guests more time to see the exhibition in depth at their own pace, before meeting the featured guests.  Some food is often served, as in academic gatherings.

Refreshments at a reception may be as minimal, such as coffee or lemonade, or as elaborate as those at a [[state dinner]].

=== Dances and balls ===
[[File:Assyrianfolkdance.jpg|thumb|260px|right|[[Folk dance]] in an [[Assyrian people|Assyrian]] party, [[Chicago]], USA.]]
{{Main|Dance party}}
A dance is a social gathering at which the guests dance. It may be a casual, informal affair or a structured event, such as a [[Prom|school dance]] or a charity ball. Dances usually take place during the evening. An afternoon dance is formally known as a [[tea dance]]. Some dances feature specific kinds of dancing, such as [[Square dance|square dancing]].

A [[Ball (dance)|ball]] is a large formal party that features [[Ballroom dance|ballroom dancing]]. Women guests wear [[ball gown]]s; men wear [[White tie|evening dress]].

=== Block party ===
{{Main|Block party|Street party}}
A block party is a public party that is attended by the residents of a specific city block or neighborhood. These parties are typically held in a city street that has been closed to traffic to accommodate the party. At some block parties, attendees are free to pass from house to house, socializing, and often drinking [[alcoholic beverages]].

=== Costume or fancy dress party ===
At a [[masquerade ball]], guests wear [[mask]]s to conceal their identities. Guests at a [[costume party]] or a fancy dress party wear costumes. These parties are sometimes associated with holiday events, such as [[Halloween]] and [[Mardi Gras]].

=== Christmas caroling party ===
In [[England|English]] and [[United States|American]] culture during the [[Christmas]] season, it is traditional to have a Christmas caroling party. People go from door to door in a neighborhood and sing [[Christmas carol]]s. Some popular Christmas carols are &quot;[[We Wish You a Merry Christmas]]&quot;, &quot;[[Deck the Halls]]&quot;, &quot;[[The Twelve Days of Christmas (song)|The Twelve Days of Christmas]]&quot;, &quot;[[Frosty the Snowman]]&quot;, &quot;[[Jingle Bells]]&quot;, &quot;[[Silver Bells]]&quot;, &quot;[[Santa Claus Is Coming to Town]]&quot;, and &quot;[[O Holy Night]]&quot;.

In Spain, this type of party is called ''El Aguinaldo''. It is the same as in England and the United States, but the only difference is that the children who sing the carols are given tips.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.merriam-webster.com/spanish/aguinaldo|title= aguinaldo
|publisher=Merriam-Webster|accessdate=2012-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Christmas songs are called ''villancios'' in Spain; they are mainly sung by children at small parties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.donquijote.org/spanishlanguage/lyrics/xmas/|title= don Quijote |publisher=don Quijote|accessdate=2012-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Parties for teenagers and young adults ===
[[File:The Adicts 2011 SO36 03.jpg|thumb|A [[dance party]] supported by a live [[Musical ensemble|band]] ([[SO36]], [[Berlin]])]]
[[Dance party|Dance parties]] are gatherings in bars or community centers where the guests dance to [[house music]], [[Techno|techno music]], or [[disco]]. The music for dance parties is usually selected and played by a [[disc jockey]].

A spin-off of dance parties, the [[rave]] involves dancing to loud  [[house music]], [[Techno|techno music]], or [[industrial music]]. Rave parties may be attended by as few as a score of people in a basement or, more likely, by a few hundred people in a club, to as many as thousands in a large warehouse, field, or even tens of thousands in a sporting arena, amusement park, or other large space. Raves are associated with illegal drugs such as [[Ecstasy (drug)|Ecstasy]] and [[psychedelic drugs]].

A [[house party]] is a party where a large group of people get together at a private home to socialize. House parties that involve the drinking of beer pumped from a [[keg]] are called keg parties or “keggers.” These parties are popular in [[North America]], the [[United Kingdom]], and [[Australia]] and are often attended by people under the [[legal drinking age]]. Sometimes, even older party-goers run afoul of the law for having provided [[alcoholic beverage]]s to [[Minor (law)|minors]]. Arrests may also be made for violating a [[noise]] ordinance, for [[disorderly conduct]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.post-gazette.com/regionstate/20011104beertag1104p6.asp Law would tag beer kegs to fight use by the young] “While it affects all adults who buy kegs, the proposed law is aimed at the 21-to-23-year-old crowd, particularly college students, who don’t think twice about buying a keg or 10 for a weekend bash. Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, 2001-11-04.&lt;/ref&gt; and even  for operating a “[[Speakeasy|blind pig]]”, an establishment that illegally sells alcoholic beverages.

Outdoor parties include bush parties and beach parties. Bush parties (also called “field parties”) are held in a secluded area of a forest (“bush”), where friends gather to [[Drinking#Alcoholic beverages|drink]] and talk. These parties are often held around a [[bonfire]]. Beach parties are held on a sandy shoreline of a lake, river, or sea, and also often feature a bonfire.

A pool party is a party in which the guests swim in a [[swimming pool]].

School-related parties for teenagers and young adults include [[prom]]s and [[Graduation|graduation parties]], which are held in honor of someone who has recently graduated from a school or university.

=== Singles dance party and mixer ===
A singles dance party and mixer is a party which is organized for people who are not married and who want to find a partner for [[friendship]], [[dating]], or [[Sexual intercourse|sex]].

Usually a “mixer game” is played, to make it easy for people to meet each other. For example, each guest may be given a card with an inspiring quotation on it. The game is to find someone of the opposite sex who has the same quotation. Couples who have matching cards may be given a small prize.

These parties are sponsored by various organizations, both non-profit and for-profit.

=== Fundraising party ===
A fundraising party, or fundraiser, is a party that is held for the purpose of collecting money that will be given to some person or to some institution, such as a [[school]], [[Charitable organization|charity]], [[business]], or  [[political campaign]]. These parties are usually formal and consist of a dinner followed by speeches or by a presentation extolling whatever the money is being raised for.

It is very common to charge an admission fee for parties of this kind. This fee may be as high as several thousand dollars, especially if money is being raised for a [[political campaign]].

=== Graduation party ===
In some places, parties to celebrate graduation from school, college or university are popular.

=== Marriage-related parties ===

=== Showers ===
{{See also|Bridal shower|Baby shower}}
A shower is a party whose primary purpose is to give gifts to the [[guest of honor]], commonly a [[bride-to-be]] or a mother-to-be.  Guests who attend are expected to bring a small gift, usually related to the upcoming life event, like getting married or having a baby. Themed games are a frequent sight during showers as well.

=== Housewarming party ===
{{Main|Housewarming party}}
A housewarming party may be held when a family, couple, or person moves into a new house or apartment. It is an occasion for the hosts to show their new home to their friends. Housewarming parties are typically informal and do not include any planned activities other than a tour of the new house or apartment. Invited family members and friends may bring gifts for the new home.

=== Welcome party ===
A welcome party is held for the purpose of welcoming a newcomer, such as a new club member, a new employee, or a family's new baby.

=== Farewell party ===
In many cultures, it is customary to throw a farewell party in honor of someone who is moving away or departing on a long trip (sometimes called a ''bon voyage'' party).  Retirement parties for departing co-workers fall into this category.

=== Cast party ===
A cast party is a celebration following the final performance of a theatric event, such as a [[Play (theatre)|play]], a [[Musical theatre|musical]], or an  [[opera]]. A party of this kind may also be held following the end of shooting for a [[Film|motion picture]] (called a “wrap party”) or after the season’s final episode of a [[Television program|television series]]. Cast parties are traditionally held for most theater performances, both professional and amateur.

Invited guests are usually restricted to performers, crew members, and a few others who did not participate in the performance, such as sponsors and donors who have helped fund the production.

=== Pre-party ===
A pre-party is a party that is held immediately before some event, such as a  [[Partner dance|school dance]], a [[wedding]], a birthday party, or a [[bar mitzvah]]. These parties are usually of short duration and sometimes involve getting ready  for the event (e.g., the guests may put on makeup or costumes). Guests usually leave at the same time and arrive at the event together.

=== After-party ===
{{redirect|Afterparty|Cool Kids of Death album|Afterparty (album)}}
An after-party is a party that is held after a musical or theatrical performance or after some other event, such as a [[wedding]] or a [[Dance party#School dances|school dance]]. Guests are usually limited to friends of the host.

A '''pub''' {{IPAc-en|p|ʌ|b}}, or '''public house''', is a house licensed to sell alcohol to the general public. It is a [[drinking establishment]] in [[British culture|Britain]],&lt;ref name=&quot;EB&quot;&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/482410/public-house Public House] Britannica.com; Subscription Required.

Retrieved 24 April 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; In many places, especially in villages, a pub is the focal point of the community. [[Samuel Pepys]] described the pub as the heart of [[England]].

Pubs can be traced back to Roman [[tavern]]s,&lt;ref name=&quot;Great British Pub&quot;/&gt; through the [[Anglo-Saxon]] [[alehouse]] to the development of the [[tied house]] system in the 19th century.

Pubs are socially and culturally distinct from cafés, [[Bar (establishment)|bars]] and [[beer hall]]s. Most offer a range of beers, wines, [[liquor|spirits]], and [[soft drinks]] and [[snacks]]. Traditionally the windows of town pubs were of smoked or frosted glass to obscure the clientele from the street but there has been a move towards clear glass and brighter interiors.

The owner, tenant or manager (licensee) is known as the pub landlord. Referred to as their &quot;local&quot; by regulars, pubs are typically chosen for their proximity to home or work, the availability of a particular beer, a [[darts]] team, or a [[billiards|pool]] or [[snooker]] table.

Until the 1970s most of the larger pubs also featured an off-sales counter or attached shop for the sales of beers, wines and spirits for home consumption. In the 1970s, supermarkets and high street [[chain store]]s and [[off-licence]]s undercut pub prices and all but a handful closed their off-sale counters.

==Origins==
The inhabitants of the [[British Isles]] have been drinking ale since the [[Bronze Age]], but it was with the arrival of the [[Roman Empire]] in its shores in the 1st Century, and the construction of the [[Roman road]] networks that the first inns, called [[taberna]]e,&lt;ref name=&quot;Great British Pub&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.historic-uk.com/cultureUk/greatBritishpub.htm | title = Great British Pub}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which travellers could obtain refreshment began to appear. After the departure of Roman authority in the 5th Century and the fall of the Romano-British kingdoms, the [[Anglo-Saxons]] established alehouses that grew out of domestic dwellings, the Anglo-Saxon [[Alewife (trade)|alewife]] would put a green bush up on a pole to let people know her brew was ready.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.pubsquiz.co.uk/articles/pubhistory.asp | title = The history of the pub}}&lt;/ref&gt; These alehouses quickly evolved into meeting houses for the folk to socially congregate, gossip and arrange mutual help within their communities. Herein lies the origin of the modern public house, or &quot;Pub&quot; as it is colloquially called in England. They rapidly spread across the [[England|Kingdom]], becoming so commonplace that in 965 [[Edgar of England|King Edgar]] decreed that there should be no more than one alehouse per village.

A traveller in the early [[Middle Ages]] could obtain overnight accommodation in monasteries, but later a demand for hostelries grew with the popularity of [[pilgrimage]]s and travel. The Hostellers of London were granted [[guild]] status in 1446 and in 1514 the guild became the [[Worshipful Company of Innholders]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.innholders.co.uk/1200-1500/asp?pagename=company%history |title=Company History |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090525004458/http://www.innholders.co.uk/1200-1500/asp?pagename=company%history |archivedate=25 May 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Inns===
{{Main|Inn}}
[[File:Jan Steen Peasants before an Inn.jpg|thumb|''Peasants before an Inn'' by Dutch artist [[Jan Steen]] c. 1653]]
'''Inns''' are buildings where travellers can seek [[lodging]] and, usually, food and drink. They are typically located in the country or along a highway. In Europe, they possibly first sprang up when the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] built a system of [[Roman road|roads]] two [[millennia]] ago.{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}} Some inns in Europe are several [[century|centuries]] old. In addition to providing for the needs of travellers, inns traditionally acted as community gathering places.

In Europe, it is the provision of accommodation,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pub-rooms.co.uk/ Pub Rooms, pub accommodation].&lt;/ref&gt; if anything, that now distinguishes inns from [[tavern]]s, [[alehouse]]s and pubs. The latter tend to provide alcohol (and, in the UK, soft drinks and often food), but less commonly accommodation. Inns tend to be older and grander establishments: historically they provided not only food and lodging, but also [[Stable|stabling]] and [[fodder]] for the traveller's horse(s) and on some roads fresh horses for the [[mail coach]]. Famous London inns include [[The George, Southwark]] and [[The Tabard]]. There is however no longer a formal distinction between an inn and other kinds of establishment. Many pubs use &quot;Inn&quot; in their name, either because they are long established former [[coaching inn]]s, or to summon up a particular kind of image, or in many cases simply as a [[pun]] on the word &quot;in&quot;, as in &quot;The Welcome Inn&quot;, the name of many pubs in Scotland.

The original services of an inn are now also available at other establishments, such as hotels, lodges, and [[motel]]s, which focus more on lodging customers than on other services, although they usually provide meals; pubs, which are primarily alcohol-serving establishments; and restaurants and taverns, which serve food and drink. In North America, the lodging aspect of the word &quot;'''inn'''&quot; lives on in hotel brand names like [[Holiday Inn]], and in some state laws that refer to lodging operators as innkeepers.

The [[Inns of Court]] and [[Inns of Chancery]] in London started as ordinary inns where [[barrister]]s met to do business, but became institutions of the [[legal profession]] in [[England and Wales]].

===Beer Houses and the 1830 Beer Act===
{{Main|Beerhouse Act 1830}}

Traditional English [[ale]] was made solely from fermented [[malt]]. The practice of adding [[hops]] to produce beer was introduced from the Netherlands in the early 15th century. Alehouses would each brew their own distinctive ale, but independent breweries began to appear in the late 17th century. By the end of the century almost all beer was brewed by commercial breweries.

The 18th century saw a huge growth in the number of drinking establishments, primarily due to the introduction of [[gin]]. Gin was brought to England by the Dutch after the [[Glorious Revolution]] of 1688 and became very popular after the government created a market for &quot;cuckoo grain&quot; or &quot;cuckoo malt&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite work|publisher=A&amp;C Black|last=Clark|first=Christine|date=1998|page=4|title=The British Malting Industry since 1830|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FP3ESHC10OMC&amp;pg=PA4&amp;lpg=PA4&amp;dq=1830+Beer+Act+grain&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=-pVAZt-D9i&amp;sig=G2-1wh2lSYVtb2r8MQc5Djd6-W8&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=fZjyUqK7F4qB7QaMiYDAAQ&amp;ved=0CEQQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=1830%20Beer%20Act%20grain&amp;f=false|accessdate=7 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; that was unfit to be used in brewing and distilling by allowing unlicensed gin and beer production, while imposing a heavy [[duty (economics)|duty]] on all imported spirits. As thousands of gin-shops sprang up all over England, brewers fought back by increasing the number of alehouses. By 1740 the production of gin had increased to six times that of beer and because of its cheapness it became popular with the poor, leading to the so-called [[Gin Craze]]. Over half of the 15,000 drinking establishments in London were gin shops.

The drunkenness and lawlessness created by gin was seen to lead to ruination and degradation of the working classes. The distinction{{Clarify|date=April 2012}} was illustrated by [[William Hogarth]] in his engravings [[Beer Street and Gin Lane|''Beer Street'' and ''Gin Lane'']].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/pd/w/william_hogarth,_gin_lane,_etc.aspx Gin Lane] British Museum&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Gin Act 1736]] imposed high taxes on retailers and led to riots in the streets. The prohibitive duty was gradually reduced and finally abolished in 1742. The [[Gin Act 1751]] however was more successful. It forced distillers to sell only to licensed retailers and brought gin shops under the jurisdiction of local magistrates.

By the early 19th century, encouraged by lower duties on gin, the gin houses or &quot;Gin Palaces&quot; had spread from London to most cities and towns in Britain, with most of the new establishments illegal and unlicensed. These bawdy, loud and unruly drinking dens so often described by [[Charles Dickens]] in his ''[[Sketches by Boz]]'' (published 1835–1836) increasingly came to be held as unbridled cesspits of immorality or crime and the source of much ill-health and alcoholism among the working classes.&lt;ref name=&quot;AMLWCH&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.amlwchhistory.co.uk/beer_houses.htm |title=Beer Houses |publisher=AMLWCH History |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/20071217154839/http://www.amlwchhistory.co.uk/beer_houses.htm |archivedate=17 December 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under a banner of &quot;reducing public drunkenness&quot; the Beer Act of 1830 introduced a new lower tier of premises permitted to sell alcohol, the '''Beer Houses'''. At the time beer was viewed as harmless, nutritious and even healthy. Young children were often given what was described as [[small beer]], which was brewed to have a low alcohol content, as the local water was often unsafe. Even the evangelical church and [[temperance movement in the United Kingdom|temperance movement]]s of the day viewed the drinking of beer very much as a secondary evil and a normal accompaniment to a meal. The freely available beer was thus intended to wean the drinkers off the evils of gin, or so the thinking went.&lt;ref name = &quot;UK Hist&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.history.uk.com/articles/index.php?archive=61 | title = Beer Houses | publisher = History UK}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the 1830 Act any householder who paid rates could apply, with a one-off payment of two [[Guinea (British coin)|guineas]] (roughly equal in value to £{{formatnum:{{Inflation|UK|2.10|1830|r=0}}}} today), to sell beer or [[cider]] in his home (usually the front parlour) and even to brew his own on his premises. The permission did not extend to the sale of spirits and fortified wines, and any beer house discovered selling those items was closed down and the owner heavily fined. Beer houses were not permitted to open on Sundays. The beer was usually served in jugs or dispensed directly from tapped wooden barrels on a table in the corner of the room. Often profits were so high the owners were able to buy the house next door to live in, turning every room in their former home into bars and lounges for customers.

In the first year, 400 beer houses opened and within eight years there were 46,000&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oldcannonbrewery.co.uk/5.html |title=Beer houses |publisher=Old Cannon Brewery |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070110215128/http://www.oldcannonbrewery.co.uk/5.html |archivedate=10 January 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; across the country, far outnumbering the combined total of long-established taverns, pubs, inns and hotels. Because it was so easy to obtain permission and the profits could be huge compared to the low cost of gaining permission, the number of beer houses was continuing to rise and in some towns nearly every other house in a street could be a beer house. Finally in 1869 the growth had to be checked by magisterial control and new licensing laws were introduced. Only then was it made harder to get a licence, and the licensing laws which operate today were formulated.

Although the new licensing laws prevented new beer houses from being created, those already in existence were allowed to continue and many did not close until nearly the end of the 19th century. A very small number remained into the 21st century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1209600/A-pub-parlour-Flossies-pub-room-cottage-You-let-pulled-pint-left-money-jam-jar-Now-orders-locals-crying-beer.html|title=The country's smallest pub?

These usually small establishments can still be identified in many towns, seemingly oddly located in the middle of otherwise terraced housing part way up a street, unlike purpose-built pubs that are usually found on corners or road junctions. Many of today's respected real ale micro-brewers in the UK started as home based Beer House brewers under the 1830 Act.

The beer houses tended to avoid the traditional pub names like ''The Crown'', ''The Red Lion'', ''The Royal Oak'' etc. and, if they did not simply name their place ''Smith's Beer House'', they would apply topical pub names in an effort to reflect the mood of the times.

==Licensing laws==
{{Main|Licensing laws of the United Kingdom}}
[[File:Pubbsm.jpg|thumb|The interior of a typical English pub]]
[[File:Pub-london-wikimania-ye-olde-cock-tavern.jpg|thumb|People drinking at Ye Olde Cock Tavern in London, England]]

There was already regulation on public drinking spaces in the 17th and 18th centuries,{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} and the income earned from licences was beneficial to the crown. Tavern owners were required to possess a licence to sell ale, and a separate licence for distilled spirits.

From the mid-19th century on the opening hours of licensed premises in the UK were restricted. However licensing was gradually liberalised after the 1960s, until contested licensing applications became very rare, and the remaining administrative function was transferred to Local Authorities in 2005.

The Wine and Beerhouse Act 1869 reintroduced the stricter controls of the previous century. The sale of beers, wines or spirits required a licence for the premises from the local [[magistrates]]. Further provisions regulated gaming, drunkenness, prostitution and undesirable conduct on licensed premises, enforceable by prosecution or more effectively by the landlord under threat of forfeiting his licence. Licences were only granted, transferred or renewed at special Licensing Sessions courts, and were limited to respectable individuals. Often these were ex-servicemen or ex-policemen; retiring to run a pub was popular amongst military officers at the end of their service. Licence conditions varied widely, according to local practice. They would specify permitted hours, which might require Sunday closing, or conversely permit all-night opening near a market. Typically they might require opening throughout the permitted hours, and the provision of food or lavatories. Once obtained, licences were jealously protected by the licensees (who were expected to be generally present, not an absentee owner or company), and even &quot;Occasional Licences&quot; to serve drinks at temporary premises such as fêtes would usually be granted only to existing licensees. Objections might be made by the police, rival landlords or anyone else on the grounds of infractions such as serving drunks, disorderly or dirty premises, or ignoring permitted hours.

The [[Sunday Closing (Wales) Act 1881]] required the closure of all public houses in [[Wales]] on Sundays, and was not repealed until 1961.

Detailed licensing records were kept, giving the Public House, its address, owner, licensee and misdemeanours of the licensees, often going back for hundreds of years{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}}. Many of these records survive and can be viewed, for example, at the [[London Metropolitan Archives]] centre.

The restrictions were tightened by the [[Defence of the Realm Act]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/FWWdora.htm |title=Defence of the Realm Act |publisher=Spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk |accessdate=26 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; of August 1914, which, along with the introduction of [[rationing]] and the censorship of the press for wartime purposes, restricted pubs' opening hours to 12 noon–2:30&amp;nbsp;pm and 6:30&amp;nbsp;pm–9:30&amp;nbsp;pm. Opening for the full licensed hours was compulsory, and closing time was equally firmly enforced by the police; a landlord might lose his licence for infractions. Pubs were closed under the Act and compensation paid, for example in Pembrokeshire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Awards by the Pembrokeshire Authority|work=Western Mail|date=28 September 1914|accessdate=10 August 2015|url=http://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0000104/19140928/198/0008|publisher=[[British Newspaper Archive]]|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Licensing - A Brief History|url=http://www.cambridge-camra.org.uk/ale/309/licensing-history.html|accessdate=10 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There was a special case established under the [[State Management Scheme]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.bookscumbria.com/cgi-bin/trolleyed_public.cgi?action=showprod_2886|last=Seabury|first=Olive|title=The Carlise State Management Scheme: Its Ethos and Architecture. A 60 year experiment in regulation of the liquor trade |isbn= 978-1-904147-30-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; where the brewery and licensed premises were bought and run by the state until 1973, most notably in [[Carlisle, Cumbria|Carlisle]]. During the 20th century elsewhere, both the licensing laws and enforcement were progressively relaxed, and there were differences between parishes; in the 1960s, at closing time in [[Kensington]] at 10:30&amp;nbsp;pm, drinkers would rush over the parish boundary to be in good time for &quot;Last Orders&quot; in [[Knightsbridge]] before 11&amp;nbsp;pm, a practice observed in many pubs adjoining licensing area boundaries. Some Scottish and Welsh parishes remained officially &quot;dry&quot; on Sundays (although often this merely required knocking at the back door of the pub). These restricted opening hours led to the tradition of [[#Lock-in|lock-ins]].

However, closing times were increasingly disregarded in the country pubs. In England and Wales by 2000 pubs could legally open from 11&amp;nbsp;am (12 noon on Sundays) through to 11&amp;nbsp;pm (10:30&amp;nbsp;pm on Sundays). That year was also the first to allow continuous opening for 36 hours from 11&amp;nbsp;am on New Year's Eve to 11&amp;nbsp;pm on New Year's Day. In addition, many cities had by-laws to allow some pubs to extend opening hours to midnight or 1&amp;nbsp;am, whilst [[nightclub]]s had long been granted late licences to serve alcohol into the morning. Pubs near London's [[Smithfield, London|Smithfield market]], [[Billingsgate]] [[fish market]] and [[Covent Garden]] fruit and flower market could stay open 24 hours a day since [[Victorian era|Victorian times]] to provide a service to the shift working employees of the markets.

Scotland's and [[Northern Ireland]]'s licensing laws have long been more flexible, allowing local authorities to set pub opening and closing times. In Scotland, this stemmed out of{{Clarify|date=April 2012}} a late repeal of the wartime licensing laws, which stayed in force until 1976.

The [[Licensing Act 2003]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.opsi.gov.uk/ACTS/acts2003/20030017.htm |title=Licensing Act 2003 (c. 17) |publisher=Opsi.gov.uk |date=10 July 2003 |accessdate=26 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; which came into force on 24 November 2005, consolidated the many laws into a single Act. This allowed pubs in England and Wales to apply to the local council for the opening hours of their choice. It was argued that this would end the concentration of violence around 11.30&amp;nbsp;pm, when people had to leave the pub, making policing easier. In practice, alcohol-related hospital admissions rose following the change in the law, with alcohol involved in 207,800 admissions in 2006/7.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/7414322.stm |publisher=BBC NEWS | title=Hospital alcohol admissions soar |accessdate=22 May 2008 | date=22 May 2008 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics claimed that these laws would lead to &quot;24-hour drinking&quot;. By the time the law came into effect, 60,326 establishments had applied for longer hours and 1,121 had applied for a licence to sell alcohol 24 hours a day. However nine months later many pubs had not changed their hours, although some stayed open longer at the weekend, but rarely beyond 1:00&amp;nbsp;am.

===Lock-in===
A &quot;lock-in&quot; is when a pub owner lets drinkers stay in the pub after the legal closing time, on the theory that once the doors are locked, it becomes a private party rather than a pub. Patrons may put money behind the bar before official closing time, and redeem their drinks during the lock-in so no drinks are technically sold after closing time. The origin of the British lock-in was a reaction to 1915 changes in the licensing laws in England and Wales, which curtailed opening hours to stop factory workers from turning up drunk and harming the war effort. Since 1915, the UK licensing laws had changed very little, with comparatively early closing times. The tradition of the lock-in therefore remained. Since the implementation of [[Licensing Act 2003]], premises in England and Wales may apply to extend their opening hours beyond 11&amp;nbsp;pm, allowing round-the-clock drinking and removing much of the need for lock-ins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/4457262.stm|title=R.I.P. Lock-ins|work=BBC News|accessdate=21 July 2009| date=23 November 2005 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the [[Smoking ban#United Kingdom|smoking ban]], some establishments operated a lock-in during which the remaining patrons could smoke without repercussions but, unlike drinking lock-ins, allowing smoking in a pub was still a prosecutable offence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Mike Keegan |url=http://menmedia.co.uk/manchestereveningnews/news/s/1053102_smoking_lockins_flaunt_ban |title='Smoking lock-ins' flaunt ban &amp;#124; Manchester Evening News |publisher=menmedia.co.uk |date=9 June 2008 |accessdate=4 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Indoor smoking ban==
[[File:Smoke-by-a-window-in-a-pub.jpg|thumb|upright|Tobacco smoke in a pub]]
In March 2006, a law was introduced to [[Smoking ban#United Kingdom|forbid smoking]] in all enclosed public places in Scotland.

Dundurn Press Ltd., 1992&lt;/ref&gt; The meaning of the &quot;weasel&quot; is unclear but the two most likely definitions are: a flat iron used for finishing clothing; or [[rhyming slang]] for a coat (''weasel and stoat'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ratebeer.com/Beer-News/Article-312.htm |title=Time Gentlemen Please! |publisher=Ratebeer.com |accessdate=26 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A few pubs have stage performances such as serious drama, stand-up comedy, musical bands, [[cabaret]] or [[striptease]]; however [[juke box]]es, [[karaoke]] and other forms of pre-recorded music have otherwise replaced the musical tradition of a piano or guitar and singing.{{Citation needed|date=November 2013}}

===Public bar===
By the 20th century, the saloon, or lounge bar, had become a middle-class room{{Citation needed|date=November 2013}}—carpets on the floor, [[cushions]] on the seats, and a penny or two on the prices,{{Citation needed|date=November 2013}} while the public bar, or tap room, remained working class with bare boards, sometimes with sawdust to absorb the spitting and spillages (known as &quot;spit and sawdust&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Oxford dictionaries: spit and sawdust|url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/spit-and-sawdust|accessdate=30 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;), hard bench seats, and cheap beer{{Citation needed|date=November 2013}}. This bar was known as the four-ale bar from the days when the cheapest beer served there cost 4 pence (4d) a quart.{{Citation needed|date=November 2013}}

Later, the public bars gradually improved until sometimes almost the only difference was in the prices, so that customers could choose between economy and exclusivity (or youth and age, or a [[jukebox]] or [[dartboard]]).{{Citation needed|date=November 2013}} With the blurring of class divisions in the 1960s and 1970s,{{Citation needed|date=November 2013}} the distinction between the saloon and the public bar was often seen as archaic,{{Citation needed|date=November 2013}} and was frequently abolished, usually by the removal of the dividing wall or partition.{{Citation needed|date=November 2013}} While the names of saloon and public bar may still be seen on the doors of pubs, the prices (and often the standard of furnishings and decoration) are the same throughout the premises,&lt;ref&gt;Fox, Kate (1996). ''Passport to the Pub: tourist's guide to pub etiquette'' [http://www.sirc.org/publik/ptpchap1.html]&lt;/ref&gt; and many pubs now comprise one large room. However the modern importance of dining in pubs encourages some establishments to maintain distinct rooms or areas.

===Snug===
The &quot;snug&quot;, sometimes called the ''smoke room'', was typically a small, very private room with access to the bar that had a frosted glass external window, set above head height. A higher price was paid for beer in the snug and nobody could look in and see the drinkers. It was not only the wealthy visitors who would use these rooms. The snug was for patrons who preferred not to be seen in the public bar. Ladies would often enjoy a private drink in the snug in a time when it was frowned upon for women to be in a pub. The local police officer might nip in for a quiet pint, the parish priest for his evening whisky, or lovers for a rendezvous.

[[CAMRA]] have surveyed the 50,000 pubs in Britain and they believe that there are very few pubs that still have classic snugs. These are on a historic interiors list in order that they can be preserved.&lt;ref name=snug&gt;[http://www.heritagepubs.org.uk/pubs/historic-pub-interior-entry.asp?pubid=11047 Derbyshire - Spondon, Malt Shovel], Heritagepubs, CAMRA, retrieved 27 August 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Counter===
It was the pub that first introduced the concept of the bar counter being used to serve the beer. Until that time beer establishments used to bring the beer out to the table or benches, as remains the practice in (for example) [[beer garden]]s and other drinking establishments in [[Germany]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=VJogAQAAIAAJ&amp;dq=Licensed+to+sell%3A+the+history+and+heritage+of+the+public+house&amp;q=jug#search_anchor |title=Licensed to sell: the history and heritage of the public house|page=93|author=Geoffrey K. Brandwood, Andrew Davison, Michael Slaughter|isbn=1-85074-906-X |publisher=English Heritage|year= 2004 |accessdate=15 October 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A bar might be provided for the manager to do paperwork while keeping an eye on his or her customers, but the casks of ale were kept in a separate taproom. When the first pubs were built, the main room was the public room with a large serving bar copied from the gin houses, the idea being to serve the maximum number of people in the shortest possible time. It became known as the public bar{{Citation needed|date=November 2013}}. The other, more private, rooms had no serving bar—they had the beer brought to them from the public bar. There are a number of pubs in the Midlands or the North which still retain this set up but these days the beer is fetched by the customer from the taproom or public bar. One of these is The Vine, known locally as The Bull and Bladder, in [[Brierley Hill]] near Birmingham, another the Cock at Broom, Bedfordshire a series of small rooms served drinks and food by waiting staff.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thecockatbroom.co.uk/&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Manchester]] district the public bar was known as the &quot;vault&quot;, other rooms being the lounge and snug as usual elsewhere. By the early 1970s there was a tendency to change to one large drinking room and breweries were eager to invest in interior design and theming.&lt;ref&gt;Evans, David G., et al. (1975) ''The Manchester Pub Guide, Manchester and Salford City Centres''. Manchester: Manchester Pub Surveys; pp. 1–4&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Isambard Kingdom Brunel]], the British engineer and railway builder, introduced the idea of a circular bar into the [[Swindon station]] pub in order that customers were served quickly and did not delay his trains. These island bars became popular as they also allowed staff to serve customers in several different rooms surrounding the bar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ratebeer.com/Story.asp?StoryID=312 |title=Time Gentlemen Please! |publisher=ratebeer.com |accessdate=15 October 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=X9gOXnKxdCoC&amp;pg=PA30&amp;dq=Brunel++Swindon+station#v=onepage&amp;q=Brunel%20%20Swindon%20station&amp;f=false |title=West from Paddington |author=Stuart Cole|page=30 |publisher=Etica Press Ltd|year= 2007|isbn= 1-905633-05-X |accessdate=15 October 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Beer engine===
{{Main|Beer engine}}
A &quot;beer engine&quot; is a device for [[pump]]ing beer, originally manually operated and typically used to dispense beer from a [[cask]] or container in a pub's basement or cellar.

The first beer pump known in England is believed to have been invented by John Lofting (b. Netherlands 1659-d. Great Marlow Buckinghamshire 1742) an inventor, manufacturer and merchant of London.

The London Gazette of 17 March 1691 published a patent in favour of John Lofting for a fire engine, but remarked upon and recommended another invention of his, for a beer pump:

&quot;Whereas their Majesties have been Graciously Pleased to grant Letters patent to John Lofting of London Merchant for a New Invented Engine for Extinguishing Fires which said Engine have found every great encouragement. The said Patentee hath also projected a Very Useful Engine for starting of beer and other liquors which will deliver from 20 to 30 barrels an hour which are completely fixed with Brass Joints and Screws at Reasonable Rates. Any Person that hath occasion for the said Engines may apply themselves to the Patentee at his house near St Thomas Apostle London or to Mr. Nicholas Wall at the Workshoppe near Saddlers Wells at Islington or to Mr. William Tillcar, Turner, his agent at his house in Woodtree next door to the Sun Tavern London.&quot;

&quot;Their Majesties&quot; referred to were William and Mary, who had recently arrived from the Netherlands and had been appointed joint monarchs.

A further engine was invented in the late eighteenth century by the [[locksmith]] and [[Hydraulics|hydraulic]] engineer [[Joseph Bramah]] (1748–1814).

Strictly the term refers to the pump itself, which is normally manually operated, though electrically powered and gas powered pumps are occasionally used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.camra.org.uk/page.aspx?o=180651 |title=In the Pub – CAMRA |publisher=Camra |accessdate=26 June 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110420015224/http://www.camra.org.uk/page.aspx?o=180651 |archivedate=20 April 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; When manually powered, the term &quot;handpump&quot; is often used to refer to both the pump and the associated handle.

==Pub companies==
{{unreferenced section|date=October 2010}}

{{Main|Tied house|Pub chain}}
After the development of the large London [[Porter (beer)|Porter]] breweries in the 18th century, the trend grew for pubs to become [[tied house]]s which could only sell beer from one brewery (a pub not tied in this way was called a Free house). The usual arrangement for a tied house was that the pub was owned by the brewery but rented out to a private individual (landlord) who ran it as a separate business (even though contracted to buy the beer from the brewery). Another very common arrangement was (and is) for the landlord to own the premises (whether [[Freehold (English law)|freehold]] or [[leasehold]]) independently of the brewer, but then to take a mortgage loan from a brewery, either to finance the purchase of the pub initially, or to refurbish it, and be required as a term of the loan to observe the solus tie.

A trend in the late 20th century was for breweries to run their pubs directly, using managers rather than tenants. Most such breweries, such as the [[regional brewery]] [[Shepherd Neame]] in Kent and [[Young's Brewery|Young's]] and [[Fuller's Brewery|Fuller's]] in London, control hundreds of pubs in a particular region of the UK, while a few, such as [[Greene King]], are spread nationally. The [[landlord]] of a tied pub may be an employee of the brewery—in which case he/she would be a manager of a managed house, or a self-employed tenant who has entered into a lease agreement with a brewery, a condition of which is the legal obligation (trade tie) only to purchase that brewery's beer. The beer selection is mainly limited to beers brewed by that particular [[company (law)|company]]. [[The Beer Orders]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20140402141250/http://www.competition-commission.org.uk/rep_pub/reports/1989/245beer.htm |title=The Supply of Beer |publisher=Webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk |date= |accessdate=9 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; passed in 1989, were aimed at getting tied houses to offer at least one alternative beer, known as a [[guest beer]], from another brewery. This law has now been repealed but while in force it dramatically altered the industry. Some pubs still offer a regularly changing selection of guest beers.

Organisations such as [[Wetherspoons]], [[Punch Taverns]] and O'Neill's were formed in the UK in the wake of the Beer Orders. A PubCo is a company involved in the retailing but not the manufacture of beverages, while a [[Pub chain]] may be run either by a PubCo or by a brewery.

Pubs within a chain will usually have items in common, such as fittings, promotions, ambience and range of food and drink on offer. A pub chain will position itself in the marketplace for a target audience. One company may run several pub chains aimed at different segments of the market. Pubs for use in a chain are bought and sold in large units, often from regional breweries which are then closed down. Newly acquired pubs are often renamed by the new owners, and many people resent the loss of [[traditional]] names, especially if their favourite regional beer disappears at the same time.

In 2009 about half of Britain's pubs were owned by large pub companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=BBC|title=Pubs 'face mass closure threat'|date=27 January 2009|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/mobile/wales/7853132.stm|accessdate=1 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Brewery tap===
A brewery tap is the nearest outlet for a brewery's beers. This is usually a room or bar in the brewery itself, though the name may be applied to the nearest pub. The term is not applied to a [[brewpub]] which brews and sells its beer on the same premises.

==Particular kinds of pubs==

===Country pubs===
[[File:Thatching at Ballylooby 2010.JPG|thumb|A family run pub in rural Ireland]]
[[File:The Crown Inn Chiddingfold DSC 2319.jpg|thumb|The Crown Inn Chiddingfold]]
A &quot;country pub&quot; by tradition is a rural public house. However, the distinctive culture surrounding country pubs, that of functioning as a social centre for a village and rural community, has been changing over the last thirty or so years. In the past, many rural pubs provided opportunities for country folk to meet and exchange (often local) news, while others—especially those away from village centres—existed for the general purpose, before the advent of motor transport, of serving travellers as coaching inns.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.southernlife.org.uk/country_pub.htm What the country pub is by tradition] Southern Life (UK)&lt;/ref&gt;

In more recent years, however, many country pubs have either closed down, or have been converted to establishments intent on providing seating facilities for the consumption of food, rather than a venue for members of the local community meeting and convivially drinking.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.curmudgeon.org.uk/misc/deathpub.html The more recent developments of the country pub] {{wayback|url=http://www.curmudgeon.org.uk/misc/deathpub.html |date=20081120025621 |df=y }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Theme pubs===
Pubs that cater for a niche clientele, such as sports fans or people of certain nationalities are known as '''theme pubs'''. Examples of theme pubs include sports bars, [[Rock and roll|rock]] pubs, [[biker bar|biker pub]]s, Goth pubs, [[strip pub]]s, [[karaoke bar]]s and [[Irish pub]]s.

==Signs==
{{Unreferenced section|date=May 2013}}
[[File:thegeorgesouthwarksign.jpg|thumb|upright|The pub [[signboard|sign]] of [[The George, Southwark]], depicting [[St George]] slaying a [[Dragon]]]]
In 1393 [[Richard II of England|King Richard II]] compelled landlords to erect [[signboards|signs]] outside their premises. The legislation stated &quot;Whosoever shall brew ale in the town with intention of selling it must hang out a sign, otherwise he shall forfeit his ale.&quot; This was to make alehouses easily visible to passing inspectors, [[borough]] [[ale taster]]s, who would decide the quality of the ale they provided. [[William Shakespeare]]'s father, [[John Shakespeare]], was one such inspector.

Another important factor was that during the [[Middle Ages]] a large proportion of the population would have been [[illiteracy|illiterate]] and so pictures on a sign were more useful than words as a means of identifying a public house. For this reason there was often no reason to write the establishment's name on the sign and inns opened without a formal written name, the name being derived later from the illustration on the pub's sign.

The earliest signs were often not painted but consisted, for example, of [[paraphernalia]] connected with the brewing process such as bunches of hops or brewing implements, which were suspended above the door of the pub. In some cases local nicknames, farming terms and puns were used. Local events were often commemorated in pub signs. Simple natural or religious symbols such as 'The Sun', 'The Star' and 'The Cross' were incorporated into pub signs, sometimes being adapted to incorporate elements of the [[heraldry]] (e.g. the coat of arms) of the local lords who owned the lands upon which the pub stood. Some pubs have [[Latin]] inscriptions.

Other subjects that lent themselves to visual depiction included the name of battles (e.g. [[Battle of Trafalgar|Trafalgar]]), explorers, local notables, discoveries, sporting heroes and members of the [[British Royal Family|royal family]]. Some pub signs are in the form of a pictorial pun or [[rebus]]. For example, a pub in [[Crowborough]], East Sussex called ''The Crow and Gate'' has an image of a crow with gates as wings.

A ''British Pathe News'' film of 1956 shows artist [[Michael Farrar-Bell]] at work producing inn signs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wayback.archive.org/web/20130619160632/http://www.britishpathe.com/record.php?id=595 Video of artist Michael Farrar-Bell producing inn signs] from ''British Pathe News''&lt;/ref&gt;

Most British pubs still have decorated signs hanging over their doors, and these retain their original function of enabling the identification of the pub. Today's pub signs almost always bear the name of the pub, both in words and in pictorial representation. The more remote country pubs often have stand-alone signs directing potential customers to their door.

==Names==
{{Main|Pub names}}

Pub names are used to identify and differentiate each pub. Modern names are sometimes a marketing ploy or attempt to create &quot;brand awareness&quot;, frequently using a comic theme thought to be memorable, ''Slug and Lettuce'' for a [[pub chain]] being an example. Interesting origins are not confined to old or traditional names, however. Names and their origins can be broken up into a relatively small number of categories.

As many pubs are centuries old, many of their early customers were unable to read, and pictorial signs could be readily recognised when lettering and words could not be read.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.historic-uk.com/CultureUK/PubSigns.htm |title=Culture UK – Pub and Inn Signs |publisher=Historic-uk.com |accessdate=4 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pubs often have traditional names. A common name is the &quot;Marquis of Granby&quot;. These pubs were named after [[John Manners, Marquess of Granby]], who was the son of [[John Manners, 3rd Duke of Rutland]] and a general in the 18th century [[British Army]]. He showed a great concern for the welfare of his men, and on their retirement, provided funds for many of them to establish taverns, which were subsequently named after him. All pubs granted their licence in 1780 were called the Royal George {{Citation needed|date=June 2014}}, after [[King George III]], and the twentieth anniversary of his coronation.

Many names for pubs that appear nonsensical may have come from corruptions of old slogans or phrases, such as &quot;The Bag o'Nails&quot; (Bacchanals), &quot;The Goat and Compasses&quot; (God Encompasseth Us),&lt;ref&gt;Brewer, E. Cobham (1989) ''Brewer's Dictionary of Phrase and Fable''; 14th ed., by Ivor H. Evans. London: Cassell; p. 482 where it is thought unlikely, and two other suggestions are given&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;The Cat and the Fiddle&quot; (''Chaton Fidèle'': Faithful Kitten) and &quot;The Bull and Bush&quot;, which purportedly celebrates the victory of [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] at &quot;Boulogne Bouche&quot; or [[Boulogne-sur-Mer]] Harbour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.bartleby.com/81/13751.html | author = Brewer, E.

Increasingly, more modern games such as video games and [[slot machine]]s are provided. Pubs hold special events, from [[tournament]]s of the aforementioned games to [[karaoke]] nights to [[pub quiz]]zes. Some play pop music and hip-hop (dance bar), or show [[association football|football]] and [[rugby union]] on big screen televisions (sports bar).

Some pubs in the UK also have football teams composed of regular customers. Many of these teams are in leagues that play matches on Sundays, hence the term &quot;[[Sunday League Football]]&quot;. [[Bowling]] is found in association with pubs in some parts of the country and the local team will play matches against teams invited from elsewhere on the pub's bowling green.

Pubs may be venues for [[pub song]]s and live music. During the 1970s pubs provided an outlet for a number of bands, such as [[Kilburn and the High Roads]], [[Dr. Feelgood (band)|Dr. Feelgood]] and [[The Kursaal Flyers]], who formed a musical genre called [[Pub rock (UK)|Pub rock]] that was a precursor to [[Punk music]].

==Food==

Some pubs have a long tradition of serving food, dating back to their historic usage as inns and hotels where travellers would stay.

Many pubs were drinking establishments, and little emphasis was placed on the serving of food, other than sandwiches and &quot;[[snack food|bar snacks]]&quot;, such as [[pork scratchings]], [[pickled egg]]s, salted [[Potato chips|crisps]] and peanuts which helped to increase beer sales.&lt;ref name=&quot;rememberwhen.gazettelive.co.uk&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rememberwhen.gazettelive.co.uk/2009/08/pub-grub.html |title=Nostalgia: Latest Nostalgia pieces from Gazette Live |publisher=Rememberwhen.gazettelive.co.uk |date= |accessdate=9 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[South East England]] (especially London) it was common until recent times for vendors selling [[cockle (bivalve)|cockles]], [[whelk]]s, [[mussels]], and other [[shellfish]] to sell to customers during the evening and at closing time. Many mobile shellfish stalls would set up near pubs, a practice that continues in [[London's East End]]. Otherwise, pickled cockles and mussels may be offered by the pub in jars or packets.

In the 1950s some British pubs would offer &quot;a pie and a pint&quot;, with hot individual steak and ale pies made easily on the premises by the proprietor's wife during the lunchtime opening hours.&lt;ref name=&quot;rememberwhen.gazettelive.co.uk&quot;/&gt; The [[ploughman's lunch]] became popular in the late 1960s.&lt;ref name=&quot;rememberwhen.gazettelive.co.uk&quot;/&gt; In the late 1960s &quot;chicken in a basket&quot;, a portion of roast chicken with chips, served on a napkin, in a wicker basket became popular due to its convenience.&lt;ref name=&quot;rememberwhen.gazettelive.co.uk&quot;/&gt;

Family chain pubs which served food in the evenings gained popularity in the 1970s, and included [[Berni Inn]] and [[Beefeater (restaurant)|Beefeater]].&lt;ref name=&quot;rememberwhen.gazettelive.co.uk&quot;/&gt;

Quality dropped but variety increased with the introduction of [[microwave ovens]] and [[freezer]] food. &quot;Pub grub&quot; expanded to include British food items such as [[Meat pie|steak and ale pie]], [[shepherd's pie]], [[fish and chips]], [[bangers and mash]], [[Sunday roast]], [[ploughman's lunch]], and [[Pasty|pasties]]. In addition, dishes such as [[Hamburger|burgers]], [[Buffalo Wing|chicken wings]], [[lasagne]] and [[chilli con carne]] are often served.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.brooklynpaper.com/stories/28/18/28_18spikehill2.html | title = Better Pub Grub | work = The Brooklyn Paper | first = Tina |last = Barry | date = 29 April 2005 | accessdate = 22 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | url = http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/pub-grub-gets-out-of-pickle-548350 | title = Pub grub gets out of pickle | date = 27 June 2005 | accessdate = 22 July 2013 | work = The Mirror}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some pubs offer elaborate hot and cold snacks free to customers at Sunday lunchtimes, to prevent them getting hungry and leaving for their lunch at home.

Since the 1990s food has become a more important part of a pub's trade, and today most pubs serve lunches and dinners at the table in addition to (or instead of) snacks consumed at the bar. They may have a separate dining room. Some pubs serve meals to a higher standard, to match good restaurant standards; these are sometimes termed gastropubs.

===Gastropub===

A [[gastropub]] concentrates on quality food. The name is a portmanteau of pub and [[gastronomy]] and was coined in 1991 when David Eyre and Mike Belben took over The Eagle pub in [[Clerkenwell]], London.&lt;ref&gt;

==={{anchor|Oldest}} Oldest===

A number of pubs claim to be the oldest surviving establishment in the United Kingdom, although in several cases original buildings have been demolished and replaced on the same site. Others are ancient buildings that saw uses other than as a pub during their history. [[Ye Olde Fighting Cocks]] in [[St Albans]], [[Hertfordshire]], holds the [[Guinness World Records|Guinness World Record]] for the oldest pub in England, as it is an 11th-century structure on an 8th-century site. [[Ye Olde Trip to Jerusalem]] in [[Nottingham]] is claimed to be the &quot;oldest inn in England&quot;. It has a claimed date of 1189, based on the fact it is constructed on the site of the [[Nottingham Castle]] brewhouse; the present building dates from around 1650.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.triptojerusalem.com/the-legend-of-ye-olde-trip-to-jerusalem |title=The Legend of Ye Olde Trip To Jerusalem |publisher=Ye Olde Trip to Jerusalem |accessdate=24 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, The Nags Head in [[Burntwood]], [[Staffordshire]] only dates back to the 16th century, but there has been a pub on the site since at least 1086, as it is mentioned in the [[Domesday Book]].

There is archaeological evidence that parts of the foundations of The Old Ferryboat Inn in [[Holywell, Cambridgeshire|Holywell]] may date to AD 460, and there is evidence of ale being served as early as AD 560.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

[[The Bingley Arms]], [[Bardsey, West Yorkshire|Bardsey]], Yorkshire, is claimed to date to 905&amp;nbsp;AD. [[Ye Olde Salutation Inn]] in Nottingham dates from 1240, although the building served as a tannery and a private residence before becoming an inn sometime before the [[English Civil War]]. The Adam and Eve in [[Norwich]] was first recorded in 1249, when it was an alehouse for the workers constructing nearby [[Norwich Cathedral]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Adam and Eve pub Bishopgate, Norwich |author=Peter Sargent |newspaper=Eastern Daily Press |url=http://www.edp24.co.uk/norfolk-life/norfolk-history/1_adam_and_eve_1_213829}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ye Olde Man &amp; Scythe]] in [[Bolton]], Lancashire, is mentioned by name in a charter of 1251, but the current building is dated 1631. Its cellars are the only surviving part of the older structure.

===London===
Many of London's pubs are known to have been used by famous people, but in some cases, such as the association between [[Samuel Johnson]] and [[Ye Olde Cheshire Cheese]], this is speculative, based on little more than the fact that the person is known to have lived nearby. However, [[Charles Dickens]] is known to have visited the Cheshire Cheese, the [[Prospect of Whitby]], [[Ye Olde Cock Tavern]] and many others. [[Samuel Pepys]] is also associated with the Prospect of Whitby and the Cock Tavern.

The [[Fitzroy Tavern]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.beerintheevening.com/pubs/s/70/703/ Fitzroy Tavern, Fitzrovia, London W1T 2NA].&lt;/ref&gt; is a pub situated at 16 [[Charlotte Street]] in the [[Fitzrovia]] district, to which it gives its name. It became famous (or according to others, infamous) during a period spanning the 1920s to the mid-1950s as a meeting place for many of London's artists, [[intellectual]]s and [[Bohemianism|bohemian]]s such as [[Dylan Thomas]], [[Augustus John]], and [[George Orwell]]. Several establishments in [[Soho]], London, have associations with well-known, post-war literary and artistic figures, including the [[Pillars of Hercules (pub)|Pillars of Hercules]], [[The Colony Room]] and the [[Coach and Horses, Soho|Coach and Horses]]. The Canonbury Tavern, [[Canonbury]], was the prototype for Orwell's ideal English pub, ''[[The Moon Under Water]]''.

The Red Lion in [[Parliament Square]] is close to the [[Palace of Westminster]] and is consequently used by political journalists and members of parliament. The pub is equipped with a [[Division bell]] that summons MPs back to the chamber when they are required to take part in a vote.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Westminster: For whom the division bell tolls |first=Nick |last=Lloyd-Jones |newspaper=The Independent |date=4 May 2005 |url=http://www.questia.com/library/1P2-1941469/uk-focus-westminster-for-whom-the-division-bell | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[The Punch Bowl, Mayfair]] was at one time jointly owned by [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] and [[Guy Ritchie]].&lt;ref name=Telegraph&gt;{{cite news | date = 20 November 2009 | title = Madonna and Guy Ritchie reach divorce settlement |work=The Daily Telegraph  | author = Gammell, Caroline &amp; Singh, Anita  | url = http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/celebritynews/3490550/Madonna-and-Guy-Ritchie-reach-divorce-settlement.html | accessdate =17 December 2009 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Coleherne public house]] in [[Earls Court]] was a well-known gay pub from the 1950s. It attracted many well-known patrons, such as [[Freddie Mercury]], [[Kenny Everett]] and [[Rudolph Nureyev]]. It was used by the serial-killer [[Colin Ireland]] to pick up victims.

In 1966 [[The Blind Beggar]] in [[Whitechapel]] became infamous as the scene of a murder committed by gangster [[Ronnie Kray]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/march/4/newsid_2515000/2515103.stm |title=BBC ON THIS DAY &amp;#124; 4 &amp;#124; 1969: Kray twins guilty of McVitie murder |publisher=BBC News |date=4 March 1976 |accessdate=9 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Ten Bells (public house)|Ten Bells]] is associated with several of the victims of [[Jack the Ripper]]. In 1955, [[Ruth Ellis]], the last woman executed in the United Kingdom, shot David Blakely as he emerged from ''The Magdala'' in [[South Hill Park (London street)|South Hill Park]], [[Hampstead]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fancyapint.com/pubs/pub526.html &quot;The Magdala&quot;] ''FancyaPint.com'' (Retrieved 13 February 2010)&lt;/ref&gt; the bullet holes can still be seen in the walls outside. It is said that [[Vladimir Lenin]] and a young [[Joseph Stalin]] met in the ''Crown and Anchor'' pub (now known as ''The Crown Tavern'') on [[Clerkenwell|Clerkenwell Green]] when the latter was visiting London in 1903.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.shadyoldlady.com/location.php?loc=2007|title=Lenin and Stalin meeting|accessdate=13 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Angel, Islington was formerly a [[coaching inn]], the first on the route northwards out of London, where [[Thomas Paine]] is believed to have written much of ''[[The Rights of Man]]''. It was mentioned by Charles Dickens, became a [[Lyons Corner House]], and is now a [[The Co-operative Bank|Co-operative Bank]].

===Oxford and Cambridge===
[[The Eagle and Child]] and the [[Lamb &amp; Flag (Oxford)|Lamb and Flag]], Oxford, were regular meeting places of the [[Inklings]], a writers' group which included [[J. R. R. Tolkien]] and [[C. S. Lewis]]. [[The Eagle (pub)|The Eagle]] in Cambridge is where [[Francis Crick]] interrupted patrons' lunchtime on 28 February 1953 to announce that he and [[James D. Watson|James Watson]] had &quot;discovered the secret of life&quot; after they had come up with their proposal for the structure of [[DNA]].&lt;ref&gt;Regis, Ed (2009) ''What Is Life?: investigating the nature of life in the age of synthetic biology''. Oxford: [[Oxford University Press]] ISBN 0-19-538341-9; p. 52&lt;/ref&gt; The anecdote is related in Watson's book ''[[The Double Helix]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/2804545.stm|title='Secret of life' discovery turns 50|publisher=BBC|date=27 February 2003|first=Ivan|last=Noble}}&lt;/ref&gt; and commemorated with a blue plaque on the outside wall.

Although &quot;British&quot; pubs found outside of [[Great Britain|Britain]] and its former colonies are often themed bars owing little to the original British pub, a number of &quot;true&quot; pubs may be found around the world.

In Denmark—a country, like Britain, with a long tradition of brewing—a number of pubs have opened which eschew &quot;theming&quot;, and which instead focus on the business of providing carefully conditioned beer, often independent of any particular brewery or chain, in an environment which would not be unfamiliar to a British pub-goer. Some import British cask ale, rather than beer in kegs, to provide the full British real ale experience to their customers. This newly established Danish interest in British cask beer and the British pub tradition is reflected by the fact that some 56 British cask beers were available at the 2008 European Beer Festival in [[Copenhagen]], which was attended by more than 20,000 people.

In Ireland, pubs are known for their atmosphere or &quot;[[craic]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.edgehill.ac.uk/edgeways/issue2/craic.htm |title=What's the Craic? |publisher=Edgehill.ac.uk |accessdate=26 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Irish, a pub is referred to as ''teach tábhairne'' (&quot;tavernhouse&quot;) or ''teach óil'' (&quot;drinkinghouse&quot;). Live music, either sessions of traditional Irish music or varieties of modern popular music, is frequently featured in the pubs of Ireland. Pubs in [[Northern Ireland]] are largely identical to their counterparts in the [[Republic of Ireland]] except for the lack of spirit grocers. A side effect of &quot;[[The Troubles]]&quot; was that the lack of a tourist industry meant that a higher proportion of traditional bars have survived the wholesale refitting of Irish pub interiors in the 'English style' in the 1950s and 1960s. New Zealand sports a number of Irish pubs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Consulate General of Ireland: Bars and pubs|url=http://www.ireland.co.nz/directory-of-contacts/bars-pubs/|accessdate=27 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most popular term in English-speaking Canada used for a drinking establishment was &quot;tavern&quot;, until the 1970s when the term &quot;bar&quot; became widespread as in the United States. In the 1800s the term used was &quot;public house&quot; as in England but &quot;pub culture&quot; did not spread to Canada. A fake &quot;English looking&quot; pub trend started in the 1990s, built into existing storefronts, like regular bars. Most universities in Canada have campus pubs which are central to student life, as it would be bad form just to serve alcohol to students without providing some type of basic food. Often these pubs are run by the [[student's union]]. The gastropub concept has caught on, as traditional British influences are to be found in many Canadian dishes. There are now pubs in the large cities of Canada that cater to anyone interested in a &quot;pub&quot; type drinking environment.{{citation needed|date=November 2015|reason=please provide a source for this entire paragraph}}

[[Fatwa]]s have been issued declaring that Muslims who live in regions with natural phenomenon such as the [[midnight sun]] or [[polar night]] should follow the timetable of [[Mecca]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.saudiaramcoworld.com/issue/201201/ramadan.in.the.farthest.north.htm|title=Saudi Aramco World: Ramadan in the Farthest North|publisher=|accessdate=16 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While fasting from dawn until sunset, Muslims refrain from consuming food, drinking liquids, smoking, and engaging in sexual relations with one's spouse. Muslims are also instructed to refrain from sinful behavior that may negate the reward of fasting, such as false speech (insulting, [[backbiting]], cursing, lying, etc.) and fighting.&lt;ref&gt;IslamQA, &quot;It is not permissible for one who is fasting to insult anyone&quot;, URL: http://islamqa.info/en/37658&lt;/ref&gt; Food and drink is served daily, before dawn and after sunset.&lt;ref&gt;Islam, Andrew Egan - 2002 - page 24&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dubai - Page 189, Andrea Schulte-Peevers - 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Spiritual rewards (''thawab'') for fasting are also believed to be multiplied within the month of Ramadan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://hadithcollection.com/sahihbukhari/64-Sahih%20Bukhari%20Book%2031.%20Fasting/2465-sahih-bukhari-volume-003-book-031-hadith-number-125.html |title= Sahih Bukhari - Book 031 (The Book of Fasting), Hadith 125. |first= AbdAllah-Muhammad|last= Bukhari-Ibn-Ismail |work= hadithcollection.com |accessdate= 25 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fasting for Muslims during Ramadan typically includes the increased offering of ''[[salat]]'' (prayers) and recitation of the [[Quran]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.cmje.org/religious-texts/hadith/abudawud/006-sat.php |title= Sunan Abu-Dawud - (The Book of Prayer) - Detailed Injunctions about Ramadan, Hadith 1370 |first= Sulayman |last= [[Abu Dawud]]-Ibn-Ash'ath-AsSijisstani |work= Center for Muslim-Jewish Engagement of The University of Southern California |accessdate= 25 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://hadithcollection.com/sahihbukhari/64-Sahih%20Bukhari%20Book%2031.%20Fasting/2391-sahih-bukhari-volume-003-book-031-hadith-number-199.html |title= Sahih Bukhari - Book 031 (The Book of Fasting), Hadith 199. |first= AbdAllah-Muhammad|last= Bukhari-Ibn-Ismail |work= hadithcollection.com |accessdate= 25 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Chapter 2, Revelation 185, of the Quran states:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The month of Ramadan is that in which was revealed the Quran; a guidance for mankind, and clear proofs of the guidance, and the criterion (of right and wrong). And whosoever of you is present, let him fast the month, and whosoever of you is sick or on a journey, a number of other days. Allah desires for you ease; He desires not hardship for you; and that you should complete the period, and that you should magnify Allah for having guided you, and that perhaps you may be thankful.{{cite quran|2|185}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;It is believed that the [[Quran]] was first revealed to Muhammad during the month of Ramadan which has been referred to as the &quot;best of times&quot;. The first [[revelation]] was sent down on ''[[Laylat al-Qadr]]'' (The night of Power) which is one of the five odd nights of the last ten days of Ramadan.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Magnificence of Quran|url = https://books.google.co.in/books?id=AKmmBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT29&amp;dq=ramadan+quran+revealed&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=ramadan%2520quran%2520revealed&amp;f=false|publisher = Darussalam Publishers|date = 2006|first = Mahmood Bin Ahmad Bin Saaleh|last = Ad-Dausaree}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[hadith]], all holy scriptures were sent down during Ramadan.

According to the Quran, fasting was also obligatory for prior nations, and is a way to attain ''[[taqwa]]'', fear of God.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Explanation of the Three Fundamental Principles of Islam (Salafi): Sharh Usool ath-Thalatha of Muhammad Ibn Abdul Wahaab|url = https://books.google.co.in/books?id=EbamAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT63#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|publisher = Salafi Books|first = Shaikh Saalih|last = al-Uthaymeen}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Cite quran|2|183}} [[Allah|God]] proclaimed to Muhammad that fasting for His sake was not a new innovation in monotheism, but rather an obligation practiced by those truly devoted to the oneness of God.&lt;ref&gt;Quran Chapter 2, Revelation 183&lt;/ref&gt; The pagans of Mecca also fasted, but only on tenth day of [[Muharram]] to expiate sins and avoid droughts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Loud Thoughts on Religion: A Version of the System Study of Religion.

The ruling to observe fasting during Ramadan was sent down 18 months after Hijra, during the month of [[Sha'aban]] in the second year of [[Hijri year|Hijra]] in 624 CE.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rafig&quot; /&gt;

Abu Zanad, an Arabic writer from [[Iraq]] who lived after the founding of Islam,in around 747 CE, wrote that at least one [[Mandaeism|Mandaean]] community located in [[Al-Jazira, Mesopotamia|al-Jazira]] (modern northern Iraq) observed Ramadan before converting to Islam.&lt;ref&gt;See Ibn Qutaybah,op.cit.page 204; Cited by Sinasi Gunduz, The Knowledge of Life, Oxford University, 1994, p. 25, note 403: &quot;Abu al-Fida, op-cit., p.148; Bar Habraeus, op.cit. p.266, Ibn Hazm claims that this fast is the fast of Ramadan (of the Muslims), but this is completely wrong.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;{{failed verification|date=June 2015}}

According to Philip Jenkins, Ramadan comes &quot;from the strict Lenten discipline of the Syrian churches&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Jenkins, Philip (2006-07-31).

Kindle Edition.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Dubious|Ramadans Alleged Pagan Origins.|reason=May not be a mainstream viewpoint or may be undue weight|date=June 2015}} However, this suggestion is based on the orientalist idea that the Qur'an itself has Syrian origins, which was refuted by Muslim academics such as M. Al-Azami.&lt;ref&gt;Muhammad Mustafa al-Azami, &quot;The History of The Qur'anic Text: From Revelation to Compilation: A Comparative Study with the Old and New Testaments&quot;, 2nd Edition (2008), Azami Publishing House&lt;/ref&gt;

==Important dates==
The beginning and end of Ramadan are determined by the lunar [[Islamic calendar]].

===Beginning===
[[File:Ramadan100years1938-2037.png|thumb|Click to view larger image]]
''[[Hilal (crescent moon)|Hilāl]]'' (the [[Lunar phase|crescent]]) is typically a day (or more) after the astronomical new moon. Since the new moon marks the beginning of the new month, Muslims can usually safely estimate the beginning of Ramadan.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hilalsighting.org/papers/salman.pdf Hilal Sighting &amp; Islamic Dates: Issues and Solution Insha'Allaah]. Hilal Sighting Committee of North America ([http://www.hilalsighting.org/ website]). Retrieved 19 August 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; However, to many Muslims, this is not in accordance with authenticated Hadiths stating that visual confirmation per region is recommended. The consistent variations of a day have existed since the time of Muhammad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://hadithcollection.com/sahihbukhari/64-Sahih%20Bukhari%20Book%2031.%20Fasting/2466-sahih-bukhari-volume-003-book-031-hadith-number-124.html |title= Sahih Bukhari - Book 031 (The Book of Fasting), Hadith 124 |first= AbdAllah-Muhammad|last= Bukhari-Ibn-Ismail |work= hadithcollection.com |accessdate= 25 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Night of Power===
{{Main|Laylat al-Qadr}}
[[Laylat al-Qadr]], which in Arabic means &quot;the night of power&quot; or &quot;the night of decree&quot;, is considered the holiest night of the year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last = Robinson | first = Neal | title = Islam: A Concise Introduction | publisher = Georgetown University Press | year = 1999 | location = Washington | doi = | id = | isbn = 0-87840-224-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://hadithcollection.com/sahihbukhari/64-Sahih%20Bukhari%20Book%2031.%20Fasting/2465-sahih-bukhari-volume-003-book-031-hadith-number-125.html |title= Sahih Bukhari - Book 031 (The Book of Fasting), Hadith 125|first= AbdAllah-Muhammad|last= Ibn-Ismail-Bukhari |work= hadithcollection.com |accessdate= 28 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is the night in which Muslims believe the first revelation of the Quran was sent down to Muhammad stating that this night was &quot;better than one thousand months [of proper worship], as stated in Chapter 97:3 of the Qu'ran.

Also, generally, Laylat al-Qadr is believed to have occurred on an odd-numbered night during the last ten days of Ramadan, i.e., the night of the 21st, 23rd, 25th, 27th or 29th. The Dawoodi Bohra Community believe that the 23rd night is laylat al Qadr.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://hadithcollection.com/sahihbukhari/65-Sahih%20Bukhari%20Book%2032.%20Praying%20at%20Night%20In%20Ramadhan%20(Taraweeh)/2479-sahih-bukhari-volume-003-book-032-hadith-number-238.html |title= Sahih Bukhari - Book 032 (Praying at Night during Ramadhan), Hadith 238|first= AbdAllah-Muhammad|last= Ibn-Ismail-Bukhari |work= hadithcollection.com |accessdate= 28 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===End===
{{Main|Eid al-Fitr|Eid prayers}}
The holiday of ''Eid al-Fitr'' (Arabic:عيد الفطر) marks the end of Ramadan and the beginning of the next lunar month, [[Shawwal]]. This first day of the following month is declared after another crescent [[new moon]] has been sighted or the completion of 30 days of fasting if no visual sighting is possible due to weather conditions. This first day of Shawwal is called Eid al-Fitr. ''Eid al-Fitr'' may also be a reference towards the festive nature of having endured the month of fasting successfully and returning to the more natural disposition (''fitra'') of being able to eat, drink and resume intimacy with spouses during the day.{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}}

==Religious practices==

The predominant practice during Ramadan is fasting from dawn to sunset. The pre-dawn meal before the fast is called the ''suhur'', while the meal at sunset that breaks the fast is the ''iftar''. Considering the high diversity of the global Muslim population, it is impossible to describe typical suhur or iftar meals.

Muslims also engage in increased prayer and charity during Ramadan. Ramadan is also a month where Muslims try to practice increased self-discipline. This is motivated by the Hadith, especially in Al-Bukhari&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sunnah.com/bukhari/30/|title=Book of Fasting - Sahih al-Bukhari - Sunnah.com - Sayings and Teachings of Prophet Muhammad (صلى الله عليه و سلم)|publisher=|accessdate=16 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Muslim,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hadithcollection.com/.../10999-sahih-muslim-book-006-hadith-number%20-2361.html|title=Sahih Muslim Book 006, Hadith Number 2361.|work=Hadith Collection|accessdate=16 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; that &quot;When Ramadan arrives, the gates of Paradise are opened and the gates of hell are locked up and devils are put in chains.&quot;&lt;ref name=guardian&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.ngrguardiannews.com/features/weekend/169233-muslims-observe-ramadan-clerics-explain-significance | title = Muslims observe Ramadan, clerics explain significance |work= Guardian News, Nigeria |date= 2014-07-04|accessdate=2014-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fasting===
{{Main|Sawm of Ramadan}}
Ramadan is a time of spiritual reflection, improvement and increased devotion and worship. Muslims are expected to put more effort into following the teachings of Islam. The fast (sawm) begins at dawn and ends at sunset. In addition to abstaining from eating and drinking, Muslims also increase restraint, such as abstaining from sexual relations and generally sinful speech and behavior. The act of fasting is said to redirect the heart away from worldly activities, its purpose being to cleanse the soul by freeing it from harmful impurities. Ramadan also teaches Muslims how to better practice self-discipline, self-control,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/birmingham/content/articles/2008/08/29/ramadhan_2008_feature.shtml Why Ramadan brings us together]; ''[[BBC]]'', 1 September 2008&lt;/ref&gt; sacrifice, and empathy for those who are less fortunate; thus encouraging actions of generosity and compulsory charity ([[zakat]]).&lt;ref name=WP&gt;[http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/09/27/AR2008092702592_2.html?nav=rss_world Help for the Heavy at Ramadan], ''[[Washington Post]]'', 27 September 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

It becomes compulsory for Muslims to start fasting when they reach puberty, so long as they are healthy and sane, and have no disabilities or illnesses. Many children endeavour to complete as many fasts as possible as practice for later life.

Exemptions to fasting are travel, menstruation, severe illness, pregnancy, and breast-feeding. However, many Muslims with medical conditions insist on fasting to satisfy their spiritual needs, although it is not recommended by the hadith. Professionals should closely monitor individuals who decide to persist with fasting.&lt;ref name=&quot;dieticiannour&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.todaysdietitian.com/newarchives/072709p56.shtml |title=Understanding Muslim Fasting Practices |first1= Dr. Nour |last1=El-Zibdeh |work=todaysdietitian.com |accessdate=25 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those who were unable to fast still must make up the days missed later.&lt;ref name=&quot;q2-184&quot;&gt;{{cite quran|2|184|s=nosup}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Suhur====
{{Main|Suhur}}
[[File:Iftar in Istanbul Turkey.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Iftar]] at [[Sultan Ahmed Mosque]] in [[Istanbul]], [[Turkey]]]]
Each day, before dawn, Muslims observe a pre-fast meal called the [[suhur]]. After stopping a short time before dawn, Muslims begin the first prayer of the day, [[Fajr]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.hadithcollection.com/sahihmuslim/134-Sahih%20Muslim%20Book%2006.%20Fasting/10921-sahih-muslim-book-006-hadith-number-2415.html |title= Sahih Muslim - Book 006 (The Book of Fasting), Hadith 2415 |first= Abul-Hussain |last= Muslim-Ibn-Habaj | work= hadithcollection.com |year= 2009 |accessdate= 25 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://hadithcollection.com/sahihbukhari/64-Sahih%20Bukhari%20Book%2031.%20Fasting/2446-sahih-bukhari-volume-003-book-031-hadith-number-144.html |title= Sahih Bukhari - Book 031 (The Book of Fasting), Hadith 144 |first= AbdAllah-Muhammad|last= Ibn-Ismail-Bukhari |work= hadithcollection.com |year= 2009 |accessdate= 25 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; At sunset, families hasten for the fast-breaking meal known as [[iftar]].

====Iftar====
{{Main|Iftar}}
In the evening, [[Phoenix dactylifera#Dates|dates]] are usually the first food to break the fast; according to tradition, Muhammad broke fast with three dates. Following that, Muslims generally adjourn for the Maghrib prayer, the fourth of the five daily [[prayers]], after which the main meal is served.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mysanantonio.com/news/Muslims_fast_and_feast_as_Ramadan_begins.html?showFullArticle=y |title=Muslims fast and feast as Ramadan begins |first=Melissa |last=Fletcher Stoeltje
|date=22 August 2009 |accessdate=22 July 2012 |work=[[San Antonio Express-News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Social gatherings, many times in a [[buffet]] style, are frequent at iftar. Traditional dishes are often highlighted, including traditional desserts, and particularly those made only during Ramadan. Water is usually the beverage of choice, but juice and milk are also often available, as are soft drinks and caffeinated beverages.&lt;ref name=&quot;dieticiannour&quot; /&gt;

In the [[Middle East]], the iftar meal consists of water, juices, dates, salads and appetizers, one or more main dishes, and various kinds of desserts. Usually, the dessert is the most important part during iftar. Typical main dishes are lamb stewed with wheat berries, lamb kebabs with grilled vegetables, or roast chicken served with chickpea-studded rice pilaf. A rich dessert, such as luqaimat, [[baklava]] or [[kanafeh|kunafeh]] (a buttery, syrup-sweetened kadaifi noodle pastry filled with cheese), concludes the meal.&lt;ref name=&quot;la&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.latimes.com/features/food/la-fo-ramadan-20120721,0,1433650.story |title=Ramadan's high note is often a dip |first1=Faye |last1=Levy |first2=Yakir |last2=Levy |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=21 July 2012 |accessdate=22 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over time, iftar has grown into banquet festivals. This is a time of fellowship with families, friends and surrounding communities, but may also occupy larger spaces at masjid or banquet halls for 100 or more diners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/2010-08-08/news/fl-ramadan-food-20100808_1_iftar-fasting-muslims-hail |title=Ramadan: Muslims feast and fast during holy month |first=James D. |last=Davis |date=8 August 2010 |accessdate=22 July 2012 |work=[[South Florida Sun-Sentinel]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Charity===
{{Main|Zakāt|Sadaqah}}
[[File:Men praying in Afghanistan.jpg|thumb|Men praying during Ramadan at the [[Shrine of Hazrat Ali]] or &quot;Blue Mosque&quot; in [[Mazar-i-Sharif]], [[Afghanistan]]]]
Charity is very important in Islam, and even more so during Ramadan. [[Zakāt]], often translated as &quot;the poor-rate&quot;, is obligatory as one of the pillars of Islam; a fixed percentage of the person's savings is required to be given to the poor. [[Sadaqah]] is voluntary charity in giving above and beyond what is required from the obligation of zakāt. In Islam, all good deeds are more handsomely rewarded during Ramadan than in any other month of the year. Consequently, many will choose this time to give a larger portion, if not all, of the zakāt that they are obligated to give. In addition, many will also use this time to give a larger portion of sadaqah in order to maximize the reward that will await them at the [[Last Judgment]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2012}}

===Nightly prayers===
{{Main|Tarawih}}

Tarawih ({{lang-ar|تراويح}}) refers to extra prayers performed by Muslims at night in the Islamic month of Ramadan. Contrary to popular belief, they are not compulsory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.islamhelpline.com/qa/tarawih-prayer-nafl-or-sunnah|title=Tarawih Prayer a Nafl or Sunnah|publisher=|accessdate=16 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, many Muslims pray these prayers in the evening during Ramadan. Some scholars{{Who|date=July 2013}} maintain that Tarawih is neither ''[[fard]]'' or a ''[[Sunnah]]'', but is the preponed ''[[Tahajjud]]'' (night prayer) prayer shifted to post-''[[Isha']]'' for the ease of believers. But a majority of Sunni scholars regard the Tarawih prayers as ''Sunnat al-Mu'akkadah'', a salaat that was performed by the [[Prophets of Islam|Islamic prophet]] Muhammad very consistently.

===Recitation of the Quran===
In addition to fasting, Muslims are encouraged to read the entire Quran. Some Muslims perform the recitation of the entire Quran by means of special prayers, called [[Tarawih]]. These voluntary prayers are held in the mosques every night of the month, during which a whole section of the Quran (''[[juz']]'', which is 1/30 of the Quran) is recited. Therefore, the entire Quran would be completed at the end of the month. Although it is not required to read the whole Quran in the Tarawih prayers, it is common.

==Cultural practices==

[[File:Ramadan jerusalem kmhad.jpg|thumb|upright|Ramadan in the Old City of [[Jerusalem]]]]

In some Muslim countries today, lights are strung up in public squares, and across city streets, to add to the festivities of the month. [[Lantern]]s have become symbolic decorations welcoming the month of Ramadan. In a growing number of countries, they are hung on city streets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://abcnews.go.com/International/slideshow/muslims-begin-fasting-start-ramadan-holy-month-16822614 |title= Muslims begin fasting for Ramadan|first= |last= |work= ABC News |date= 18 July 2012 |accessdate= 6 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.thenational.ae/thenationalconversation/comment/the-spirit-of-ramadan-is-here-but-why-is-it-still-so-dark |title=The spirit of Ramadan is here, but why is it still so dark? |author= Taryam Al Subaihi |date= 29 July 2012 |work= The National|accessdate= 30 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://shine.yahoo.com/decorate-ramadan-175400368.html |title= How to decorate for Ramadan |first= Sylvia |last= Cochran |work= Yahoo-Shine|date= 8 August 2011 |accessdate= 6 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tradition of lanterns as a decoration becoming associated with Ramadan is believed to have originated during the [[Fatimid Caliphate]] primarily centered in [[Egypt]], where [[Caliph]] [[al-Mu'izz li-Din Allah]] was greeted by people holding lanterns to celebrate his ruling. From that time, lanterns were used to light mosques and houses throughout the capital city of [[Cairo]]. Shopping malls, places of business, and people's homes can be seen with stars and crescents and various lighting effects, as well.

As the nation with the world's largest Muslim population, [[Indonesia]] has diverse Ramadan traditions. On the island of [[Java]], many [[Javanese people|Javanese Indonesians]] bathe in holy springs to prepare for fasting, a ritual known as ''Padusa''. The city of [[Semarang]] marks the beginning of Ramadan with the Dugderan carnival, which involves parading the [[Warak ngendog]], a dragon-like creature allegedly inspired by the [[Buraq]]. In the Chinese-influenced capital city of [[Jakarta]], fire crackers were traditionally used to wake people up for morning prayer, until the 19th Century. Towards the end of Ramadan, most employees receive a one-month bonus known as ''Tunjangan Hari Raya''. Certain kinds of food are especially popular during Ramadan, such as beef in [[Aceh]], and snails in [[Central Java]]. The [[iftar]] meal is announced every evening by striking the [[bedug]], a giant drum, in the mosque.

Common greetings during Ramadan are &quot;Ramadan Mubarak&quot; or &quot;Ramadan Kareem&quot;, which wish the recipient a blessed or generous Ramadan.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/06/15/ramadan-2015-facts-dates_n_7554256.html Ramadan 2015: Facts, History, Dates, Greeting And Rules About The Muslim Fast], [[Huffington Post]], 2015-06-15&lt;/ref&gt;

== Penalties for infraction ==
In some [[List of Muslim majority countries|Muslim countries]], failing to fast or the open flouting of such behavior during Ramadan is considered a [[crime]] and is prosecuted as such. For instance, in [[Algeria]], in October 2008 the court of [[Biskra]] condemned six people to four years in prison and heavy fines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Algerians jailed for breaking Ramadan fast |url=http://www.alarabiya.net/articles/2008/10/07/57856.html |work=Al Arabiya News |date=7 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Kuwait]], according to law number 44 of 1968, the penalty is a fine of no more than 100 [[Kuwaiti dinar]]s, or jail for no more than one month, or both penalties, for those seen eating, drinking or smoking during Ramadan daytime.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.moi.gov.kw/portal/vEnglish/pressrel.asp?objectid={220CBBC3-8EA9-4835-A491-C368B0689E55}&amp;catid={506BD210-2218-41DE-9648-30A1C3AAD0F6}&amp;year=&amp;relid={57BF4B27-AAFB-4F61-9065-B013FA96A464} Press release by Kuwait Ministry Of Interior]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | last = | first = | title = KD 100 fine, one month prison for public eating, drinking | newspaper = Friday Times | location = | language = &lt;!-- English --&gt; | publisher = Kuwait Times Newspaper | date = 21 August 2009 | url = http://www.kuwaittimes.net/read_news.php?newsid=MTE3NDM5MzY5NA | accessdate = 17 November 2009}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
In the [[United Arab Emirates|U.A.E.]], eating or drinking in public during the daytime of Ramadan is considered a minor offence and would be punished by up to 150 hours of community service.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | last = Salama | first = Samir | title = New penalty for minor offences in UAE | newspaper = Gulf News | location = Dubai, UAE | pages = | language = | publisher = Al Nisr Publishing LLC | date = 16 July 2009 | url = http://gulfnews.com/news/gulf/uae/crime/new-penalty-for-minor-offences-in-uae-1.492892 | accessdate = 17 November 2009}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Egypt]], alcohol sales are banned during Ramadan.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://english.ahram.org.eg/NewsContent/1/64/48444/Egypt/Politics-/Egypts-tourism-minister-confirms-alcohol-prohibiti.aspx Egypt's tourism minister 'confirms' alcohol prohibition on Islamic holidays beyond Ramadan],&quot; ''[[Al-Ahram]], 22 July 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014 in Kermanshah, [[Iran]], a non-Muslim was sentenced to having his lips burnt with a cigarette and five Muslims were publicly flogged with 70 stripes for eating during Ramadan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2702774/Christian-sentenced-Iranian-judge-lips-burnt-cigarette-eating-Ramadan.html | title = Christian sentenced by Iranian judge to have his lips burnt with a cigarette for eating during Ramadan

=== Other legal issues ===
Some countries have laws that amend work schedules during Ramadan. Under U.A.E. labor law, the maximum working hours are to be 6 hours per day and 36 hours per week. [[Qatar]], [[Oman]], [[Bahrain]] and Kuwait have similar laws.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dlapiper.com/files/Publication/2cde821c-0999-49a7-a472-7b198caeb169/Presentation/PublicationAttachment/588752a7-2159-4538-8938-7da1610c0faa/DLA_Piper_Middle_East_Be_Alert_Ramadan.pdf Employment Issues During Ramadan – The Gulf Region], DLA Piper Middle East.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Health ==

Ramadan fasting is safe for healthy people, but those with medical conditions should seek medical advice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Azizi F |title=Islamic fasting and health |journal=Ann.

===Renal disease===
A review of the literature by an Iranian group suggested fasting during Ramadan might produce [[renal injury]] in patients with moderate (GFR &lt;60 ml/min) or worse [[kidney disease]], but was not injurious to [[renal transplant]] patients with good function or most stone forming patients.&lt;ref name=&quot;renal diseases mini review&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | title=Ramadan fasting and patients with renal diseases: A mini review of the literature | author=Emami-Naini A, Roomizadeh P, Baradaran A, Abedini A, Abtahi M. | journal=J Res Med Sci. |date=August 2013 | volume=18 | issue=8 | pages=711–716 | pmid=24379850 | ISSN=1735-1995 | publisher=Official Journal of [[Isfahan University of Medical Sciences]] | pmc=3872613}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Crime rates==
The correlation of Ramadan with crime rates is mixed: some statistics show that crime rates drop during Ramadan, while others show that it rises. Decreases in crime rates have been reported by the police in some cities in Turkey ([[Istanbul]],&lt;ref name= &quot;zaman&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.todayszaman.com/national_crime-rate-falls-in-ramadan_254431.html | title = Crime rate falls during Ramadan |work= Today's Zaman |date=2011-08-21 |accessdate=2014-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Konya]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/default.aspx?pageid=438&amp;n=crime-rate-drops-over-ramadan-2002-11-16 |title=Crime rate drops over Ramadan |date=16 November 2002 |accessdate=24 June 2015 |publisher=Turkish Daily News }}&lt;/ref&gt;) and the [[Eastern province]] of Saudi Arabia.&lt;ref name=arabnews&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arabnews.com/news/459414 | title = Eastern Province crime falls 40% during Ramadan |date= 2013-07-28|accessdate=2014-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2012 study showed that crime rates decreased in [[Iran]] during Ramadan, and that decrease was [[Statistical significance|statistically significant]].&lt;ref name= irjabs&gt;{{Citation | last = Tavakoli | first = Nasrin | title = Effect of spirituality on decreasing crimes and social damages: A case study on Ramadan | journal = International Research Journal of Applied and Basic Sciences | pages = 518–524 | year = 2012 |url= http://www.irjabs.com/files_site/paperlist/r_325_121110001354.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2005 study found that there was a decrease in assault, robbery and alcohol-related crimes during Ramadan in Saudi Arabia, but only the decrease in alcohol related crimes was statistically significant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.nauss.edu.sa/En/DigitalLibrary/ScientificTheses/Documents/Master_1425-1426_PS_ps26en.pdf | title = The effect of Ramadan on crime rates in Saudi Arabia, Hattab Ben Thawab Al-Sobaye |work= Naif Arab University for Social Sciences, Thesis publication |date=2011-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Increases in crime rates during Ramadan have been reported in Turkey,&lt;ref name=tdn&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/129-women-killed-in-six-months-in-turkey-lawmaker-says.aspx?pageID=238&amp;nID=69005&amp;NewsCatID=509 |title= 129 women killed in six months in Turkey, lawmaker says |work= Hurriyet Daily News |date=2014-07-11 |accessdate=2014-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jakarta]],&lt;ref name= &quot;jpost&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2011/08/19/crime-rates-increase-during-ramadhan.html | title = Crime rates increase during Ramadhan |work= Jakarta Post |date=2011-08-19 |accessdate=2014-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = globe&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.thejakartaglobe.com/archive/4-gold-shop-robbers-killed-2-caught-during-police-raids-across-the-city/326794/ | title= 4 Gold Shop Robbers Killed, 2 Caught During Police Raids Across the City |work= Jakarta Post |date=2009-08-29 |accessdate=2014-07-16 | archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://thejakartaglobe.com/home/4-gold-shop-robbers-killed-2-caught-during-police-raids-across-the-city/326794&amp;date=2011-07-12 | archivedate= 2011-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=jakartacity&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.jakarta.go.id/eng/news/2014/06/anticipating-crime-7500-policemen-put-on-standby-along-ramadan | title = Anticipating Crime, 7,500 Policemen Put on Standby Along Ramadan | work= Department of Communication, Informatics and Public Relations of Jakarta Capital City |date=2014-07-16 |accessdate=2014-07-16 | archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/6R7ZlfPNC | archivedate= 2014-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; parts of Algeria,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.elwatan.com/archives/article.php?id_sans_version=87359 | title = Comment le Ramadhan bouleverse la vie des Algériens | work = El Watan, French |date=2010-08-24 |accessdate=2014-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yemen&lt;ref name= yemen&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.yementimes.com/DefaultDET.aspx?i=1287&amp;p=local&amp;a=1 | title = Yemen child trafficking to increase during Ramadan | work = Yemen Times |date= 2009-08-20 | archiveurl= http://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.yementimes.com%2FDefaultDET.aspx%3Fi%3D1287%26p%3Dlocal%26a%3D1&amp;date=2011-04-04 | archivedate= 2011-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Egypt.&lt;ref name=Egypt/&gt;

Various mechanisms have been proposed for the effect of Ramadan on crime:
*An Iranian cleric argues that [[sawm|fasting during Ramadan]] makes people less likely to commit crimes due to spiritual reasons.&lt;ref name=aytolh&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yjc.ir/en/news/1619/ramadan-and-lower-crime-rates | title = ''Ramadan and lower crime rates: The Ayatollah says that during Ramadan the number of criminal cases in the Judiciary diminish by a great degree''.|date= 2013-07-11 |accessdate=2014-07-16 | archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/6R7YSzyKn | archivedate= 2014-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gamal al-Banna]] argues that fasting can stress people out, which can make them more likely to commit crimes. He criticized Muslims who commit crimes while fasting during Ramadan as &quot;fake and superficial&quot;.&lt;ref name=Egypt&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.dailystaregypt.com/article.aspx?ArticleID=3746 | title= Ramadan saw rise in violent domestic crimes | work = Daily News, Egypt |date=2006-11-02 | archiveurl =http://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://www.dailystaregypt.com/article.aspx?ArticleID=3746&amp;date=2011-07-12 | archivedate= 2011-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Police in [[Saudi Arabia]] attributed a drop in crime rates to the &quot;spiritual mood prevalent in the country&quot;.&lt;ref name=arabnews/&gt;
*In Jakarta, Indonesia, police say that the traffic due to 7 million people leaving the city to celebrate [[Eid al-Fitr]] results in an increases in street crime. As a result, police deploy an additional 7,500 personnel.&lt;ref name=jakartacity/&gt;
*During Ramadan, millions of pilgrims enter Saudi Arabia to visit [[Mecca]]. According to the Yemen Times, such pilgrims are usually charitable, and consequently smugglers [[Trafficking of children|traffic children]] in from Yemen to beg on the streets of Saudi Arabia.&lt;ref name= yemen/&gt;

==Ramadan in polar regions==
The length of the dawn to sunset time varies in different parts of the world according to summer or winter solstices of the sun. Most Muslims fast for 11–16 hours during Ramadan. However, in polar regions, the period between dawn and sunset may exceed 22 hours in summers. For example, in 2014, Muslims in Reykjavik, Iceland, and Trondheim, Norway, fasted almost 22 hours, while Muslims in Sydney, Australia, fasted for only about 11 hours. Muslims in areas where continuous night or day is observed during Ramadan follow the fasting hours in the nearest city where fasting is observed at dawn and sunset. Alternatively, Muslims may follow Mecca time.&lt;ref&gt;See article &quot;How Long Muslims Fast For Ramadan Around The World&quot; -Huffingtonpost.co /31 July 2014 and article &quot;Fasting Hours of Ramadan 2014&quot; -Onislam.net / 29 June 2014 and article &quot;The true spirit of Ramadan&quot; -Gulfnews.com /31 July 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

==Employment during Ramadan==
Muslims will continue to work during Ramadan: the prophet Muhammed said that it is important to keep a balance between worship and work. Observance of Ramadan may (or may not) impact upon someone's performance at work.

'''Tourism''' is [[travel]] for pleasure; also the theory and practice of touring, the business of attracting, accommodating, and entertaining tourists, and the business of operating tours.&lt;ref&gt;{{OED|tourism}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tourism may be international, or within the traveler's country. The [[World Tourism Organization]] defines '''tourism''' more generally, in terms which go &quot;beyond the common perception of tourism as being limited to holiday activity only &quot;, as people &quot;traveling to and staying in places outside their usual environment for not more than one consecutive year for leisure, business and other purposes&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;unwto1034&quot;&gt;{{cite web|year=1995|url=http://pub.unwto.org/WebRoot/Store/Shops/Infoshop/Products/1034/1034-1.pdf|title=UNWTO technical manual: Collection of Tourism Expenditure Statistics|page=10|publisher=World Tourism Organization|access-date=26 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tourism can be domestic or international, and international tourism has both incoming and outgoing implications on a country's [[balance of payments]]. Today, tourism is a major source of income for many countries, and affects the economy of both the source and host countries, in some cases being of vital importance.

Tourism suffered as a result of a strong economic slowdown of the [[late-2000s recession]], between the second half of 2008 and the end of 2009, and the outbreak of the [[2009 flu pandemic|H1N1 influenza virus]],&lt;ref name=Barom2009/&gt;&lt;ref name=WTOaugust10/&gt; but slowly recovered. International tourism receipts (the travel item in the [[balance of payments]]) grew to {{USD|1.03}} trillion ({{euro|740}} billion) in 2011, corresponding to an increase in [[Real versus nominal value (economics)|real terms]] of 3.8% from 2010.&lt;ref name=&quot;pr12027&quot;/&gt; International tourist arrivals surpassed the milestone of 1 billion tourists globally for the first time in 2012,&lt;ref name=Barom2012/&gt; the same year in which [[China]] became the largest spender in international tourism globally with {{USD|102}} billion, surpassing [[Germany]] and [[United States]]. China and [[emerging markets]] such as [[Russia]] and [[Brazil]] had significantly increased their spending over the previous decade.&lt;ref name=Barom201304&gt;{{cite web|url=http://media.unwto.org/en/press-release/2013-04-04/china-new-number-one-tourism-source-market-world |title=China - the new number one tourism source market in the world|publisher=[[World Tourism Organization]]|date=2013-04-04|accessdate=2013-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
[[File:Vysoké Tatry r.1922.jpg|thumb|1922 postcard of tourists in the [[High Tatras]], [[Slovakia]].]]

The word ''tourist'' was used by 1772&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Griffiths|first1=Ralph|authorlink1=Ralph Griffiths|author2=Griffiths, G. E. |title=Pennant's Tour in Scotland in 1769|journal=[[Monthly Review (London)|The Monthly Review, Or, Literary Journal]]|year=1772|volume=46|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xS8oAAAAYAAJ&amp;vq=tourist&amp;dq=tourist&amp;pg=PA150|accessdate=23 December 2011|publisher=Printed for R. Griffiths|location=London|page=150}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''tourism'' by 1811.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?allowed_in_frame=0&amp;search=tour&amp;searchmode=none|title=tour (n.)|first1=Douglas|last1=Harper|authorlink1=Douglas Harper|work=[[Online Etymology Dictionary]]|accessdate=23 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

William F. Theobald (1994) suggested that &quot;etymologically, the word ''tour'' is derived from the [[Latin]], 'tornare' and the [[Greek language|Greek]], 'tornos', meaning 'a lathe or circle; movement around a central point or axis'. This meaning has changed in modern English to represent 'one's turn'. The suffix ''–ism'' is defined as 'an action or process; typical behaviour or quality', while the suffix, ''–ist'' denotes 'one who performs a given action'. When the word ''tour'' and the suffixes ''–ism'' and ''–ist'' are combined, they suggest the action of moving in a circle. Describing a circle implies returning to one's starting point, so a tour is a round-trip journey, i.e. the act of leaving and ultimately returning to the original starting point. Therefore, one who takes such a journey can be called a tourist.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;theobald&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Theobald|first=William F.|title=Global Tourism|publisher=[[Butterworth–Heinemann]]|location=Oxford [England]|year=1998|edition=2nd|pages=6–7|isbn=0-7506-4022-7|oclc=40330075|url=https://books.google.com/?id=9dvK2ajv7zIC&amp;lpg=PA10&amp;dq=league%20of%20nations%20tourism%201936&amp;pg=PA6#v=onepage&amp;q=league%20of%20nations%20tourism%201936}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, three schools discuss the roots of 'tourism'. The French School, led by A. Houlot, argues that the term 'tourism' comes from the old Aramaic Tur, which was used for the exploration and movement of people in the Bible. This word was used for the first time when Moses began his expedition to the lands of Canaán.&lt;ref&gt;Houlot, Arthur. (1961). Le Turisme et La Biblie. Revue l´Académie Internationale du Turisme. Monaco.&lt;/ref&gt; Another school of thought, the Onomastic School, considers the origin of the concept not from a linguistic perspective but rather links it to the last name of the French aristocrat Della Tour. According to this school, after Carlos V signed a treaty with England in 1516, in celebration of this event, the future king gave the Della Tour family exclusive rights to conduct commercial transport and related businesses.&lt;ref&gt;Leiper, Neil (1983). An Etymology of Tourism. Annals of Tourism Research (2). New York: Pergamon Press. Volume 10&lt;/ref&gt; A third school focuses on the Anglo-Saxon world, and scrutinises Theobald´s thesis. Surmising that the roots of the word 'tourism' lie in the ancient Anglo-Saxon term Torn, these scholars have found evidence that the term was coined in the 12th century by farmers to denote travel with an intention to return. Over the centuries, the meaning of the word has shifted. By the middle of the 18th century, English noblemen used the term 'turn' to refer to trips undertaken for education and cultural exploration. In reality, the purpose of the noblemen’s trips to the different parts of the kingdom was to acquire knowledge that was later useful for governing.&lt;ref&gt;Korstanje, M. 2007 The Origin and meaning of Tourism: Etymological study. E Review of Tourism Research. Vol 5 (5): 100-108. Texas A&amp;M University, US&lt;/ref&gt;

==Significance of tourism==
[[File:Ahlbeck Strandkörbe 2013.JPG|thumb|[[Strandkorb]] chairs on [[Usedom|Usedom Island]], Germany. Not only the service sector grows thanks to tourism, but also local [[Craft|manufacturers]] (like those producing the strandkorb), [[retail]]ers, the [[Real estate development|real estate sector]] and the general [[City marketing|image of a location]] can benefit a lot.]]
Tourism is an important, even vital, source of income for many countries. Its importance was recognized in the ''Manila Declaration on World Tourism of 1980'' as &quot;an activity essential to the life of nations because of its direct effects on the social, cultural, educational, and economic sectors of national societies and on their international relations.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;unwto1034&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |url=http://www.univeur.org/cuebc/downloads/PDF%20carte/65.%20Manila.PDF |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121120180003/http://www.univeur.org/CMS/UserFiles/65.%20Manila.PDF |archivedate=2012-11-20 |title= Manila Declaration on World Tourism |date= 10 October 1980|pages= 1–4|location=[[Manila]], [[Philippines]]|conference= World Tourism Conference}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tourism brings in large amounts of income into a local economy in the form of payment for [[goods and services]] needed by tourists, accounting for 30% of the world's [[trade]] of services, and 6% of overall [[export]]s of goods and services.&lt;ref name=&quot;pr12027&quot;/&gt; It also creates opportunities for [[employment]] in the [[Tertiary sector of the economy|service sector of the economy]] associated with tourism.&lt;ref name=&quot;WTO2012Highlights&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mkt.unwto.org/sites/all/files/docpdf/unwtohighlights12enlr_1.pdf|title=2012 Tourism Highlights|publisher=UNWTO|accessdate=17 June 2012|date=June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The service industries which benefit from tourism include [[transport|transportation services]], such as [[airline]]s, [[cruise ship]]s, and [[taxicab]]s; [[hospitality service]]s, such as [[lodging|accommodations]], including [[hotel]]s and [[resort]]s; and entertainment venues, such as [[amusement park]]s, [[casino]]s, [[shopping mall]]s, [[music venue]]s, and [[theatre]]s. This is in addition to goods bought by tourists, including souvenirs, clothing and other supplies.

==Definitions==
In 1936, the [[League of Nations]] defined a ''foreign tourist'' as &quot;someone traveling abroad for at least twenty-four hours&quot;. Its successor, the [[United Nations]], amended this definition in 1945, by including a maximum stay of six months.&lt;ref name=&quot;theobald&quot;/&gt;

In 1941, Hunziker and Krapf defined tourism as &quot;the sum of the phenomena and relationships arising from the travel and stay of non-residents, insofar as they do not lead to [[Permanent residency|permanent residence]] and are not connected with any earning activity.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;1941define&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=Grundriß Der Allgemeinen Fremdenverkehrslehre|last1=Hunziker |first1=W|authorlink1=Walter Hunziker|last2=Krapf|first2=K|oclc=180109383|publisher=Polygr. Verl|language=German|location=Zurich|year=1942}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Tourismus-management: Tourismus-marketing Und Fremdenverkehrsplanung|year=1998|publisher=[u.a.] de Gruyter |isbn=3-11-015185-5|last1=Spode|first1=Hasso |authorlink1=Hasso Spode|editor1-first= Günther|editor1-last= Haedrich|location=Berlin|oclc=243881885|language=German|chapter=Geschichte der Tourismuswissenschaft}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1976, the Tourism Society of England's definition was: &quot;Tourism is the temporary, short-term movement of people to [[tourist destination|destinations]] outside the places where they normally live and work and their activities during the stay at each destination. It includes movements for all purposes.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Beaver|first=Allan|title=A Dictionary of Travel and Tourism Terminology|year=2002|publisher=CAB International|isbn=0-85199-582-9|page=313|location=Wallingford|oclc=301675778}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1981, the International Association of Scientific Experts in Tourism defined tourism in terms of particular activities chosen and undertaken outside the home.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The AIEST, its character and aims|url=http://www.aiest.org/org/idt/idt_aiest.nsf/en/index.html|author=International Association of Scientific Experts in Tourism|accessdate=29 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1994, the [[United Nations]] identified three forms of tourism in its ''Recommendations on Tourism Statistics'':&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Recommendations on Tourism Statistics |url=http://unstats.un.org/unsd/newsletter/unsd_workshops/tourism/st_esa_stat_ser_M_83.pdf|work=Statistical Papers|publisher=United Nations|accessdate=12 July 2010|location=New York|year=1994|page=5|series=M|issue=83}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Domestic tourism, involving residents of the given country traveling only within this country
* Inbound tourism, involving non-residents traveling in the given country
* Outbound tourism, involving residents traveling in another country

The terms ''tourism'' and ''travel'' are sometimes used interchangeably. In this context, travel has a similar definition to tourism, but implies a more purposeful journey. The terms ''tourism'' and ''tourist'' are sometimes used pejoratively, to imply a shallow interest in the cultures or locations visited. By contrast, ''traveler'' is often used as a sign of distinction. The sociology of tourism has studied the cultural values underpinning these distinctions and their implications for class relations.&lt;ref&gt;Edensor, T. (1998) Tourists at the Taj. London: Routledge&lt;/ref&gt;

==World tourism statistics and rankings==

===Total volume of cross-border tourist travel===
International tourist arrivals reached 1.035 billion in 2012, up from over 996 million in 2011, and 952 million in 2010.&lt;ref name=Barom2012&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://dtxtq4w60xqpw.cloudfront.net/sites/all/files/pdf/unwto_barom13_01_jan_excerpt_0.pdf|title=UNWTO World Tourism Barometer|publisher=[[World Tourism Organization]]|journal=UNWTO World Tourism Barometer|date=January 2013|volume=11|issue=1|accessdate=2013-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011 and 2012, international [[Travel behavior|travel demand]] continued to recover from the losses resulting from the [[late-2000s recession]], where tourism suffered a strong slowdown from the second half of 2008 through the end of 2009. After a 5% increase in the first half of 2008, growth in international tourist arrivals moved into negative territory in the second half of 2008, and ended up only 2% for the year, compared to a 7% increase in 2007.&lt;ref name=Barom2009&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.unwto.org/facts/eng/pdf/barometer/UNWTO_Barom09_1_en.pdf|title=International tourism challenged by deteriorating global economy|publisher=[[World Tourism Organization]]|journal=UNWTO World Tourism Barometer|date=January 2009|volume=7|issue=1|accessdate=17 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The negative trend intensified during 2009, exacerbated in some countries due to the outbreak of the [[2009 flu pandemic|H1N1 influenza virus]], resulting in a worldwide decline of 4.2% in 2009 to 880 million international tourists arrivals, and a 5.7% decline in international tourism receipts.&lt;ref name=WTOaugust10&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.unwto.org/facts/eng/pdf/barometer/UNWTO_Barom10_update_august_en.pdf|title=UNWTO World Tourism Barometer Interim Update|journal=UNWTO World Tourism Barometer|publisher=[[World Tourism Organization]]|date=August 2010|accessdate=17 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Antiquity===
{{see also|Travel literature}}
Travel outside a person's local area for leisure was largely confined to wealthy classes, who at times travelled to distant parts of the world, to see great buildings, works of art, [[multilingualism|learn new languages]], experience new cultures, and to taste different [[cuisine]]s. As early as [[Shulgi]], however, kings praised themselves for protecting roads and building waystations for travelers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HFWjoeVCLk0C|title=Introduction To Tourism|publisher=|accessdate=9 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Roman Republic]], [[spa]]s and coastal resorts such as [[Baiae]] were popular among the rich. [[Pausanias (geographer)]] wrote his ''Description of Greece'' in the 2nd century AD. In [[ancient China]], nobles sometimes made a point of visiting [[Mount Tai]] and, on occasion, all [[five Sacred Mountains]].

===Middle Ages===
By the [[Middle Ages]], [[Christian pilgrimage|Christianity]], [[Buddhist pilgrimage|Buddhism]], and [[Islam]] all had traditions of [[pilgrimage]] that motivated even the lower classes to undertake distant journeys for health or spiritual improvement, seeing the sights along the way. The Islamic ''[[hajj]]'' is still central to its faith and [[Chaucer]]'s [[Canterbury Tales]] and [[Wu Cheng'en]]'s ''[[Journey to the West]]'' remain classics of [[English literature|English]] and [[Chinese literature]].

The 10th- to 13th-century [[Song dynasty]] also saw secular [[travel literature|travel writers]] such as [[Su Shi]] (11th century) and [[Fan Chengda]] (12th century) become popular in [[China]]. Under the [[Ming dynasty|Ming]], [[Xu Xiake]] continued the practice.&lt;ref&gt;Hargett, James. &quot;Some Preliminary Remarks on the Travel Records of the Song Dynasty (960-1279)&quot; in ''Chinese Literature: Essays, Articles, Reviews'', {{nowrap|Vol. 7}}, {{nowrap|No. 1/2}}, {{nowrap|pp. 67–93}}. 1985. DOI 10.2307/495194. JSTOR 495194.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[medieval Italy]], [[Francesco Petrarch]] also wrote an allegorical account of his 1336 ascent of [[Mount Ventoux]] that praised the act of traveling and criticized ''frigida incuriositas'' (&quot;cold lack curiosity&quot;). The [[Duke of Burgundy|Burgundian]] poet {{Ill|fr|Michault Taillevent}} later composed his own horrified recollections of a 1430 trip through the [[Jura Mountains]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7yqsIYSNmLMC&amp;pg=PA32 | title=Un poète bourguignon du XVe siècle, Michault Taillevent: édition et étude | publisher=Librairie Droz | author=Deschaux, Robert; Taillevent, Michault | year=1975 | pages=31–32}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Grand Tour===
[[Image:Jean Preudhomme.jpg|thumb|Portrait of [[Douglas Douglas-Hamilton, 8th Duke of Hamilton|Douglas, 8th Duke of Hamilton]], on his Grand Tour with his physician [[John Moore (Scottish physician)|Dr John Moore]] and the latter's son [[John Moore (British Army officer)|John]]. Painted by [[Jean Preudhomme]] in 1774.]]
{{See also|Grand Tour}}
Modern tourism can be traced to what was known as the [[Grand Tour]], which was a traditional trip around [[Europe]], (especially [[Germany]] and [[Italy]]), undertaken by mainly [[Upper class|upper-class]] European young men of means, mainly from Western and Northern European countries. The [[Norm (sociology)|custom]] flourished from about 1660 until the advent of large-scale [[rail transport|rail]] transit in the 1840s, and was associated with a standard [[itinerary]]. It served as an educational opportunity and [[rite of passage]]. Though primarily associated with the [[British nobility]] and wealthy [[landed gentry]], similar trips were made by wealthy young men of [[Protestantism|Protestant]] [[Northern Europe]]an nations on the [[Continental Europe|Continent]], and from the second half of the 18th century some South American, US, and other overseas youth joined in. The tradition was extended to include more of the [[middle class]] after rail and steamship travel made the journey less of a burden, and [[Thomas Cook &amp; Son|Thomas Cook]] made the &quot;Cook's Tour&quot; a byword.

The Grand Tour became a real status symbol for upper class students in the 18th and 19th centuries. In this period, Johann Joachim Winckelmann's theories about the supremacy of classic culture became very popular and appreciated in the European academic world. Artists, writers and travellers (such as [[Goethe]]) affirmed the supremacy of classic art of which Italy, France and Greece provide excellent examples. For these reasons, the Grand Tour's main destinations were to those centres, where upper-class students could find rare examples of classic art and history.

''[[The New York Times]]'' recently described the Grand Tour in this way:

{{Quote|text=Three hundred years ago, wealthy young Englishmen began taking a post-[[Oxbridge]] trek through France and Italy in search of art, culture and the roots of [[Western culture|Western civilization]]. With nearly unlimited funds, aristocratic connections and months (or years) to roam, they [[Commission (art)|commissioned paintings]], perfected their language skills and mingled with the upper crust of the Continent.|sign=Gross, Matt.|source=[http://frugaltraveler.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/09/05/lesons-from-the-frugal-grand-tour/index.html Lessons From the Frugal Grand Tour].&quot; ''New York Times'' 5 September 2008.}}

The primary value of the Grand Tour, it was believed, laid in the exposure both to the cultural legacy of [[classical antiquity]] and the [[Renaissance]], and to the aristocratic and fashionably polite society of the European continent.

===Emergence of leisure travel===
{{Refimprove section|date=February 2013}}
[[File:Carl Spitzweg 047.jpg|thumb|''Englishman in the [[Roman Campagna|Campagna]]'' by [[Carl Spitzweg]] (c. 1845)]]

Leisure travel was associated with the [[Industrial Revolution]] in the [[United Kingdom]]{{spaced ndash}}the first European country to promote [[Leisure|leisure time]] to the increasing industrial population.&lt;ref name=&quot;singh&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Singh|first=L. K.|title=Fundamental of Tourism and Travel|year=2008|publisher=Isha Books|location=Delhi|isbn=978-81-8205-478-3|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mWf4PtzRmwUC&amp;lpg=PA189&amp;dq=the%20first%20European%20country%20to%20promote%20leisure%20time%20to%20the%20increasing%20industrial%20population&amp;pg=PA189|page=189|chapter=Issues in Tourism Industry}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially, this applied to the owners of the machinery of production, the economic oligarchy, the factory owners and the traders. These comprised the new [[middle class]].&lt;ref name=&quot;singh&quot;/&gt; [[Cox &amp; Kings]] was the first official travel company to be formed in 1758.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.coxandkings.co.uk/aboutus-history.aspx|title=History: Centuries of Experience|publisher=[[Cox &amp; Kings]]|accessdate=23 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The British origin of this new industry is reflected in many place names. In [[Nice]], [[France]], one of the first and best-established holiday resorts on the [[French Riviera]], the long esplanade along the seafront is known to this day as the ''Promenade des Anglais''; in many other historic resorts in [[continental Europe]], old, well-established palace hotels have names like the ''[[Hotel Bristol]]'', ''Hotel Carlton'', or ''Hotel Majestic''{{spaced ndash}}reflecting the dominance of [[England|English]] customers.

[[Image:Thomas Cook Building, Leicester, panels.jpg|thumb|Panels from the Thomas Cook Building in Leicester, displaying excursions offered by [[Thomas Cook]]]]
[[File:Leicester Rail Station - geograph.org.uk - 1266728.jpg|left|thumb|[[Leicester railway station]] - built in 1894 to replace, largely on the same site, [[Leicester Campbell Street railway station|Campbell Street station]], the origin for many of Cook's early tours.]]
A pioneer of the travel agency business, [[Thomas Cook]]'s idea to offer excursions came to him while waiting for the stagecoach on the London Road at [[Kibworth]]. With the opening of the extended [[Midland Counties Railway]], he arranged to take a group of 540 [[Temperance Movement|temperance]] campaigners from [[Leicester]] [[Leicester Campbell Street railway station|Campbell Street station]] to a rally in [[Loughborough]], eleven miles away. On 5 July 1841, Thomas Cook arranged for the rail company to charge one [[shilling]] per person that included rail tickets and food for this train journey. Cook was paid a share of the fares actually charged to the passengers, as the railway tickets, being legal contracts between company and passenger, could not have been issued at his own price. This was the first privately chartered excursion train to be advertised to the general public; Cook himself acknowledging that there had been previous, unadvertised, private excursion trains.&lt;ref&gt;Ingle, R., 1991 ''Thomas Cook of Leicester'', Bangor, Headstart History&lt;/ref&gt; During the following three summers he planned and conducted outings for temperance societies and Sunday-school children. In 1844 the Midland Counties Railway Company agreed to make a permanent arrangement with him provided he found the passengers. This success led him to start his own business running rail excursions for pleasure, taking a percentage of the railway tickets.

Four years later, he planned his first excursion abroad, when he took a group from Leicester to [[Calais]] to coincide with the [[Paris]] Exhibition. The following year he started his 'grand circular tours' of Europe. During the 1860s he took parties to Switzerland, Italy, Egypt and the United States. Cook established 'inclusive independent travel', whereby the traveller went independently but his agency charged for travel, food and accommodation for a fixed period over any chosen route. Such was his success that the Scottish railway companies withdrew their support between 1862 and 1863 to try the excursion business for themselves.












==Cruise shipping==
[[File:Prinzessin Victoria Luise LOC det.4a15439.jpg|thumb|right|[[Prinzessin Victoria Luise]], the first [[cruise ship]] of the world, launched in June 1900 in [[Hamburg]] (Germany)]]

Leisure [[cruise ship]]s were introduced by the ''[[Peninsular &amp; Oriental Steam Navigation Company]]'' (P&amp;O) in 1844,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://portal.pohub.com/pls/pogprtl/url/ITEM/1E71EC45AF8D6696E0440003BA2CA8EA|title=pohub.com|publisher=|accessdate=9 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; sailing from [[Southampton]] to destinations such as [[Gibraltar]], [[Malta]] and [[Athens]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.btnews.co.uk/article/5037|title=CRUISE NEWS JUNE 2012|accessdate=2012-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1891, German businessman [[Albert Ballin]] sailed the ship [[Augusta Victoria (ship)|''Augusta Victoria'']] from [[Hamburg]] into the Mediterranean Sea. In 1900, one of the first purpose-built cruise ship was ''[[Prinzessin Victoria Luise]]'', built in Hamburg.  Cruising is a popular form of [[water tourism]].

==Modern day tourism==
Many leisure-oriented tourists travel to [[seaside resort]]s at their nearest coast or further apart. Coastal areas in the tropics are popular both in the summer and winter.

===Winter tourism===
{{See also|List of ski areas and resorts|Winter sport}}
[[St. Moritz]], [[Switzerland]] became the cradle of the developing winter tourism in the 1860s; hotel manager Johannes Badrutt invited some summer guests from England to return in the winter to see the snowy landscape, thereby inaugurating a popular trend.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.stmoritz.ch/en/winter/village/spirit-history/birthplace-of-winter-tourism.html|title=Birthplace of winter tourism}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Early Winter Tourism|url=http://www.kulmhotel-stmoritz.ch/en/portrait/tradition-history/early-winter-tourism.html|work=Tradition &amp; History|publisher=Kulm Hotel|accessdate=23 December 2011|location=[[St. Moritz]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was, however, only in the 1970s when winter tourism took over the lead from summer tourism in many of the Swiss ski resorts. Even in winter, up to one third of all guests (depending on the location) consist of non-skiers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.graubuenden.ch/winter-walking-switzerland.html |title=Winter hiking in Switzerland-Graubünden|publisher=graubuenden.ch |accessdate=2011-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Major [[ski resort]]s are located mostly in the various European countries (e.g. [[Andorra]], [[Austria]], [[Bulgaria]], [[Bosnia-Herzegovina]], [[Croatia]], [[Czech Republic]], [[Cyprus]], [[Finland]], [[France]], [[Germany]], [[Iceland]], [[Italy]], [[Norway]], [[Latvia]], [[Lithuania]], [[List of ski areas and resorts in Europe#Poland|Poland]], [[Romania]], [[Serbia]], [[Sweden]], [[Slovakia]], [[Slovenia]], [[Spain]], [[Switzerland]], [[Turkey]]), [[Canada]], the [[United States]] (e.g. Colorado, California, Utah, Montana, Wyoming, New York, New Jersey, Michigan, Vermont, New Hampshire) [[Lebanon]], [[New Zealand]], [[Japan]], [[South Korea]], [[Chile]], and [[Argentina]].

===Mass tourism===
[[File:Adolf Friedrich Erdmann von Menzel 044.jpg|thumb|''Reisepläne'' (''Travel plans'') by [[Adolph Menzel]] (1875)]]

Mass tourism developed with improvements in technology, which allowed the [[transport]] of large numbers of people in a short period of time to places of leisure interest, so that greater numbers of people could begin to enjoy the benefits of leisure time.

In [[Continental Europe]], early [[seaside resort]]s include: [[Heiligendamm]], founded in 1793 at the [[Baltic Sea]], being the first seaside resort; [[Ostend]], popularised by the people of [[Brussels]]; [[Boulogne-sur-Mer]] and [[Deauville]] for the [[Paris]]ians; [[Taormina]] in [[Sicily]].

In the [[United States]], the first seaside resorts in the European style were at [[Atlantic City, New Jersey|Atlantic City]], [[New Jersey]] and [[Long Island]], [[New York]].

=== Niche tourism ===
{{main list|List of adjectival tourisms}}

Niche tourism refers to the numerous specialty travel forms of tourism that have emerged over the years, each with its own adjective. Many of these have come into common use by the tourism industry and academics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lew|first=Alan A.|title=Long Tail Tourism: New geographies for marketing niche tourism products|journal=Journal of Travel &amp; Tourism Marketing|year=2008|volume=25|issue=3-4|pages=409–419|doi=10.1080/10548400802508515|url=http://www.geog.nau.edu/publications/Long-Tail-Tourism-Lew.pdf|accessdate=22 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others are emerging concepts that may or may not gain popular usage. Examples of the more common niche tourism markets include:

==Recent developments==
[[File:Aerial view Yacht Harbour Residence Rostock Yachthafenresidenz Hohe Düne 6.jpg|thumb|A [[destination hotel]] in [[Germany]]: ''Yacht Harbour Residence'' in [[Warnemünde|Rostock]], [[Mecklenburg]].]]
There has been an up-trend in tourism over the last few decades,{{vague|date=November 2013}} especially in Europe, where international travel for short breaks is common. Tourists have a wide range of budgets and tastes, and a wide variety of resorts and hotels have developed to cater for them. For example, some people prefer simple beach vacations, while others want more specialised holidays, quieter resorts, family-oriented holidays or niche market-targeted [[destination hotel]]s.

The developments in technology and transport infrastructure, such as [[Wide-body aircraft|jumbo jets]], [[Low-cost carrier|low-cost airlines]] and more [[accessible tourism|accessible]] [[airport]]s have made many types of tourism more affordable. The [[WHO]] estimated in 2009 that there are around half a million people on board aircraft at any given time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/feedarticle/8477508 Swine flu prompts EU warning on travel to US]. ''The Guardian.'' 28 April 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; There have also been changes in lifestyle, for example some retirement-age people sustain year round tourism. This is facilitated by [[Electronic commerce|internet sales]] of tourist services. Some sites have now started to offer [[dynamic packaging]], in which an inclusive price is quoted for a tailor-made package requested by the customer upon impulse.

There have been a few setbacks in tourism, such as the [[September 11 attacks]] and [[terrorism|terrorist threats]] to [[tourist destination]]s, such as in [[Bali]] and several European cities. Also, on 26 December 2004, a tsunami, caused by the [[2004 Indian Ocean earthquake]], hit the [[List of sovereign states and dependent territories in Asia|Asian countries]] on the [[Indian Ocean]], including the [[Maldives]]. Thousands of lives were lost including many tourists. This, together with the vast [[clean-up]] operations, stopped or severely hampered tourism in the area for a time.

Individual low-price or even zero-price overnight stays have become more popular in the 2000s, especially with a strong growth in the [[hostel]] market and services like [[CouchSurfing]] and [[airbnb]] being established.&lt;ref name=newyorkercouch&gt;{{cite web|last=Marx|first=Patricia|title=Couch-surfing the globe|url=http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2012/04/16/120416fa_fact_marx|publisher=The New Yorker|accessdate=15 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; There has also been examples of jurisdictions wherein a significant portion of GDP is being spent on altering the primary sources of revenue towards tourism, as has occurred for instance in [[Dubai]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cadene|first1=Philippe|title=Atlas of the Gulf States|date=2013|page=29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sustainable tourism===
{{Main|Sustainable tourism}}

&quot;Sustainable tourism is envisaged as leading to management of all resources in such a way that economic, social and aesthetic needs can be fulfilled while maintaining cultural integrity, essential ecological processes, [[Biodiversity|biological diversity]] and life support systems.&quot; ([[World Tourism Organization]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sustainable Tourism: Turning the Tide |url=http://www.stakeholderforum.org/fileadmin/files/SF_Briefing_Papers/bp_tourism.pdf|work=Towards Earth Summit 2002|publisher=[[Stakeholder Forum for a Sustainable Future]]|accessdate=22 January 2012|date=August 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sustainable development]] implies &quot;meeting the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.&quot; ([[Brundtland Commission|World Commission on Environment and Development]], 1987)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Resolution adopted by the General Assembly|url=http://www.un-documents.net/a42r187.htm|work=42/187. Report of the World Commission on Environment and Development|publisher=[[The Conference of NGOs]]|accessdate=21 January 2012|date=11 December 1987}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sustainable tourism can be seen as having regard to ecological and socio-cultural carrying capacities and includes involving the community of the destination in tourism development planning. It also involves integrating tourism to match current economic and growth policies so as to mitigate some of the negative economic and social impacts of 'mass tourism'.  Murphy (1985) advocates the use of an 'ecological approach', to consider both 'plants' and 'people' when implementing the sustainable tourism development process. This is in contrast to the '[[boosterism]]' and '[[economic]]' approaches to tourism planning, neither of which consider the detrimental ecological or sociological impacts of tourism development to a destination.

However, Butler questions the exposition of the term 'sustainable' in the context of tourism, citing its ambiguity and stating that &quot;the emerging sustainable development philosophy of the 1990s can be viewed as an extension of the broader realization that a preoccupation with economic growth without regard to its social and environmental consequences is self-defeating in the long term.&quot; Thus 'sustainable tourism development' is seldom considered as an autonomous function of economic regeneration as separate from general economic growth.

===Ecotourism===
{{Main|Ecotourism}}
Ecotourism, also known as ecological tourism, is responsible travel to fragile, pristine, and usually protected areas that strives to be low-impact and (often) small-scale. It helps educate the traveler; provides funds for conservation; directly benefits the economic development and political empowerment of local communities; and fosters respect for different cultures and for human rights.''Take only memories and leave only footprints'' is a very common slogan in protected areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pinterest.com/marymo393/take-only-memories-leave-only-footprints-chief-sea/|title=Morgan Gamble|work=Pinterest|accessdate=9 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tourist destinations are shifting to low carbon emissions following the trend of visitors more focused in being environmentally responsible adopting a sustainable behavior.&lt;ref&gt;ENTREPRENEURING SUSTAINABLE TOURISM, [[Jack Soifer]] Editor,Lisboa, 2008,isbn 987-989-95976-0-0&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pro-poor tourism===
[[File:Community Tourism (Riven No 2).webm|thumb| Community tourism in Sierra Leone [[Wikibooks:Development Cooperation Handbook/Stories/Community Tourism|→ The story of a community in Sierra Leone trying to manage tourism in a socially responsible manner]]   [[File:Film-Camera.png|17px]]   [http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL32A3F6F949A3F26D Playlist] ]]
Pro-poor tourism, which seeks to help the poorest people in developing countries, has been receiving increasing attention by those involved in development; the issue has been addressed through small-scale projects in local communities and through attempts by Ministries of Tourism to attract large numbers of tourists. Research by the [[Overseas Development Institute]] suggests that neither is the best way to encourage tourists' money to reach the poorest as only 25% or less (far less in some cases) ever reaches the poor; successful examples of money reaching the poor include mountain-climbing in [[Tanzania]] and cultural tourism in [[Luang Prabang]], [[Laos]].&lt;ref name=&quot;odi.org.uk&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.odi.org.uk/resources/details.asp?id=2675&amp;title=value-chains-tourism-poverty-reduction |title=Value chain analysis and poverty reduction at scale  |author=Jonathan Mitchel |year=2009 |work= |publisher=Overseas Development Institute |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Recession tourism===
Recession tourism is a travel trend which evolved by way of the world economic crisis. Recession tourism is defined by low-cost and high-value experiences taking place of once-popular generic retreats. Various recession tourism hotspots have seen business boom during the recession thanks to comparatively low costs of living and a slow world job market suggesting travelers are elongating trips where their money travels further. This concept is not widely used in tourism research. It is related to the short-lived phenomenon that is more widely known as [[staycation]].

===Medical tourism===
{{Main|Medical tourism}}
When there is a significant price difference between countries for a given medical procedure, particularly in [[Southeast Asia]], [[India]], [[Eastern Europe]] and where there are different regulatory regimes, in relation to particular medical procedures (e.g. [[dentistry]]), traveling to take advantage of the price or regulatory differences is often referred to as &quot;medical tourism&quot;.

===Educational tourism===
Educational tourism is developed because of the growing popularity of teaching and learning of knowledge and the enhancing of technical competency outside of classroom environment. In educational tourism, the main focus of the tour or leisure activity includes visiting another country to learn about the culture, study tours, or to work and apply skills learned inside the classroom in a different environment, such as in the International Practicum Training Program.

===Creative tourism===
[[File:FF of Hartwell welcomes Indonesians.jpg|thumb|left|[[Friendship Force International|Friendship Force]] visitors from Indonesia meet their hosts in [[Hartwell, Georgia]], USA.]]
Creative tourism has existed as a form of [[cultural tourism]], since the early beginnings of tourism itself. Its European roots date back to the time of the [[Grand Tour]], which saw the sons of aristocratic families traveling for the purpose of mostly interactive, educational experiences. More recently, creative tourism has been given its own name by Crispin Raymond and Greg Richards,&lt;ref name=&quot;ct&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Wurzburger|first=Rebecca|title=Creative Tourism: A Global Conversation: How to Provide Unique Creative Experiences for Travelers Worldwide: As Presented at the 2008 Santa Fe &amp; UNESCO International Conference on Creative Tourism in Santa Fe, New Mexico, USA|publisher=Sunstone Press|location=Santa Fe|year=2009|isbn=978-0-86534-724-3|oclc=370387178|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; who as members of the Association for Tourism and Leisure Education (ATLAS), have directed a number of projects for the [[European Commission]], including cultural and crafts tourism, known as [[sustainable tourism]]. They have defined &quot;creative tourism&quot; as tourism related to the active participation of travellers in the [[culture]] of the host community, through interactive workshops and informal learning experiences.&lt;ref name=&quot;ct&quot;/&gt;

Meanwhile, the concept of creative tourism has been picked up by high-profile organizations such as [[UNESCO]], who through the [[Creative Cities Network]], have endorsed creative tourism as an engaged, [[authenticity (reenactment)|authentic]] experience that promotes an active understanding of the specific cultural features of a [[Location (geography)|place]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}}

[[File:Greg Richards - Conferencia Turismo Creativo.jpg|thumb|Greg Richards - Conferencia Turismo Creativo]]
More recently, creative tourism has gained popularity as a form of cultural tourism, drawing on active participation by travelers in the culture of the host communities they visit. Several countries offer examples of this type of tourism development, including the United Kingdom, Austria, France, the Bahamas, Jamaica, Spain, Italy and New Zealand.

The growing interest of tourists&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Charlie Mansfield Lecturer in Tourism Management and French |url=http://www.tourismconsumption.org/ |title=JTCaP Tourism Consumption Online Journal |publisher=Tourismconsumption.org |accessdate=2013-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; in this new way to discover a culture regards particularly the operators and branding managers, attentive to the possibility of attracting a quality tourism, highlighting the intangible heritage (craft workshops, cooking classes, etc.) and optimizing the use of existing infrastructure (for example, through the rent of halls and auditorium).

===Experiential Tourism===
[[Experiential travel]] (or &quot;immersion travel&quot;) is one of the major market trends in the modern tourism industry. It is an approach to travelling which focuses on experiencing a country, city or particular place by connecting to its [[history]], people, food and [[culture]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/08/nyregion/your-home-the-new-frontier-for-tourists-in-new-york-city.html?_r=0/ New York Times “New Frontier for Tourists: Your Home”]&lt;/ref&gt;

The term “Experiential Travel” is already mentioned in publications from 1985&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=o_QJAQAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22experiential+travel%22&amp;dq=%22experiential+travel%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=c9hVU6frCqemygG2iYGQCg&amp;ved=0CD0Q6AEwAjj6AQ/|title=Insights in Strategic Retail Management|publisher=|accessdate=9 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; - however it was discovered as a meaningful market trend much later.

===Dark tourism===
{{Main|Dark tourism}}
One emerging area of special interest has been identified by Lennon and Foley (2000)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldwidewords.org/turnsofphrase/tp-dar2.htm|title=Dark Tourism|last=Quinion|first=Michael|date=26 November 2005|work=World Wide Words|accessdate=9 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lennon|first1=J. John |first2=Malcolm|last2=Foley|location=London|title=Dark Tourism|publisher=Continuum|year=2000|isbn=0-8264-5063-6 |oclc=44603703}}&lt;/ref&gt; as [[Dark tourism|&quot;dark&quot; tourism]]. This type of tourism involves visits to &quot;dark&quot; sites, such as battlegrounds, scenes of horrific crimes or acts of [[genocide]], for example: [[Internment|concentration camps]].  Dark tourism remains a small [[niche market]], driven by varied motivations, such as mourning, remembrance, education, macabre curiosity or even entertainment. Its early origins are rooted in fairgrounds and medieval fairs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cooper|first=Chris|title=Tourism: Principles and Practice|publisher=[[Pearson Education]]|location=Harlow|year=2005|edition=3rd|isbn=0-273-68406-X|oclc=466952897|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Philip Stone]] argues that dark tourism is a way of imagining the own death through the real death of others'.&lt;ref&gt;Stone, P. R. (2012). Dark tourism and significant other death: Towards a model of mortality mediation. Annals of Tourism Research, 39(3), 1565-1587.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Erik H Cohen]] introduces the term [[populo sites]] to evidence the educational character of dark tourism. Populo sites transmits the story of vicitimized population to visitors. Based on a study at Yad Vashem, the Shoah (Holocaust) memorial museum in Jerusalem, a new term—in populo—is proposed to describe dark tourism sites at a population and spiritual center of the people to whom a tragedy befell. Learning about the Shoah in Jerusalem offers a different but equally authentic encounter with the subject as visits to sites in Europe. It is argued that a dichotomy between ‘authentic’ sites at the location of a tragedy and ‘created’ sites elsewhere is insufficient. Participants’ evaluations of seminars for European teachers at Yad Vashem indicate that the location is an important aspect of a meaningful encounter with the subject. Implications for other cases of dark tourism at in populo locations are discussed.&lt;ref&gt;Cohen, E. H. (2011). Educational dark tourism at an in populo site: The Holocaust museum in Jerusalem. Annals of Tourism Research, 38(1), 193-209.&lt;/ref&gt; In this vein, [[Peter Tarlow]] defines dark tourism as the tendency to visit places where tragedies, or historically noteworthy death happened, which continues to impressing our lives. This issue cannot be understood without the figure of trauma.&lt;ref&gt;Tarlow, P. E. (2007). Dark tourism. Niche Tourism, 47.&lt;/ref&gt; Following this, [[Maximiliano Korstanje]] explains that tourism serves as an scape-goat mechanism used in order for society does not collapse. This is the reason why tourists look for something special, something new beyond their nearest residential home. The quest for &quot;Otherness&quot; leads not only to maximize pleasure but also provides a pedagogical message to the us. In context of disasters and tragedies, dark tourism may revitalize the lost trust giving a positive value that helps community in the process of recovery. Tourism is in fact an instrument of resiliency that paves the ways for the society to be united.&lt;ref&gt;Korstanje M (2015) &quot;The Anthropology of Dark Tourism&quot;. CERS Centre for Ethnicity and Racism Studies. University of Leeds, UK Working Paper 22&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Korstanje, M. E. (2011). Detaching the elementary forms of dark-tourism. Anatolia, 22(3), 424-427.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Korstanje, M. E., &amp; Ivanov, S. (2012). Tourism as a form of new psychological resilience: The inception of dark tourism. CULTUR-Revista de Cultura e Turismo, 6(4), 56-71.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social tourism===
Social tourism is the extension of the benefits of tourism to disadvantaged people who otherwise could not afford to travel for their education of recreation. It includes [[youth hostels]] and low-priced holiday accommodation run by church and [[voluntary organisation]]s, [[trade unions]], or in Communist times [[combine (enterprise)|publicly owned enterprises]]. In May 1959, at the second Congress of Social Tourism in Austria, [[Walter Hunziker#Social tourism|Walter Hunziker]] proposed the following definition: “Social tourism is a type of tourism practiced by low income groups, and which is rendered possible and facilitated by entirely separate and therefore easily recognizable services&quot;.

===Doom tourism===
[[File:Perito Moreno Glacier Patagonia Argentina Luca Galuzzi 2005.JPG|thumb|[[Perito Moreno Glacier]], [[Patagonia]], [[Argentina]].]]

Also known as &quot;Tourism of Doom,&quot; or &quot;Last Chance Tourism&quot; this emerging trend involves traveling to places that are environmentally or otherwise threatened (such as the ice caps of [[Mount Kilimanjaro]], the melting glaciers of [[Patagonia]], or the coral of the [[Great Barrier Reef]]) before it is too late. Identified by travel trade magazine [[Travel Age West]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Shapiro |first=Kenneth |url=http://www.travelagewest.com/Travel-News/Viewpoint/The-Tourism-of-Doom/ |title=TravelAge West – TravelAge West |publisher=Travelagewest.com |date=2007-05-11 |accessdate=2012-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; editor-in-chief Kenneth Shapiro in 2007 and later explored in [[The New York Times]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Salkin |first=Allen |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/16/world/americas/16iht-tourism.1.8762449.html |title='Tourism of doom' on rise - The New York Times |publisher=Nytimes.com |date=2007-12-16 |accessdate=2012-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; this type of tourism is believed to be on the rise. Some see the trend as related to [[sustainable tourism]] or [[ecotourism]] due to the fact that a number of these tourist destinations are considered threatened by environmental factors such as global warming, overpopulation or climate change. Others worry that travel to many of these threatened locations increases an individual’s [[carbon footprint]] and only hastens problems threatened locations are already facing.&lt;ref&gt;Lemelin, H., Dawson, J., &amp; Stewart, E. J. (Eds.). (2013). Last chance tourism: adapting tourism opportunities in a changing world. Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Frew, E. (2008).

H., Koster, R. L., &amp; Youroukos, N. (2013). 8 Last chance tourism?. Last Chance Tourism: Adapting Tourism Opportunities in a Changing World, 105.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Growth==
The [[World Tourism Organization]] (UNWTO) forecasts that international tourism will continue growing at the average annual rate of 4%.&lt;ref name=&quot;predict&quot;&gt;{{cite web | year = 2004| url = http://www.world-tourism.org/market_research/facts/market_trends.htm  | title =Long-term Prospects: Tourism 2020 Vision | publisher = World Tourism}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the advent of [[electronic commerce|e-commerce]], tourism products have become one of the most traded items on the internet. {{Citation needed|date=June 2008}} Tourism products and services have been made available through intermediaries, although tourism providers (hotels, airlines, etc.), including small-scale operators, can sell their services directly.&lt;ref&gt;Lu, J., &amp; Lu, Z. (2004). Development, Distribution and Evaluation of Online Tourism Services in China. Electronic Commerce Research, 4(3), 221-239.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Karanasios, S., &amp; Burgess, S. (2008). Tourism and Internet adoption: a developing world perspective. International Journal of Tourism Research, 10(2), 169-182.&lt;/ref&gt; This has put pressure on intermediaries from both on-line and traditional shops.

It has been suggested there is a strong correlation between tourism expenditure per capita and the degree to which countries play in the global context.&lt;ref name=&quot;correl&quot;&gt;{{cite web | year = 2007| url = http://global-culture.org/blog/2007/01/27/airports-tourists/  | title =airports &amp; tourists | publisher = Global Culture}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Not only as a result of the important economic contribution of the tourism industry, but also as an indicator of the degree of confidence with which global citizens leverage the resources of the globe for the benefit of their [[Community-based economics|local economies]].  This is why any projections of growth in tourism may serve as an indication of the relative influence that each country will exercise in the future.

[[File:White Knight Two and SpaceShipTwo from directly below.jpg|thumb|right|[[SpaceShipTwo]] is a major project in [[space tourism]].]]

===Space tourism===
{{Main|Space tourism}}

There has been a limited amount of orbital [[space tourism]], with only the [[Russian Space Agency]] providing transport to date. A 2010 report into space tourism anticipated that it could become a billion dollar market by 2030.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Economic Impact of Commercial Space Transportation on the U. S Economy in 2009|url=http://www.faa.gov/news/updates/media/Economic%20Impact%20Study%20September%202010_20101026_PS.pdf|accessdate=May 5, 2012|publisher=Federal Aviation Administration|date=September 2010|page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sports tourism===
{{Main|Sports tourism}}

Since the late 1980s, [[sports tourism]] has become increasingly popular. Events such as rugby, Olympics, Commonwealth games, Asian Games and football World Cups have enabled specialist travel companies to gain official ticket allocation and then sell them in packages that include flights, hotels and excursions.
[[File:Tourism Police of Colombia at Cañon del Chicamocha National Park 2013-11-05 00-24.jpg|thumb|right|[[National Police of Colombia|Tourism Police of Colombia]] at the [[Chicamocha National Park]], [[Santander department|Santander]].]]

The focus on sport and spreading knowledge on the subject, especially more so recently, lead to the increase in the sport tourism. Most notably, the international event such as the Olympics caused a shift in focus in the audience who now realize the variety of sports that exist in the world. In the United States, one of the most popular sports that usually are focused on was Football. This popularity was increased through major events like the World Cups. In Asian countries, the numerous football events also increased the popularity of football. But, it was the Olympics that brought together the different sports that lead to the increase in sport tourism. The drastic interest increase in sports in general and not just one sport caught the attention of travel companies, who then began to sell flights in packages. Due to the low number of people who actually purchase these packages than predicted, the cost of these packages plummeted initially. As the number start to rise slightly the packages increased to regain the lost profits. With the certain economic state, the number of purchases decreased once again. The fluctuation in the number of packages sold was solely dependent on the economic situation, therefore, most travel companies were forced to set aside the plan to execute the marketing of any new package features.

===Latest trends===
As a result of the [[late-2000s recession]], international arrivals suffered a strong slowdown beginning in June 2008.  Growth from 2007 to 2008 was only 3.7% during the first eight months of 2008. This slowdown on international tourism demand was also reflected in the air transport industry, with a negative growth in September 2008 and a 3.3% growth in passenger traffic through September. The hotel industry also reported a slowdown, with room occupancy declining. In 2009 worldwide tourism arrivals decreased by 3.8%.&lt;ref name=&quot;UNWTO&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=UNWTO|title=UNWTO Tourism Highlights|url=http://mkt.unwto.org/sites/all/files/docpdf/unwtohighlights11enhr_1.pdf|format=PDF|publisher=UNWTO|accessdate=May 2, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the first quarter of 2009, real travel demand in the United States had fallen 6% over six quarters. While this is considerably milder than what occurred after the [[September 11 attacks|9/11 attacks]], the decline was at twice the rate as real GDP has fallen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://journalistsresource.org/studies/economics/commerce/tourism-impacts-world-economic-crisis-north-america/ | title=Impacts of the World Recession and Economic Crisis on Tourism: North America}} JournalistsResource.org.

However, evidence suggests that tourism as a global phenomenon shows no signs of substantially abating in the long term.  It has been suggested that travel is necessary in order to maintain relationships, as social life is increasingly networked and conducted at a distance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Urry|first=John|title=Social Networks, Travel and Talk|journal=British Journal of Sociology|year=2003|volume=54|issue=2|pages=155–175|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1080/0007131032000080186/abstract;jsessionid=2646A3EE49C305EDB4618B45C3C073DD.d01t01|doi=10.1080/0007131032000080186}}&lt;/ref&gt; For many people vacations and travel are increasingly being viewed as a necessity rather than a luxury, and this is reflected in tourist numbers recovering some 6.6% globally over 2009, with growth up to 8% in emerging economies.&lt;ref name=&quot;UNWTO&quot;/&gt;

A '''wedding''' is a [[ceremony]] where two people are united in [[marriage]]. [[Wedding tradition]]s and customs vary greatly between [[culture]]s, [[ethnic group]]s, religions, countries, and [[social class]]es. Most wedding ceremonies involve an exchange of [[Marriage vows|wedding vows]] by the couple, presentation of a gift (offering, ring(s), symbolic item, flowers, money), and a public proclamation of marriage by an authority figure. Special wedding garments are often worn, and the ceremony is sometimes followed by a [[wedding reception]]. Music, poetry, prayers or readings from [[religious text]]s or literature are also commonly incorporated into the ceremony.

[[File:Edmund Blair Leighton - signing the register.jpg|thumb|||Many cultures have adopted the traditional Western custom of the [[white wedding]], when the [[bride]] wears a white [[wedding dress]] and [[veil]]. Painting by [[Edmund Leighton]] (1853–1922)]]

A number of cultures have adopted the traditional Western custom of the [[white wedding]], in which a [[bride]] wears a white [[wedding dress]] and [[veil]]. This tradition was popularized through the wedding of [[Queen Victoria]]. Some say Victoria's choice of a white gown may have simply been a sign of extravagance, but may have also been influenced by the values she held which emphasized [[Chastity|sexual purity]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Otnes 2003 p.31&quot;&gt;Otnes, Cele &amp; Pleck, Elizabeth (2003). ''Cinderella Dreams: the Allure of the Lavish Wedding'', p. 31. University of California Press, Berkeley.&lt;/ref&gt; Within the modern 'white wedding' tradition, a white dress and veil are unusual choices for a woman's second or subsequent wedding.

The use of a [[wedding ring]] has long been part of religious weddings in Europe and America, but the origin of the tradition is unclear. One possibility is the Roman belief in the [[Vena Amoris]], which was believed to be a blood vessel that ran from the fourth finger (ring finger) directly to the heart, thus when a couple wore rings on this finger their hearts were connected. Historian Vicki Howard points out that the belief in the &quot;ancient&quot; quality of the practice is most likely a modern invention.&lt;ref&gt;Howard, Vicky (2006). ''Brides Inc.: American Weddings and the Business of Tradition'', p. 34. University of Pennsylvania Press, Philadelphia.&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;Double ring&quot; ceremonies are also a modern practice, a groom's wedding band not appearing in the United States until the early 20th century.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated61&quot;&gt;Howard, Vicky (2006). ''Brides Inc.: American Weddings and the Business of Tradition'', p. 61. University of Pennsylvania Press, Philadelphia.&lt;/ref&gt;

The wedding ceremony is often followed by [[wedding reception]] or a [[wedding breakfast]], in which the rituals may include speeches from the groom, best man, father of the bride and possibly the bride,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rhymingspeeches.com/bridespeech ] {{wayback|url=http://www.rhymingspeeches.com/bridespeech |date=20120814003503 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the newlyweds' [[First dance#Weddings|first dance]] as a couple, and the cutting of an elegant [[wedding cake]].

==Wedding music==
{{Main|Wedding music}}
{{listen|filename=Wagner_Bridal_Chorus.ogg|title=Bridal march|description=The [[Bridal Chorus]] from [[Richard Wagner]]'s opera [[Lohengrin (opera)|Lohengrin]]}}

===Western weddings===
[[Wedding music|Music]] played at Western weddings includes a [[Processional hymn|processional]] song for walking down the aisle (ex: wedding march) either before or after the marriage service. An example of such use is reported in the [[wedding of Nora Robinson and Alexander Kirkman Finlay]] in 1878.&lt;ref name= QA1408&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article30673943 |title=Marriage of Mr A.K. Finlay and Miss Robinson |newspaper=[[The Queanbeyan Age]] |location=NSW |date=14 August 1878 |accessdate=4 September 2013 |page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Relevant music includes:

*Various works for trumpet and organ, arguably the most famous of which include the [[Prince of Denmark's March]] by [[Jeremiah Clarke]] as a processional, the &quot;Trumpet Tune&quot; by [[Henry Purcell]] and the &quot;[[Trumpet Voluntary]]&quot; by [[John Stanley (composer)|John Stanley]] as [[Recessional hymn|recessionals]].
*Selections by [[George Frideric Handel]], perhaps most notably the &quot;Air&quot; from his [[Water Music (Handel)|Water Music]] as processional and the &quot;Alla Hornpipe&quot; as recessional.
*The &quot;[[Bridal Chorus]]&quot; from ''[[Lohengrin (opera)|Lohengrin]]'' by [[Richard Wagner]], often used as the processional and commonly known as &quot;Here Comes the Bride&quot;. Richard Wagner is said to have been [[Antisemitism|anti-Semitic]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Cooke |first=Deryck V. |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/633925/Richard-Wagner |title=Richard Wagner &amp;#124; German composer |publisher=Britannica.com |date= |accessdate=2015-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; and as a result, the Bridal Chorus is often not used at Jewish weddings.
*[[Johann Pachelbel]]'s [[Pachelbel's Canon|Canon in D]] is an alternative processional.
*The &quot;[[Wedding March (Mendelssohn)|Wedding March]]&quot; from [[Felix Mendelssohn]]'s [[incidental music]] for the [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]] play, ''[[A Midsummer Night's Dream]]'', used as a recessional.
*The &quot;Toccata&quot; from [[Charles-Marie Widor]]'s ''[[Symphony for Organ No. 5 (Widor)|Symphony for Organ No. 5]]'', used as a recessional.
*Segments of the [[Ode to Joy]], the fourth movement of [[Ludwig van Beethoven]]'s [[Symphony No. 9 (Beethoven)|Ninth Symphony]].
* Other alternative considerations include various contemporary melodies like Bob Marley's One Love which is often performed by a steel drum band.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated61&quot;/&gt;

==Religious aspects of weddings==
{{Cleanup-rewrite|the intro to this section is about marriage, and needs to be rewritten to discuss weddings ceremonies and traditions instead, as does the section on Christian customs. A large amount of info in the section on Jewish customs is commented out and needs to be incorporated. Sections on other religious customs such as Islamic and Shinto weddings would also be helpful|section|date=May 2009}}

Most religions recognize a lifelong union with established ceremonies and [[ritual]]s. Some religions permit [[Polygamy|polygamous]] marriages or [[same-sex marriage]]s.
 
Many Christian faiths emphasize the raising of children as a priority in a marriage. In [[Judaism]], marriage is so important that remaining unmarried is deemed unnatural.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}} [[Islam]] also recommends marriage highly; among other things, it helps in the pursuit of spiritual perfection.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}} The [[Bahá'í Faith]] sees [[Bahá'í marriage|marriage]] as a foundation of the structure of society, and considers it both a physical and spiritual bond that endures into the [[afterlife]].&lt;ref name=&quot;oneworld&quot;&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=Smith |first=Peter |encyclopedia=A concise encyclopedia of the Bahá'í Faith |title=Marriage |year=2000 |publisher=Oneworld Publications |location=Oxford |isbn=1-85168-184-1 |pages=232–233}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hinduism]] sees marriage as a sacred duty that entails both religious and social obligations.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}} By contrast, [[Buddhism]] does not [[Buddhist view of marriage|encourage or discourage marriage]], although it does teach how one might live a happily married life and emphasizes that marital vows are not to be taken lightly{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}.

Different religions have different beliefs as regards the [[divorce|breakup of marriage]]. For example, the Roman Catholic Church believes that marriage is a [[sacrament]] and a valid marriage between two [[Baptism|baptized]] persons cannot be broken by any other means than death. This means that civil divorcés cannot remarry in a Catholic marriage while their spouse is alive. In the area of [[Conflict of nullity laws|nullity]], religions and the state often apply different rules. A couple, for example, may begin the process to have their marriage [[Annulment|annulled]] by the Catholic Church only after they are no longer married in the eyes of the civil authority.

===Customs associated with various religions and cultures===
====Christian customs====
{{Main|Christian views on marriage}}
[[Image:Arab Christian wedding party.jpg|thumb|upright=1|right|[[Arab Christian]] wedding party.]]
[[File:Catholic wedding.jpg|thumb|upright=1|left|A couple exchange vows on the church altar during a ceremony in a [[Catholic Church]].]]
Most [[Christianity|Christian]] churches give some form of blessing to a marriage; the wedding ceremony typically includes some sort of pledge by the community to support the couple's relationship. A ''church wedding'' is a ceremony presided over by a Christian [[priest]] or pastor. Ceremonies are based on reference to [[God]], and are frequently embodied into other church ceremonies such as [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.holyspiritchurch.com/weddingarr.htm |title=Wedding arrangements |publisher=Web.archive.org |date=2008-06-23 |accessdate=2015-11-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/20081216084708/http://www.holyspiritchurch.com:80/weddingarr.htm |archivedate=December 16, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Customs may vary widely between denominations. In the Roman Catholic Church &quot;Holy Matrimony&quot; is considered to be one of [[Sacraments of the Catholic Church|the seven sacraments]], in this case one that the spouses bestow upon each other in front of a priest and members of the community as witnesses. As with all sacraments, it is seen as having been instituted by [[Jesus]] himself (see [[Gospel of Matthew]] 19:1-2, [[Catechism of the Catholic Church]] §1614-1615). In the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]], it is one of the [[Sacred mysteries|Mysteries]], and is seen as an ordination and a martyrdom. The wedding ceremony of [[Saint Thomas Christians]], an ethnoreligious group of Christians in India incorporate elements from Hindu, [[Jewish wedding|Jewish]] and Christian weddings.

=====Quaker customs=====
{{Main|Quaker wedding}}
A [[Quaker wedding]] ceremony in a [[Quakers|Friends]] meeting is similar to any other [[meeting for worship]], and therefore often very different from the experience expected by non-Friends.

====Hindu customs====
{{Main|Hindu wedding}}

[[File:Gaye holud2 JBI.jpg|thumb|left|A girl with traditional gift of Gaye holud.]]
[[File:Rajput wedding riding3.jpg|thumb|Bridegroom arrives on horseback at a [[Rajput]] wedding]]
Hindu ceremonies are usually conducted totally or at least partially in [[Sanskrit]], the language of the [[Hindu texts|Hindu scriptures]]. The wedding celebrations may last for several days and they can be extremely diverse, depending upon the region, denomination and [[caste]]. [[Mehendi]] ceremony is a traditional ritual in Hindu weddings, where [[Henna]] application takes place on bride's hands and legs, before the wedding. On the wedding day, the bride and the bridegroom garland each other in front of the guests. Most guests witness only this short ceremony and then socialize, have food and leave. The religious part (if applicable) comes hours later, witnessed by close friends and relatives. In cases where a religious ceremony is present, a [[Brahmin]] (Hindu priest) arranges a sacred ''[[yajna]]'' (fire-sacrifice), and the sacred fire ([[Agni]]) is considered the prime witness (''[[Sakshi (Witness)|sākshī]]'') of the marriage. He chants [[mantra]]s from the [[Vedas]] and subsidiary texts while the couple are seated before the fire. The most important step is ''[[saptapadi]]'' or ''saat phere'', wherein the bride and the groom, hand-in-hand, encircle the sacred fire seven times, each circle representing a matrimonial vow. Then the groom marks the bride's hair parting with [[vermilion]] (''[[sindoor]]'') and puts a gold necklace (''[[mangalsutra]]'') around her neck. Several other rituals may precede or follow these afore-mentioned rites. Then the bride formally departs from her blood-relatives to join the groom's family.

====Jewish customs====
[[File:MinhagYerushalayim3909.JPG|thumb||Jewish wedding]]
{{Main|Jewish wedding|Jewish views on marriage}}
A traditional Jewish wedding usually follows this format:&lt;ref name=&quot;Aish&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aish.com/literacy/lifecycle/Guide_to_the_Jewish_Wedding.asp|title= Guide to the Jewish Wedding|accessdate=2008-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;My Jewish Learning&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.myjewishlearning.com/life/Life_Events/Weddings/Liturgy_Ritual_and_Custom/Nissuin.shtml|title= Nissuin: The Second of the Two Ceremonies|accessdate=2008-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Understanding the Jewish Wedding&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rebgoldie.com/Wedding.htm |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070921063911/http://www.rebgoldie.com/Wedding.htm |archivedate=2007-09-21|title=Understanding the Jewish Wedding |accessdate=2008-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;The Knot&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://wedding.theknot.com/wedding-planning/wedding-ceremony/articles/jewish-wedding-ceremony-rituals.aspx|title= Ceremony: Jewish Wedding Rituals |accessdate=2008-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Jewish Art&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jhom.com/lifecycle/marriage/art.htm|title= Marriage in Jewish Art|accessdate=2008-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*Before the ceremony, the couple formalize a written ''[[ketubah]]'' (marriage contract), specifying the obligations of husband to the wife and contingencies in case of divorce. The ''ketubah'' is signed by two witnesses and later read under the [[chuppah]].
*The couple is married under a wedding canopy (chuppah), signifying their new home together. The chuppah can be made from a piece of cloth or other material attached to four poles, or a prayer shawl ([[tallit]]) held over the couple by four family members or friends.
*The couple is accompanied to the chuppah by both sets of parents, and stands under the chuppah along with other family members if desired.
*Seven blessings are recited, blessing the bride and groom and their new home.
*The couple sip from a glass of wine.
*The groom will step on the glass to crush it, usually with his right foot, ostensibly in remembrance of the destruction of the Second Temple.
*At some weddings the couple may declare that each is sanctified to the other, and/or repeat other vows, and exchange rings.
**In Orthodox and traditional Jewish weddings, the bride does not speak under the chuppah and only she receives a ring. The groom recites &quot;Harei at mekudeshet li k'dat Moshe V'Yisrael&quot;- &quot;behold you are [thus] sanctified to me by the [[Torah|law of Moses]] and Israel&quot; as he places the ring on the bride's right index finger. The bride's silence and acceptance of the ring signify her agreement to the marriage. This part of the ceremony is called [[Nashim|kiddushin]]. The groom's giving an object of value to the bride is necessary for the wedding to be valid.
**In more egalitarian weddings, the bride responds verbally, often giving the groom a ring in return. A common response is &quot;ani l'dodi, v'dodi li&quot; (I am my beloved's, my beloved is mine)
*In some Orthodox weddings, the groom then says:
:''&quot;If I forget you, O Jerusalem, may my right hand forget its skill.
:''May my tongue cling to the roof of my mouth.
:''If I do not remember you,
:''if I do not consider Jerusalem in my highest joy.&quot;
*The ceremony ends with the groom breaking a glass underfoot.
*The couple spend their first moments as man and wife in seclusion (apart from the wedding guests, and with no other person present). This ''cheder yichud'' - &quot;the room of seclusion (or 'oneness')&quot; [[Halakha|halachically]] strengthens the marriage bond, since Jews are traditionally forbidden to be secluded with an unrelated person of the opposite sex.
*The ceremony is followed by a ''[[seudat mitzvah]]'', the wedding meal, as well as music and dancing.
*At the conclusion of the wedding meal, ''[[Birkat Hamazon]]'' (Grace After Meals) is recited, as well as the seven wedding blessings.

In more observant communities, the couple will celebrate for seven more days, called the ''[[Sheva Brachot]]'' (seven blessings) during which the seven wedding blessings are recited at every large gathering during this time.

==== Muslim cultures ====
{{Main|Marriage in Islam|Islamic marital practices}}
[[File:JBI Gallery (61).jpg|thumb|left|upright|Bridal Portrait]]
[[File:Djerba Henné et Harkous.JPG|thumb|Henna on the hands of a bride in [[Tunisia]]]]
[[File:Kazakh wedding 3.jpg|thumb|A [[Kazakhs|Kazakh]] wedding ceremony in a mosque]]
A wedding is always a happy time for families to celebrate{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}. In the [[Muslim world]], there are colorful, cultural variations from place to place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://islam.about.com/od/marriage/a/worldweddings.htm|title=Islamic Wedding Party Customs|last=Dodge|first=Christine Huda|publisher=About.com|accessdate=8 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two male witnesses who are the members of family in most cases, are required for Nikah. According to the [[Quran]], a married [[Muslim]] couple, both husband and wife act as each other’s protector and comforter and therefore only meant &quot;for each other&quot;.

All Muslim marriages have to be declared publicly and are never to be undertaken in secret. For many Muslims, it is the ceremony that counts as the actual wedding alongside a confirmation of that wedding in a registry office according to ''[[fiqh]]'', in Islam a wedding is also viewed as [[Islamic marriage contract|a legal contract]] particularly in Islamic jurisprudences. However, most Muslim cultures separate both the institutions of the [[mosque]] and marriage, no religious official is necessary, but very often an [[Imam]] presides and performs the ceremony, he may deliver a short sermon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/islam/ritesrituals/weddings_1.shtml |title=Religions - Islam: Weddings |publisher=BBC |date= |accessdate=2015-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Islam, [[polygyny]] is allowed with certain religious restrictions, despite that an overwhelming majority of Muslims traditionally practice [[monogamy]].

It is forbidden in [[Islam]] for parents or anyone else: to [[Forced marriage|force, coerce, or trick]] either man or woman into a marriage that is contrary to the individual will of any one of the couple. It is also necessary for all marriages commence with the best of intentions.

====Chinese cultures====
[[File:Traditional Chinese wedding ceremony.jpg|thumb|In traditional Chinese wedding ceremonies, bride arrives in a ''[[litter (vehicle)|jiao]]'']]
At [[Chinese marriage|traditional Chinese weddings]], the [[tea ceremony]] is the equivalent of an exchange of vows at a Western wedding ceremony. This ritual is still practiced widely among rural Chinese, however young people in larger cities, as well as in Taiwan, Hong Kong, Malaysia and Singapore, tend to practice a combination of Western style of marriage together with the Tea Ceremony.

When the bride leaves her home with the groom to his house, a &quot;Good Luck Woman&quot; will hold a red umbrella over her head, meaning &quot;raise the bark, spread the leaves.&quot; This &quot;good luck woman&quot; should be someone who is blessed with a good marriage, healthy children and husband and living parents. Other relatives will scatter rice, red bean and green bean in front of her. The red umbrella protects the bride from evil spirit, and the rice and beans are to attract the attention of the gold chicken.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}

Newlyweds kneel in front of parents presenting tea. A Good Luck Woman making the tea says auspicious phrases to bless the family. Newlyweds also present tea to each other, raising the tea cups high to show respect before presenting to each other.

Those who receive the tea usually give the bride gifts such as jewelry or [[red envelope]].

Tea Ceremony is an official ritual to introduce the newlyweds to each other's family, and it's a way for newlyweds to show respect and appreciation to their parents. The newlyweds kneel in front of their parents, serving tea to both side of parents, as well as elder close relatives. Parents give their words of blessing and gifts to the newlyweds. During tea presentation, a &quot;Good Luck Woman&quot; would say auspicious phrases to bless the newlyweds and the parents. These auspicious words of blessing are designed to bless and amuse the family and make the occasion filled with fun and joy.

==Humanist weddings==
Many traditions and rituals have origins in religions and are still performed by religious leaders. Those having a secular wedding often want to maintain the symbolic meaning of some customs since they have become an essential part of the culture independent of religion. In order to satisfy these needs, secular ceremonies have started to be carried out by [[humanist officiant]]s worldwide. Since the early 1980s, the [[Humanist Society Scotland]] (HSS) has been carrying out secular ceremonies in the country. In 1987, the BBC Scotland TV series “High Spirits” for the first time aired a humanist wedding on national TV. The demand for humanist wedding has been growing since then and in 2005 HSS won a legal battle and their ceremonies are now authorized by the Registrar General of Scotland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.humanism-scotland.org.uk/content/hss_history/ |title=Humanist Society Scotland &amp;#124; Celebrate the one life we have |publisher=Humanism-scotland.org.uk |date=2015-08-28 |accessdate=2015-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Humanist wedding ceremonies are carried out in a variety of countries like the [[United States|U.S.]], [[Canada]] and recently [[Brazil]], having legal status in only a few of these countries. Humanist celebrants are able to perform valid civil marriages and civil partnerships in the [[Republic of Ireland]].

==Wedding types==
===Civil wedding===
[[Image:Mixed-couple.jpg|thumb|upright|A 2004 California wedding between a Filipina bride and a Nigerian groom.]]
A ''civil wedding'' is a ceremony presided over by a local [[civil authority]], such as an elected or appointed [[judge]], [[Justice of the peace|Justice of the Peace]] or the [[mayor]] of a locality. Civil wedding ceremonies may use references to God or a [[deity]] (except in UK law where readings and music are also restricted),&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://celebratewithmusic.co.uk/songs-you-cant-have-at-a-civil-ceremony/ | publisher = Wedding Music Designer (Simon Jordan) | type = article | title = Music Not Allowed at Civil Ceremonies | contribution = England and Wales}}&lt;/ref&gt; but generally no references to a particular religion or [[religious denomination|denomination]]. They can be either elaborate or simple. Many civil wedding ceremonies take place in local town or city halls or courthouses in judges' chambers.&lt;ref&gt;Gavira, Juan. [http://www.juangavira.com/mariajo-y-manu-salto-de-la-novia/ &quot;Characteristics of a spanish wedding&quot;]. Juangavira.com&lt;/ref&gt;

===Destination wedding===
Not to be confused with an elopement, a ''destination wedding'' is one in which a wedding is hosted, often in a vacation-like setting, at a location to which most of the invited guests must travel and often stay for several days. This could be a beach ceremony in the tropics, a lavish event in a metropolitan resort, or a simple ceremony at the home of a geographically distant friend or relative. During the recession of 2009, destination weddings continued to see growth compared to traditional weddings, as the typically smaller size results in lower costs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Parsons |first=Claudia |url=http://www.reuters.com/article/2009/05/12/us-economy-weddings-idUSTRE54B70020090512 |title=Destination weddings see growth despite recession |publisher=Reuters |date=2009-05-12 |accessdate=2015-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Weddings held a prestigious venues such as castles or stately homes have become increasingly popular in the 21st century particularly in European countries such as the UK, France and Germany.

===Double wedding===
A ''double wedding'' is a double ceremony where two [[Engagement|affianced]] couples rendezvous for two simultaneous or consecutive weddings. Typically, a fiancé with a [[sibling]] who is also engaged, or four close friends in which both couples within the friendship are engaged might plan a double wedding where both couples legally marry.

===Dutch wedding===
A Dutch wedding is much like a conventional wedding. However, the guest list is typically double that of an average wedding, yet still under the same budget. {{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

===Elopement===
''[[Elopement (marriage)|Elopement]]'' is the act of getting married, often unexpectedly, without inviting guests to the wedding. In some cases a small group of family and/or friends may be present, while in others, the engaged couple may marry without the consent and/or knowledge of parents or others. While the couple may or may not be widely known to be engaged prior to the elopement, the wedding itself is generally a surprise to those who are later informed of its occurrence.

===Handfasting===
A handfasting is an old Pagan custom, dating back to the time of the ancient Celts. A handfasting was originally more like an engagement period, where two people would declare a binding union between themselves for a year and a day. The original handfasting was a trial marriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.handfastings.org/abouthandfastings.htm |title=About Handfastings |publisher=Handfastings.org |date= |accessdate=2015-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Highland or Scottish wedding===
[[Image:Scotland Wedding.jpg|thumb|upright|The groom and one other in the wedding party wear a [[kilt]] with [[Argyll jacket]] and long tie.]]
A ''Highland or Scottish wedding'' has the groom, with some or all of the groom's men wear a [[kilt]]. The bride may wear a sash or other tartan clothing. The Scottish basket sword is used for any [[Saber Arch]]. 

===Mass wedding===
A [[Collective wedding|''collective'' or ''mass'' wedding]] is a single ceremony where numerous couples are married simultaneously.

===Military wedding===

A ''military wedding'' is a ceremony conducted in a military chapel and may involve a [[Saber Arch]]. In most military weddings the bride, groom, or both will wear a [[Military uniform|military dress uniform]] in lieu of civilian formal wear. Some retired military personnel who marry after their service has ended may opt for a military wedding.

===Vow renewal wedding===
A [[wedding vow renewal ceremony|wedding vow renewal]] is a ceremony in which a married couple renews or reaffirms their wedding vows. Typically, this ceremony is held to commemorate a milestone wedding anniversary. It may also be held to recreate the marriage ceremony in the presence of family and friends, especially in the case of an earlier [[Elopement (marriage)|elopement]].

===Same-sex wedding===
[[File:Same-sex-marriage-taiwan.jpg|thumbnail|Taiwanese couple after wedding ceremony.]]
A ''[[Same-sex marriage|same-sex wedding]]'' is a ceremony in which two people of the same sex are married. This event may be legally documented as a marriage or another legally recognized partnership such as a [[civil union]]. Where such partnerships are not legally recognized, the wedding may be a religious or symbolic ceremony designed to provide an opportunity to make the same public declarations and celebration with friends and family that any other type of wedding may afford. These are often referred to as &quot;commitment ceremonies.&quot; Same-sex weddings are not legally recognized in most countries. The first laws enabling same-sex marriage in modern times were enacted during the first decade of the 21st century. {{As of|2016|01|01|df=y}}, nineteen countries of  206 total states ([[Same-sex marriage in Argentina|Argentina]], [[Same-sex marriage in Belgium|Belgium]], [[Same-sex marriage in Brazil|Brazil]], [[Same-sex marriage in Canada|Canada]], [[Same-sex marriage in Denmark|Denmark]],&lt;ref group=&quot;nb&quot; name=&quot;Denmark&quot;&gt;Excluding the Faroe Islands and Greenland.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Same-sex marriage in France|France]], [[Same-sex marriage in Iceland|Iceland]], [[Same-sex marriage in Ireland|Ireland]], [[Same-sex marriage in Luxembourg|Luxembourg]], the [[Same-sex marriage in the Netherlands|Netherlands]],&lt;ref group=&quot;nb&quot; name=&quot;Netherlands&quot;&gt;Excluding Aruba, Curaçao and St Maarten.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Same-sex marriage in New Zealand|New Zealand]],&lt;ref group=&quot;nb&quot; name=&quot;New Zealand&quot;&gt;Excluding Tokelau, Niue and the Cook Islands.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Same-sex marriage in Norway|Norway]], [[Same-sex marriage in Portugal|Portugal]], [[Same-sex marriage in South Africa|South Africa]], [[Same-sex marriage in Spain|Spain]], [[Same-sex marriage in Sweden|Sweden]], the [[Same-sex marriage in the United Kingdom|United Kingdom]],&lt;ref group=&quot;nb&quot; name=&quot;United Kingdom&quot;&gt;Excluding Northern Ireland and territories outside the four [[Countries of the United Kingdom|constituent countries]], such as the [[Crown dependencies]].&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Same-sex marriage in the United States|United States]] and [[Same-sex marriage in Uruguay|Uruguay]]) and certain sub-national jurisdictions (parts of [[Recognition of same-sex unions in Mexico|Mexico]]) allow same-sex couples to marry.  
Polls show rising support for legally recognizing same-sex marriage in the Americas and in parts of Europe.&lt;ref&gt;See

Officiants at same-sex weddings may be religiously ordained. Some religions and branches of religions, including [[Quaker]]s, [[Lutheran]]s, [[Reformed]], [[Unitarianism|Unitarian]]s, [[Ethical movement|Ethical Culture]], [[Reform Judaism|Reform Jews]] and [[Reconstructionist Judaism|Reconstructionist Jew]]s, the [[Metropolitan Community Church]], the [[Independent Catholic Churches|Reformed Catholic Church]], and Buddhist organizations like [[Soka Gakkai]] perform and recognize same-sex marriages, even if the governments of the states where they live may not.

Wedding ceremonies for gay couples are internally very diverse, with some patterned closely after traditional opposite-sex weddings and others created ex nihilo. One ceremony ends with &quot;I now pronounce you married. You may kiss your husband.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://theamm.org/wedding-ceremony-scripts/5056/the-david-mcmahon-and-steven-labarre-ceremony/ |title=Wedding Ceremony Scripts |publisher=Theamm.org |date=2015-10-03 |accessdate=2015-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Shotgun wedding===
A ''[[shotgun wedding]]'' is a wedding in which the groom is reluctant to marry the bride, however, is strongly encouraged to do so to avoid family, social or legal repercussions. In many cases, the bride is pregnant before the wedding and the family of the bride, most commonly the bride's father, insists that the groom marry the bride before the pregnancy becomes obvious.

===Weekend wedding===
A ''weekend wedding'' is a wedding in which couples and their guests celebrate over the course of an entire weekend. Special activities, such as spa treatments and golf tournaments may be scheduled into the wedding itinerary. Lodging usually is at the same facility as the wedding and couples often host a Sunday brunch for the weekend's finale.

===White wedding===
[[File:&quot;...Лучшее, конечно, впереди!&quot; &quot;... The best, of course, ahead!&quot; ) (3527495977).jpg|thumb|||White wedding]]
{{Main|White wedding}}
A ''white wedding'' is a term for a traditional formal or semi-formal Western wedding. This term refers to the color of the wedding dress, which became popular after Queen Victoria wore a pure white gown when she married [[Albert, Prince Consort|Prince Albert]], and many were quick to copy her choice. At the time, the color white symbolized both extravagance and sexual purity to many, and had become the color for use by girls of the royal court.&lt;ref name=&quot;Otnes 2003 p.31&quot;/&gt;

=== Peasant wedding ===
[[File:Boerenbruiloft.png|left|thumb|The groom and bride (with traditional &quot;[[poffer]]&quot;) of the peasant wedding / boerenbruiloft at the Dutch [[carnival in the Netherlands|carnaval]]]]
A peasant wedding is a [[Netherlands|Dutch]] [[carnival in the Netherlands|carnaval]] custom.
Not everywhere in [[Limburg (Netherlands)|Limburg]] and [[North Brabant|Brabant]] is a ''boerenbruiloft'' (peasant's wedding) part of the carnaval. Especially in the northern and central part of Limburg and eastern part of North Brabant is the ''boerenbruiloft'' very often held during the carnaval and is an important part of the carnaval culture.
Each carnaval association has its own tradition concerning choosing the spouse for a wedding. Often the bride and groom are chosen by the council of eleven or by the couple that was married the year before.

It is not necessary that the newlyweds are a couple in real life. It is also not necessary that the bride and groom are single. Both the bride and groom, however, should be in love during the carnaval and they need to transfer their love to all the people who celebrate their wedding along with them. The highlight of the festival of the peasant wedding is the wedding and feast of the ''onecht'' (not-marriage) of the bride and groom. There are many aspects that can be found in a real-life marriage. First the [[engagement]] will be announced just as if it would be an officially marriage. And both the families should learn to know each other very well in organizing the party and the ceremony, like a normal wedding. The two families prepare a piece of entertainment for the wedding. And just like a real wedding, a [[Wedding reception|reception]] and a feast is organized where guests are asked to wear appropriate clothing. The bride and groom will often dress in wedding clothing from before 1940. The bride for example will often wear a [[poffer]], which is a traditional Brabantian headdress.&lt;ref name=&quot;Vastelaovendinlimburg.nl&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.vastelaovendinlimburg.nl/2013/02/01/boerenbruiloft-hoezo-in-het-onecht-verbonden/ |title=Boerenbruiloft: hoezo in het ‘onecht’ verbonden? &amp;#124; Vastelaovend en Carnaval in Limburg |publisher=Vastelaovendinlimburg.nl |date=2013-04-08 |accessdate=2013-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Origin====
The first mention of a &quot;boerenbruiloft&quot; ([[peasant]] wedding) was in 1582, when the [[Saxon]] [[prince-electors|elector]] [[Augustus, Elector of Saxony|August]] in [[Dresden]] wedded a [[peasant]] and his wife during a large ritual ceremony ''d'n onech'' (the not-marriage). It was not a real wedding and the to-be spouse were also not real peasants, but rather the nobility. The real peasants were given the role of [[noblemen]]. It was a reversal ritual, in which the roles were deliberately reversed. This role reversal was intended to avoid the attraction of the [[christian]] [[god]]. Within the noble circles it was believed that it was the eye of the god which at the beginning of the spring focused on them because of their failure in the past year. They thought they could escape this danger by dressing during this wedding celebrations and to behave as peasants, and thus appear to be the people at the bottom of the social ladder. They believed the consequence was that the peasants dressed as nobleman would be harmed by their god instead of the nobles themselves.&lt;ref name=&quot;Vastelaovendinlimburg.nl&quot;/&gt;

[[File:barbeque block party Kansas city.jpg|thumb|A barrel-shaped barbecue on a trailer. Pans on the top shelf hold hamburgers and hot dogs. The lower grill is being used to cook pork ribs and &quot;[[drunken chicken]]&quot;.]]

'''Barbecue''' (also '''barbeque''', '''BBQ''' and '''barby/barbies''') is both a cooking method and an apparatus. The generally accepted differences between barbecuing and [[grilling]] are cooking durations and the types of heat used. Grilling is generally done quickly over moderate-to-high direct heat that produces little smoke, while barbecuing is done slowly over low, [[Indirect grilling|indirect heat]] and the food is flavored by the [[Smoking (cooking)|smoking process]].

The word barbecue when used as a noun can refer to the cooking method, the meat cooked in this way, the cooking apparatus (the &quot;[[barbecue grill]]&quot; or simply &quot;barbecue&quot;), or to an event where this style of food is featured. Used as an adjective, &quot;barbecued&quot; refers to foods cooked by this method. The term is also used as a verb for the act of cooking food in this manner. Barbecuing is usually done out-of-doors by [[smoked meat|smoking the meat]] over wood or charcoal. [[Barbecue restaurant|Restaurant barbecue]] may be cooked in large brick or metal ovens designed for that purpose. There are numerous [[regional variations of barbecue|regional variations]] of barbecuing, and it is practiced around many areas of the world.

==Etymology==
[[File:Baby back ribs - hickory smoked.jpg|thumb|Barbecued hickory-smoked, baby-back pork ribs]]

Some [[Etymology|etymologists]] believe the word ''barbecue'' derives from ''barabicu'' found in the language of the [[Taíno]] people of the [[Caribbean]] and the [[Timucua]] of [[Florida]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hale|first1=C.

Co.|location=McComb, MS|isbn=0936171022}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=December 2015}} it has entered some European languages in the form of ''[[barbacoa]]''. The ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' (OED) traces the word to Haiti and translates it as a &quot;framework of sticks set upon posts&quot;.&lt;ref name=OED&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://old.cbbqa.org/history/secondary/OxfordEngDictionary.html |title=Oxford Dictionary |publisher=Old.cbbqa.org |date= |accessdate=2015-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gonzalo Fernández De Oviedo y Valdés, a Spanish explorer, was the first to use the word &quot;barbecoa&quot; in print in Spain in 1526 in the ''Diccionario de la Lengua Española (2nd Edition) of the Real Academia Española.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Goldwyn |first=Meathead |url=http://amazingribs.com/BBQ_articles/barbecue_history.html |title=The history of barbecue |publisher=Amazingribs.com |date= |accessdate=2015-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; After Columbus landed in the Americas in 1492, the Spaniards apparently found native Haitians roasting meat over a grill consisting of a wooden framework resting on sticks above a fire. The flames and smoke rose and enveloped the meat, giving it a certain flavor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Peters|first1=Philip Dickenson|title=Caribbean Wow 2.0|date=2003|publisher=House of Zagada|location=Coral Gables, Fla.|isbn=9781929970049|page=27|edition=1st|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tXbo9H6t1TcC&amp;pg=PA69&amp;lpg=PA69&amp;dq=barbecue+Haiti+barbacoa+Columbus&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=qR6RUhoxAs&amp;sig=Y0jbdEgKFSGKkcohj-uQhZJgzr8&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=9ntfVdHjJciCyQT-6YHAAQ&amp;ved=0CCAQ6AEwAjgU#v=onepage&amp;q=barbecue%20Haiti%20barbacoa%20Columbus&amp;f=false|accessdate=12 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same framework was also used as protection from nocturnal animal attacks.{{cn|date=December 2015}}

Traditional ''barbacoa'' involves digging a hole in the ground and placing some meat—usually a whole [[lamb and mutton|lamb]]—above pot so the juices can be used to make a broth. It is then covered with [[Agave americana|maguey]] leaves and coal, and set alight. The cooking process takes a few hours. [[Olaudah Equiano]], an African abolitionist, described this method of roasting alligators among the ''Mosquito People'' ([[Miskito people]]) on his journeys to [[Cabo Gracias a Dios]] in his narrative ''[[The Interesting Narrative of the Life of Olaudah Equiano]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Equino|first1=Olaudah|title=The Interesting Narrative of the Life of Olaudah Equiano|date=2012|publisher=Start Publishing LLC|location=Lanham|isbn=1625584717|page=316|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=hkjCHNpp0woC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=12 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Linguists have suggested the word barbacoa migrated from the Caribbean and into other languages and cultures; it moved from Caribbean dialects into [[Spanish language|Spanish]], then [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], [[French language|French]], and [[English language|English]]. According to the OED, the first recorded use of the word in English was a verb in 1661, in [[Edmund Hickeringill]]'s ''Jamaica Viewed'': &quot;Some are slain, And their flesh forthwith Barbacu'd and eat&quot;.&lt;ref name=OED /&gt; The word ''barbecue'' was published in English in 1672 as a verb from the writings of [[John Lederer]], following his travels in the North American southeast in 1669-70.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lederer|first1=John|title=The Discoveries of John Lederer|date=1672|page=28|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VAsOAAAAIAAJ&amp;q=barbecue&amp;dq=barbecue&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=KwkATvyQEsydgQeRt4zNDQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5&amp;ved=0CD4Q6AEwBDiCAQ|accessdate=12 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first known use of the word as a noun was in 1697 by the British buccaneer [[William Dampier]].

In general [[British English|British]] usage, ''barbecuing'' refers to a fast cooking process done directly over high heat, while ''grilling'' refers to cooking under a source of direct, moderate-to-high heat—known in the United States as ''broiling''. In [[Comparison of American and British English|American English]] usage, ''grilling'' refers to a fast process over high heat while ''barbecuing'' refers to a slow process using indirect heat or hot smoke, similar to some forms of [[roasting]]. In a typical U.S. home grill, food is cooked on a grate directly over hot charcoal, while in a U.S. barbecue the coals are dispersed to the sides or at a significant distance from the grate. Its South American versions are the southern Brazilian [[churrasco]] and the Argentine [[asado]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Matthew Bell |url=http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/food-and-drink/reviews/gaucho-grill-how-to-cook-the-argentinian-way-8717832.html |title=Gaucho grill: How to cook the Argentinian way &amp;#124; Reviews &amp;#124; Lifestyle |publisher=The Independent |date=2013-07-18 |accessdate=2015-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Barbecue in the United States}}

In the southern United States, barbecues initially involved the cooking of pork. During the 19th century, pigs were a low-maintenance food source that could be released to forage in woodlands. When food or meat supplies were low, these semi-wild pigs could then be caught and eaten.{{cn|date=December 2015}}

According to estimates, prior to the [[American Civil War]], Southerners ate around {{Convert|5|lbs|kg|spell=in}} of pork for every {{Convert|1|lbs|kg|spell=in}} of beef they consumed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Taylor|first1=Joe Gray|title=Eating, Drinking, and Visiting in the South: An Informal History|date=1982|publisher=Louisiana State Univ.

In [[Cajun]] culture, these feats are called ''boucheries'' or &quot;[[pig pickin']]s&quot;. The traditional Southern barbecue grew out of these gatherings.{{cn|date=December 2015}}

Each Southern locale has its [[regional variations of barbecue|own variety]] of barbecue, particularly sauces. [[North Carolina]] sauces vary by region; eastern North Carolina uses a vinegar-based sauce, the center of the state uses [[Lexington Barbecue Festival|Lexington-style barbecue]], with a combination of [[ketchup]] and vinegar as their base, and western North Carolina uses a heavier ketchup base. Lexington calls itself &quot;The Barbecue Capital of the World&quot;; it has more than one BBQ restaurant per 1,000 residents.&lt;ref&gt;[http://okramagazine.org/2013/05/24/the-bbq-chronicles-lexington-style-bbq-or-extra-bark-please/ ] {{wayback|url=http://okramagazine.org/2013/05/24/the-bbq-chronicles-lexington-style-bbq-or-extra-bark-please/ |date=20150929194750 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[South Carolina]] is the only state that traditionally includes all four recognized barbecue sauces, including mustard-based, vinegar-based, and light and heavy tomato-based sauces. [[Memphis-style barbecue|Memphis barbecue]] is best known for tomato- and vinegar-based sauces. in some Memphis establishments and in Kentucky, meat is rubbed with dry seasoning ([[spice rub|dry rubs]]) and [[smoking (cooking)|smoked]] over [[hickory]] wood without sauce. The finished barbecue is then served with barbecue sauce on the side.{{cn|date=December 2015}}

The barbecue of [[Alabama]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], and [[Tennessee]] is almost always pork served with a sweet tomato-based sauce. Several regional variations exist. Alabama is known for its distinctive white sauce—a mayonnaise- and vinegar-based sauce originating in northern Alabama, used predominantly on chicken and pork. A popular item in North Carolina and Memphis is the [[pulled pork]] sandwich served on a bun and often topped with [[coleslaw]]. Pulled pork is prepared by shredding the pork after it has been barbecued.{{cn|date=December 2015}}

[[Kansas City-style barbecue]] is characterized by its use of different types of meat, including pulled pork, pork ribs, burnt ends, smoked sausage, beef brisket, beef ribs, smoked/grilled chicken, smoked turkey, and sometimes fish—a variety attributable to Kansas City's history as a center for meat packing. Hickory is the primary wood used for smoking in KC, while the sauces are typically tomato based with sweet, spicy, and tangy flavors. [[Burnt ends]], pieces of meat cut from the ends of a smoked beef brisket, are popular in many Kansas City-area barbecue restaurants.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}}

Pit-beef prevails in [[Maryland]] and is often enjoyed at large outdoor &quot;bull roasts&quot;, which are commonly fundraising events for clubs and associations. Maryland-style pit-beef is not the product of barbecue cookery in the strictest sense; the meat is not smoked but grilled over a high heat. The meat is typically served rare with a strong [[horseradish]] sauce as the preferred condiment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Raichlen |first=Steven |url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?sec=travel&amp;res=9501EFD81230F93BA15755C0A9669C8B63 |title=How to Say Barbecue in Baltimore - NYTimes.com |location=Baltimore (Md) |publisher=New York Times |date=2000-06-28 |accessdate=2015-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The state of [[Kentucky]], particularly Western Kentucky, is unusual in its barbecue cooking; the preferred meat is [[mutton]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newyorker.com/archive/1977/02/07/1977_02_07_070_TNY_CARDS_000321582 |title=Stalking the Barbecued Mutton |publisher=The New Yorker |date=1977-02-07 |accessdate=2015-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; This kind of mutton barbecue is often used in communal events in Kentucky, such as political rallies, [[county fairs]], and church fund-raising events.{{cn|date=December 2015}}

In the midwest, Chicago-style is popular; this involves seasoning the meat with a dry rub, searing it over a hot grill, and cooking it slowly in an oven. The meat, typically ribs, is then finished with a sweet and tangy sauce.{{cn|date=December 2015}}

==Events and gatherings==
[[File:Propane smoker.jpg|thumb|Diagram of a propane smoker used for barbecuing]]

The word ''barbecue'' is also used to refer to a social gathering where food is served, usually outdoors in the evening or late afternoon.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}} In the southern United States, outdoor gatherings are not typically called &quot;barbecues&quot; unless barbecue itself  is served, typically, they use the term &quot;cookouts&quot;.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}} The device used for cooking at a barbecue is commonly referred to as a &quot;barbecue&quot;, &quot;barbecue grill&quot;, or &quot;grill&quot;. In North Carolina, however, &quot;barbecue&quot; is a noun primarily referring to the food; natives of the state never use the word to describe the act of cooking or the device on which the meat is cooked.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ncpedia.org/culture/food/barbecue |title=Barbecue |publisher=NCpedia |date= |accessdate=2015-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Barbecue competitions are held in virtually every state in the United States between around April and September. These events feature competitions between teams of cooks and are divided into separate competitions for the best pork, beef, and poultry barbecue, and for the best barbecue sauces.{{cn|date=December 2015}}

==Techniques==
{{Unreferenced-section|date=December 2015}}
Barbecuing encompasses four or five distinct types of cooking techniques. The original technique is cooking using smoke at low temperatures—usually around 240–280&amp;nbsp;°F or 115–145&amp;nbsp;°C—and significantly longer cooking times (several hours), known as ''smoking''. Another technique, known as ''baking'', used a masonry oven or baking oven that uses convection to cook meats and starches with moderate temperatures for an average cooking time of about an hour. ''Braising'' combines direct, dry heat charbroiling on a ribbed surface with a broth-filled pot for moist heat. Using this technique, cooking occurs at various speeds, starting fast, slowing down, then speeding up again, lasting for a few hours.{{cn|date=December 2015}}

Grilling is done over direct, dry heat, usually over a hot fire over {{convert|500|°F|°C|abbr=on}}) for a few minutes. Grilling may be done over wood, charcoal, gas, or electricity. The time difference between barbecuing and grilling is because of the temperature difference; at low temperatures used for barbecuing, meat takes several hours  to reach the desired [[Temperature (meat)|internal temperature]].{{cn|date=December 2015}}

===Smoking===
[[File:BBQ Food.jpg|thumb|Chicken, pork and bacon wrapped corn cooked in a barbecue smoker]]
{{Main|Smoking (cooking)}}

Smoking is the process of flavoring, cooking, or preserving food by exposing it to smoke from burning or smoldering material, most often wood. Meat and fish are the most common smoked foods, though cheeses, vegetables, nuts, and ingredients used to make beverages such as [[beer]] or [[smoked beer]] are also smoked.&lt;ref&gt;McGee p. 767: &quot;Malt whiskies from Scotland's west coast have a unique, smoky flavor that comes from the use of peat fire for drying the malt.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;{{Full citation needed|date=December 2015}}

===Roasting===
{{See also|Pit barbecue}}

The [[masonry oven]] is similar to a smoke pit; it allows for an open flame but cooks more quickly and uses [[convection]] to cook. Barbecue-baking can also be done in traditional stove-ovens. It can be used to cook meats, breads and other starches, [[casserole]]s, and desserts. It uses direct and indirect heat to surround the food with hot air to cook, and can be basted in much the same manner as grilled foods.{{cn|date=December 2015}}

===Braising===
It is possible to braise meats and vegetables in a pot on top of a grill. A gas or electric charbroil grill are the best choices for ''barbecue-braising'', combining dry heat charbroil-grilling directly on a ribbed surface and braising in a broth-filled pot for moist heat. The pot is placed on top of the grill, covered, and allowed to simmer for a few hours. There are two advantages to barbecue-braising; it allows browning of the meat directly on the grill before the braising. It also allows for glazing of meat with sauce and finishing it directly over the fire after the braising. This effectively cooks the meat three times, which results in a soft, textured product that falls off the bone. The time needed for braising varies depending on whether a [[slow cooker]] or [[pressure cooker]] is used; it is generally slower than regular grilling or baking, but quicker than pit-smoking.{{cn|date=December 2015}}

==Other uses==
The term ''barbecue'' is also used to designate a flavor added to foodstuffs, the most prominent of which are [[potato chips]].{{cn|date=December 2015}}

[[Image:Lingerie.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|Assorted lingerie styles]]

'''Lingerie''' are women's [[undergarment]]s, and may imply their being fashionable and alluring.

Lingerie undergarments use flexible, stretchy, sheer, or decorative materials like [[Lycra]], [[nylon]] (nylon tricot), [[polyester]], [[satin]], [[lace]], [[silk]] and [[sheer fabric]]. Certain cotton or synthetic undergarments are also lingerie.

== Etymology ==
[[Image:Knickers1.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.7|Women's [[panties]]]]
The word ''lingerie'' derives from the French word ''[[wikt:linge#French|linge]]'', meaning '[[linen]]'. So ''faire le linge'', comes to mean &quot;do the laundry&quot;. In [[French language|French]] the word ''lingerie'' applies to all undergarments for either sex.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}} In English it means women's underwear or nightclothes.&lt;ref&gt;''The concise Oxford dictionary'', 9th ed, p792.&lt;/ref&gt; Lingerie as a word was first used to refer underwear and bras in 1922.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Hooray for the bra: A perky peek at the history of the brassiere|last = Berry|first = Cheree|publisher = Tabori &amp; Chang|year = 2006|isbn = 1584795271|location = New York|pages = 4–10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Informal usage suggests visually appealing or even [[Eroticism|erotic]] clothing. Although most lingerie is designed to be worn by women, some manufactures now design lingerie for men.

== Origins ==

The concept of lingerie as a visually appealing undergarment was developed during the late nineteenth century.  [[Lucy, Lady Duff-Gordon|Lady Duff-Gordon]] of Lucile was a pioneer in developing lingerie that freed women from more restrictive [[corset]]s. Through the first half of the 20th century, women wore underwear for three primary reasons: to alter their outward shape (first with [[corset]]s and later with [[girdle]]s or [[Brassiere|bra]]s), for [[hygiene|hygienic]] reasons, or for [[modesty]]. Before the invention of [[crinoline]], women's underwear  was often very large and bulky. During the late 19th century, corsets became smaller, less bulky and constricting, and were gradually supplanted by the [[brassiere]], first patented in the 20th century by [[Caresse Crosby|Mary Phelps Jacob]]. When the [[World War I|First World War]] broke out, women found themselves filling in men's work roles, creating a demand for more practical undergarments. Manufacturers began to use lighter and more breathable fabrics.

As the 20th century progressed, underwear became smaller and more form fitting. In the 1960s, lingerie manufacturers such as [[Frederick's of Hollywood]] begin to glamorize lingerie. The lingerie industry expanded in the 21st century with designs that doubled as outerwear. The French refer to this as 'dessous-dessus' which basically means innerwear as outerwear.

== Market structure ==
[[File:Kelly Gale 2014.jpg|thumb|upright=0.6|[[Victoria's Secret fashion show]], 2014. [[Victoria's Secret]] is [[United States|United State]]’s largest lingerie retailer.&lt;ref&gt;[http://fortune.com/2014/12/02/7-surprising-facts-about-the-victorias-secret-business/ 7 surprising facts about the victorias secret business. &quot;Fortune.com&quot;, 2014]&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The lingerie market at the turn of the 21st century was driven by the advent of modern technologies and [[fabric]]s that help in designing innovative products such as laser-cut seamless bras and moulded T-shirt bras. Designers are putting greater emphasis on rich-looking fabrics, [[lace]]s, embroideries and brighter, more daring colors.

The global lingerie market in 2003 was estimated at $29 billion, while in 2005, [[Brassiere|Bra]]s accounted for 56 per cent of the lingerie market and [[briefs]] represented 29 per cent. [[United States]]’s largest lingerie retailer, [[Victoria's Secret]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://fortune.com/2014/12/02/7-surprising-facts-about-the-victorias-secret-business/ 7 surprising facts about the victorias secret business. &quot;Fortune.com&quot;, 2014]&lt;/ref&gt; operates almost exclusively in North America, but the European market is fragmented, with [[Triumph International]] and [[DBApparel|DB Apparel]] predominant.

Also predominant are French lingerie houses, including [[Chantelle (underwear)|Chantelle]], Aubade and Simone Pérèle, each with a long history and a commitment to innovation and French style.

Since the mid-1990s, women have had more choice in bra sizes; the focus has changed from choosing bras in an average size to wearing bras that actually fit perfectly.  In the UK, for instance, the media is fuelling an awareness campaign about the need for each woman to have a proper bra fitting before every purchase.

== Typology ==

'''Clothing''' (also called '''clothes''') is fiber and textile material worn on the body. The wearing of clothing is mostly restricted to [[human being]]s and is a feature of nearly all human [[societies]]. The amount and type of clothing worn depends on physical, social and geographic considerations. Some clothing types can be gender specific.

Physically, clothing serves many purposes: it can serve as protection from the [[weather|elements]], and can enhance safety during hazardous activities such as [[hiking]] and cooking. It protects the wearer from rough surfaces, rash-causing plants, [[insect]] bites, splinters, [[Thorns, spines, and prickles|thorns and prickles]] by providing a barrier between the skin and the environment. Clothes can insulate against cold or hot conditions. Further, they can provide a [[hygienic]] barrier, keeping infectious and toxic materials away from the body. Clothing also provides protection from harmful [[Ultraviolet|UV radiation]].

==Origin of clothing==
{{see also|Evolution of hair|History of clothing and textiles}}
There is no easy way to determine when clothing was first developed, but some information has been inferred by studying lice. The [[body louse]] specifically lives in clothing, and diverge from [[head lice]] about 107,000 years ago, suggesting that clothing existed at that time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|author=Ralf Kittler, Manfred Kayser &amp; Mark Stoneking |journal=[[Current Biology]] |volume=13 |pages=1414–1417 |year=2003 |title=Molecular evolution of ''Pediculus humanus'' and the origin of clothing |url=http://www.eva.mpg.de/genetics/pdf/Kittler.CurBiol.2003.pdf |format=[[Portable Document Format|PDF]] |doi=10.1016/S0960-9822(03)00507-4 |pmid=12932325|issue=16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Stoneking&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.current-biology.com/content/article/fulltext?uid=PIIS0960982204009856|last= Stoneking|first= Mark|title= Erratum: Molecular evolution of ''Pediculus humanus'' and the origin of clothing |accessdate=March 24, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://mbe.oxfordjournals.org/content/28/1/29.full &quot;...Lice Indicates Early Clothing Use ...&quot;], Mol Biol Evol (2011) 28 (1): 29-32.&lt;/ref&gt; Another theory is that [[modern human]]s are the only survivors of several species of [[primates]] who may have worn clothes&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and that clothing may have been used as long ago as [[Timeline of human evolution#Homo|650 thousand years ago]].  Other louse-based estimates put the introduction of clothing at around 42,000–72,000 [[Before Present|BP]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.redorbit.com/news/science/13258/naked_ape_humans_lost_body_hair_long_before_finding_clothes/|title=Naked ape: Humans lost body hair long before finding clothes|accessdate=2012-03-13|date=2003-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Functions==
[[Image:Well-clothed baby.jpg|thumb|A [[Infant|baby]] wearing many items of [[winter]] clothing: [[headband]], [[cap]], fur-lined [[Coat (clothing)|coat]], [[shawl]] and [[sweater]]]]

The most obvious function of clothing is to improve the comfort of the wearer, by protecting the wearer from the elements.  In hot climates, clothing provides protection from [[sunburn]] or [[wind]] damage, while in cold climates its thermal insulation properties are generally more important. Shelter usually reduces the functional need for clothing. For example, [[Coat (clothing)|coat]]s, [[hat]]s, [[glove]]s, and other superficial layers are normally removed when entering a warm home, particularly if one is residing or sleeping there. Similarly, clothing has seasonal and regional aspects, so that thinner materials and fewer layers of clothing are generally worn in warmer seasons and regions than in colder ones.

Clothing performs a range of social and [[culture|cultural]] functions, such as individual, occupational and sexual differentiation, and social status.&lt;ref name=&quot;Flugel1930&quot;&gt;{{citation |date=1976. First published 1930 |author=Flugel, John Carl |title=The Psychology of Clothes |series=International Psycho-analytical Library |volume=No.18 |publisher=New York: AMS Press. First published by Hogarth Press, London | isbn = 0-404-14721-6 }} Alternative ISBN 978-0-404-14721-1 (This work is one of the earliest attempts at an overview of the psycho-social and practical functions of clothing)&lt;/ref&gt; In many societies, norms about clothing reflect standards of [[modesty]], [[religion]], [[gender]], and [[social status]]. Clothing may also function as a form of adornment and an expression of personal taste or style.

Clothing can and has in history been made from a very wide variety of materials. [[Clothing material|Materials]] have ranged from leather and furs, to woven materials, to elaborate and exotic natural and synthetic fabrics. Not all body coverings are regarded as clothing. Articles carried rather than worn (such as [[Handbag|purses]]), worn on a single part of the body and easily removed ([[scarves]]), worn purely for adornment ([[jewelry]]), or those that serve a function other than protection ([[eyeglasses]]), are normally considered [[fashion accessory|accessories]] rather than clothing, as are [[footwear]] and [[hat]]s.

Clothing protects against many things that might injure the uncovered human body. Clothes protect people from the elements, including rain, snow, wind, and other weather, as well as from the sun. However, clothing that is too sheer, thin, small, tight, etc., offers less protection. Clothes also reduce risk during activities such as work or sport. Some clothing protects from specific [[environment (biophysical)|environment]]al hazards, such as [[insect]]s, noxious chemicals, weather, [[weapons]], and contact with abrasive substances. Conversely, clothing may protect the environment from the clothing ''wearer'', as with doctors wearing [[scrubs (clothing)|medical scrubs]].

Humans have shown extreme inventiveness in devising clothing solutions to environmental hazards. Examples include: [[space suits]], [[air conditioned clothing]], [[armor]], [[diving suits]], [[swimsuits]], [[Beekeeping#Protective clothing|bee-keeper gear]], [[motorcycle leathers]], [[high-visibility clothing]], and other pieces of [[protective clothing]]. Meanwhile, the distinction between clothing and protective equipment is not always clear-cut—since clothes designed to be fashionable often have protective value and clothes designed for function often consider fashion in their design. Wearing clothes also has social implications. They cover parts of the body that social norms require to be covered, act as a form of adornment, and serve other social purposes.

==Scholarship==
Although dissertations on clothing and its function appear from the 19th century as colonising countries dealt with new environments,&lt;ref name=&quot;Jeffreys1858&quot;&gt;e.g. {{citation |year=1858 |author=Jeffreys, Julius |title=The British Army in India: Its Preservation by an appropriate Clothing, Housing, Locating, Recreative Employment, and Hopeful Encouragement of the Troops |place=London |publisher=Longman, Brown, Green, Longmans &amp; Roberts |url=http://www.archive.org/stream/britisharmyinin01jeffgoog#page/n7/mode/1up |accessdate=8 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; concerted scientific research into psycho-social, physiological and other functions of clothing (e.g. protective, cartage) occurred in the first half of the 20th century, with publications such as [[J. C. Flügel]]'s ''Psychology of Clothes'' in 1930,&lt;ref name=&quot;Flugel1930&quot; /&gt; and Newburgh's seminal ''Physiology of Heat Regulation and The Science of Clothing'' in 1949.&lt;ref name=&quot;Newburgh1968&quot;&gt;{{citation |date=1968. Reprint of 1949 edition |editor=Newburgh, Louis Harry |title=Physiology of Heat Regulation and The Science of Clothing |place=New York &amp; London |publisher=Hafner Publishing}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1968, the field of environmental physiology had advanced and expanded significantly, but the science of clothing in relation to environmental physiology had changed little.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hertig1969&quot;&gt;{{citation |date=February 1969 |author=Hertig, Bruce A |title=Book review: Physiology of Heat Regulation and the Science of Clothing |journal=[[Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine]] |volume=11 |issue=2 |page=100 |url=http://journals.lww.com/joem/Citation/1969/02000/Physiology_of_Heat_Regulation_and_the_Science_of.12.aspx |accessdate=8 September 2010 |doi=10.1097/00043764-196902000-00012}} (reviewer's name appears next to Newburgh, but was not the co-author. See also reviewer's name at bottom of page).&lt;/ref&gt; While considerable research has since occurred and the knowledge-base has grown significantly, the main concepts remain unchanged, and indeed Newburgh's book is still cited by contemporary authors, including those attempting to develop thermoregulatory models of clothing development.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gilligan2010&quot;&gt;{{citation |date=January 2010 |author=Gilligan, Ian |title=The Prehistoric Development of Clothing: Archaeological Implications of a Thermal Model |journal=Journal of Archaeological Method and Theory |volume=17 |issue=1 |pages=15–80 |doi=10.1007/s10816-009-9076-x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural aspects==

===Gender differentiation===
[[Image:3rd Duke of Fife in Kilt. Allan Warren.jpg|left|thumb|150px|Former 3rd Duke of Fife wearing a traditional [[Scottish kilt]]. (1984)]]
[[Image:Gül et Rice.jpg|r|thumb|150px|Former [[United States Secretary of State|US Secretary of State]] [[Condoleezza Rice]] and [[Turkish President]] [[Abdullah Gül]] both wearing Western-style [[business suit]]s.]]

In most cultures, [[gender differences|gender differentiation]] of clothing is considered appropriate for men and women. The differences are in styles, colors and fabrics.

In Western societies, [[skirt]]s, [[Dress (garment)|dresses]] and [[high-heeled shoe]]s are usually seen as women's clothing, while [[necktie]]s are usually seen as men's clothing. [[Trousers]] were once seen as exclusively male clothing, but are nowadays worn by both genders. Male clothes are often more practical (that is, they can function well under a wide variety of situations), but a wider range of clothing styles are available for females. Males are typically allowed to [[bare chested|bare their chests]] in a greater variety of public places. It is generally acceptable for a woman to wear traditionally male clothing, while the converse is unusual.

In some cultures, [[sumptuary law]]s regulate what men and women are required to wear. [[Islam]] requires women to wear more modest forms of attire, usually [[hijab]]. What qualifies as &quot;modest&quot; varies in different Muslim societies. However, women are usually required to cover more of their bodies than men are. Articles of clothing Muslim women wear for modesty range from the [[headscarf]] to the [[burqa]].

Men may sometimes choose to wear [[men's skirts]] such as [[togas]] or [[kilt]]s, especially on ceremonial occasions. Such garments were (in previous times) often worn as normal daily clothing by men.

===Social status===
[[File:MyBarong created this Custom tailored Barong Tagalog for my wedding.jpg|thumb| A barong Tagalog made in [[Fiber]].]]
[[Image:Prokudin-Gorskii-19.jpg|thumb|left|[[Alim Khan]]'s bemedaled [[robe]] sends a social message about his wealth, status, and power]]
In some societies, clothing may be used to indicate rank or [[social status|status]]. In ancient [[Ancient Rome|Rome]], for example, only senators could wear garments dyed with [[Tyrian purple]]. In traditional [[Native Hawaiians|Hawaiian]] society, only high-ranking chiefs could wear [[feather cloak]]s and palaoa, or carved [[whale]] teeth. Under the [[Travancore]] Kingdom of [[Kerala]], ([[India]]), lower [[caste]] women had to pay a tax for the right to cover their upper body. In [[China]], before establishment of the [[Republic of China|republic]], only the emperor could wear [[yellow]]. History provides many examples of elaborate [[sumptuary law]]s that regulated what people could wear. In societies without such laws, which includes most modern societies, social status is instead signaled by the purchase of rare or luxury items that are limited by cost to those with wealth or status. In addition, [[peer pressure]] influences clothing choice.

===Religion===

[[File:Takbir of prayer.jpg|thumb|left|[[Muslim]] men traditionally wear white robes and a cap during prayers]]

Religious clothing might be considered a special case of occupational clothing. Sometimes it is worn only during the performance of religious ceremonies. However, it may also be worn everyday as a marker for special religious status.

For example, [[Jain]]s and Muslim men wear unstitched cloth pieces when performing religious ceremonies. The unstitched cloth signifies unified and complete devotion to the task at hand, with no digression.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}} Sikhs wear a turban as it is a part of their religion.

The cleanliness of religious dresses in Eastern religions like Hinduism, Sikhism, Buddhism, Islam and Jainism is of paramount importance, since it indicates purity.

Clothing figures prominently in the [[Bible]] where it appears in numerous contexts, the more prominent ones being: the story of [[Adam and Eve]] who made coverings for themselves out of [[fig leaf|fig leaves]], [[Joseph (son of Jacob)|Joseph]]'s [[Coat of many colors|cloak]], [[Judah (Bible)|Judah]] and [[Tamar (Genesis)|Tamar]], [[Mordecai]] and [[Esther]]. Furthermore, the priests officiating in the Temple had very specific garments, the lack of which made one liable to death.

In Islamic traditions, women are required to wear long, loose, opaque outer dress when stepping out of the home.{{Citation needed|date=January 2013}} This dress code was democratic (for all women regardless of status) and for protection from the scorching sun. The Quran says this about husbands and wives: &quot;...They are clothing/covering (Libaas) for you; and you for them&quot; (chapter 2:187).

Jewish ritual also requires rending of one's upper garment as a sign of mourning. This practice is found in the Bible when Jacob hears of the apparent death of his son Joseph.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.divreinavon.com/pdf/BegedSimlaJBQ.pdf |title= ?|author= |date= |work= |publisher= |accessdate=9 August 2010}}{{Self-published inline|date=June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin and history==
{{Main|History of clothing}}
{{See also|History of Western fashion|Category:History of clothing}}

===First recorded use===
According to archaeologists and anthropologists, the earliest clothing likely consisted of [[fur]], [[leather]], leaves, or grass that were draped, wrapped, or tied around the body. Knowledge of such clothing remains inferential, since clothing materials deteriorate quickly compared to stone, bone, shell and metal artifacts. Archeologists have identified very early [[sewing needle]]s of bone and ivory from about 30,000 BC, found near [[Kostenki]], [[Russia]] in 1988.&lt;ref&gt;Hoffecker, J., Scott, J., ''Excavations In Eastern Europe Reveal Ancient Human Lifestyles'', University of Colorado at Boulder News Archive, March 21, 2002, [http://www.colorado.edu/news/r/b278a670675fd8d2ca0700cdc0e9d808.html colorado.edu]&lt;/ref&gt; Dyed [[flax]] fibers that could have been used in clothing have been found in a prehistoric cave in the [[Georgia (country)|Republic of Georgia]] that date back to 36,000 [[Before Present|BP]].&lt;ref&gt;Balter M. (2009). Clothes Make the (Hu) Man. Science,325(5946):1329.{{DOI|10.1126/science.325_1329a}} PMID 19745126&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kvavadze E, Bar-Yosef O, Belfer-Cohen A, Boaretto E,Jakeli N, Matskevich Z, Meshveliani T. (2009).30,000-Year-Old Wild Flax Fibers. Science, 325(5946):1359. {{DOI|10.1126/science.1175404}} PMID 19745144 [http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/data/325/5946/1359/DC1/1 Supporting Online Material]&lt;/ref&gt;

Scientists are still debating when people started wearing clothes. Ralf Kittler, Manfred Kayser and Mark Stoneking, [[anthropology|anthropologists]] at the [[Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology]], have conducted a genetic analysis of human [[body lice]] that suggests clothing originated quite recently, around 170,000 years ago. Body lice is an indicator of clothes-wearing, since most humans have sparse body hair, and lice thus require human clothing to survive. Their research suggests the invention of clothing may have coincided with the northward migration of modern ''[[Homo sapiens]]'' away from the warm [[climate]] of [[Africa]], thought to have begun between 50,000 and 100,000 years ago. However, a second group of researchers using similar genetic methods estimate that clothing originated around 540,000 years ago (Reed et al. 2004. PLoS Biology 2(11): e340). For now, the date of the origin of clothing remains unresolved.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}}

===Making clothing===
{{See also|Weaving|knitting|basket weaving}}
Some human cultures, such as the various people of the [[Arctic Circle]], traditionally make their clothing entirely of prepared and decorated furs and skins. Other cultures supplemented or replaced leather and skins with cloth: woven, knitted, or twined from various animal and vegetable fibers.

Although modern consumers may take the production of clothing for granted, making fabric by hand is a tedious and labor-intensive process. The [[textile]] industry was the first to be mechanized&amp;nbsp;– with the [[power loom|powered loom]]&amp;nbsp;– during the [[Industrial Revolution]].

Different cultures have evolved various ways of creating clothes out of cloth. One approach simply involves draping the cloth. Many people wore, and still wear, garments consisting of rectangles of cloth wrapped to fit&amp;nbsp;– for example, the [[dhoti]] for men and the [[sari]] for women in the [[Indian subcontinent]], the Scottish [[kilt]] or the [[Java (island)|Javanese]] [[sarong]]. The clothes may simply be tied up, as is the case of the first two garments; or pins or belts hold the garments in place, as in the case of the latter two. The precious cloth remains uncut, and people of various [[Clothing sizes|sizes]] or the same person at different sizes can wear the garment.

Another approach involves cutting and sewing the cloth, but using every bit of the cloth rectangle in constructing the clothing. The tailor may cut triangular pieces from one corner of the cloth, and then add them elsewhere as [[gusset]]s. Traditional European patterns for men's [[shirt]]s and women's [[chemise]]s take this approach.

Modern European [[fashion]] treats cloth much less conservatively, typically cutting in such a way as to leave various odd-shaped cloth remnants. Industrial sewing operations sell these as waste; home sewers may turn them into [[quilt]]s.

In the thousands of years that humans have spent constructing clothing, they have created an astonishing array of styles, many of which have been reconstructed from surviving garments, [[photo]]s, [[painting]]s, [[mosaic]]s, etc., as well as from written descriptions. Costume history serves as a source of inspiration to current [[fashion designer]]s, as well as a topic of [[professional]] interest to costumers constructing for [[Play (theatre)|plays]], [[film]]s, [[television]], and [[historical reenactment]].

==Contemporary clothing==
=== Western dress code ===
{{main|Western dress code}}
The Western dress code has changed over the past 500+ years.  The mechanization of the textile industry made many varieties of cloth widely available at affordable prices.  Styles have changed, and the availability of synthetic fabrics has changed the definition of &quot;stylish&quot;.  In the latter half of the 20th century, [[jeans|blue jeans]] became very popular, and are now worn to events that normally demand formal attire.  [[Activewear]] has also become a large and growing market.

The licensing of designer names was pioneered by designers like [[Pierre Cardin]] in the 1960s and has been a common practice within the fashion industry from about the 1970s.

=== Spread of western styles ===
By the early years of the 21st century, western clothing styles had, to some extent, become international styles. This process began hundreds of years earlier, during the periods of European [[colonialism]]. The process of cultural dissemination has perpetuated over the centuries as Western media corporations have penetrated markets throughout the world, spreading Western culture and styles. [[Fast fashion]] clothing has also become a global phenomenon. These garments are less expensive, mass-produced Western clothing. Donated [[used good|used]] clothing from Western countries are also delivered to people in poor countries by charity organizations.

=== Ethnic and cultural heritage ===
People may wear [http://www.manndola.com ethnic] or [[national costume|national dress]] on special occasions or in certain roles or occupations. For example, most Korean men and women have adopted Western-style dress for daily wear, but still wear traditional [[hanbok]]s on special occasions, like weddings and cultural holidays. Items of Western dress may also appear worn or accessorized in distinctive, non-Western ways. A Tongan man may combine a used [[T-shirt]] with a Tongan wrapped skirt, or [[tupenu]].

===Sport and activity===
{{Main|Activewear}}
[[File:Abigail Keats Autumn winter 2010 2.JPG|thumb|right|[[Fashion show]]s are often the source of the latest style and trends in clothing fashions.]]
Most sports and physical activities are practiced wearing special clothing, for practical, comfort or safety reasons. Common [[sportswear (activewear)|sportswear]] garments include [[shorts]], [[T-shirt]]s, [[tennis shirt]]s, [[leotard]]s, [[tracksuit]]s, and [[athletic shoe|trainers]]. Specialized garments include [[wet suit]]s (for [[human swimming|swimming]], [[diving]] or [[surfing]]), [[salopettes]] (for [[skiing]]) and [[leotards]] (for [[gymnastics]]). Also, [[spandex]] materials are often used as base layers to soak up sweat. Spandex is also preferable for active sports that require form fitting garments, such as volleyball, wrestling, [[track &amp; field]], dance, gymnastics and swimming.

=== Fashion ===
{{Main|Fashion}}
There exists a  diverse range of styles in fashion, varying by geography, exposure to modern media, economic conditions, and ranging from expensive [[haute couture]] to traditional garb, to [[thrift store]] [[grunge]].

=== Future trends ===
{{Main|Fashion forecasting}}
The world of clothing is always changing, as new cultural influences meet technological innovations. Researchers in scientific labs have been developing prototypes for fabrics that can serve functional purposes well beyond their traditional roles, for example, clothes that can automatically adjust their temperature, repel bullets, project images, and generate electricity. Some practical advances already available to consumers are bullet-resistant garments made with [[kevlar]] and stain-resistant fabrics that are coated with chemical mixtures that reduce the absorption of liquids.

==Political issues==

===Working conditions===
{{Expand section|date=June 2008}}

[[Image:Safety garb for women workers. The uniform at the left, complete with the plastic &quot;bra&quot; on the right, will prevent... - NARA - 522882.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Safety garb for women workers in Los Angeles, California, ca. 1943. The uniform at the left, complete with the plastic &quot;bra&quot; on the right, was designed to prevent occupational accidents among female war workers.]]

Though mechanization transformed most aspects of human industry by the mid-20th century, garment workers have continued to labor under challenging conditions that demand repetitive manual labor. Mass-produced clothing is often made in what are considered by some to be [[sweatshops]], typified by long work hours, lack of benefits, and lack of worker representation. While most examples of such conditions are found in developing countries, clothes made in industrialized nations may also be manufactured similarly, often staffed by undocumented immigrants. {{citation needed|date=March 2010}}

Coalitions of [[NGO]]s, designers (Katharine Hamnett, [[American Apparel]], [[Veja Sneakers|Veja]], [[Quiksilver]], eVocal, Edun,...) and campaign groups like the [[Clean Clothes Campaign]] (CCC) and the [[Institute for Global Labour and Human Rights]] as well as [[textile and clothing trade unions]] have sought to improve these conditions as much as possible by sponsoring awareness-raising events, which draw the attention of both the media and the general public to the workers.

[[Outsourcing]] production to low wage countries like [[Bangladesh]], [[China]], [[India]] and [[Sri Lanka]] became possible when the [[Multi Fibre Agreement]] (MFA) was abolished. The MFA, which placed quotas on textiles imports, was deemed a [[protectionist]] measure.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}} [[Globalization]] is often quoted as the single most contributing factor to the poor [[Occupational safety and health|working conditions]] of garment workers. Although many countries recognize treaties like the [[International Labor Organization]], which attempt to set standards for worker safety and rights, many countries have made exceptions to certain parts of the treaties or failed to thoroughly enforce them. India for example has not ratified sections 87 and 92 of the treaty.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}}

Despite the strong reactions that &quot;sweatshops&quot; evoked among critics of globalization, the production of textiles has functioned as a consistent industry for developing nations providing work and wages, whether construed as exploitative or not, to many thousands of people.

===Fur===
{{Main|Fur clothing}}
The use of animal fur in clothing dates to prehistoric times. It is currently associated in developed countries with expensive, designer clothing, although fur is still used by indigenous people in arctic zones and higher elevations for its warmth and protection. Once uncontroversial, it has recently been the focus of campaigns on the grounds that campaigners consider it cruel and unnecessary. [[PETA]], along with other [[animal rights]] and [[animal liberation movement|animal liberation]] groups have called attention to [[fur farming]] and other practices they consider cruel.

==Life cycle==

===Clothing maintenance===
Clothing suffers assault both from within and without. The human body sheds skin cells and body oils, and exudes sweat, urine, and feces. From the outside, sun damage, moisture, abrasion and dirt assault garments. Fleas and lice can hide in seams. Worn clothing, if not cleaned and refurbished, itches, looks scruffy, and loses functionality (as when [[button]]s fall off, seams come undone, fabrics thin or tear, and [[zipper]]s fail).

In some cases, people wear an item of clothing until it falls apart. Cleaning leather presents difficulties, and bark cloth (tapa) cannot be washed without dissolving it. Owners may patch tears and rips, and brush off surface dirt, but old leather and bark clothing always look ''old''.

But most clothing consists of cloth, and most cloth can be [[laundry|laundered]] and mended (patching, [[darning]], but compare [[felt]]).

=== Laundry, ironing, storage ===
Humans have developed many specialized methods for laundering, ranging from early methods of pounding clothes against rocks in running streams, to the latest in electronic [[washing machine]]s and [[dry cleaning]] (dissolving dirt in [[solvents]] other than water). Hot water washing (boiling), chemical cleaning and ironing are all traditional methods of [[Sterilization (microbiology)|sterilizing]] fabrics for [[hygiene]] purposes.

Many kinds of clothing are designed to be [[Ironing|ironed]] before they are worn to remove wrinkles. Most modern formal and semi-formal clothing is in this category (for example, [[dress shirt]]s and [[suit (clothing)|suits]]). Ironed clothes are believed to look clean, fresh, and neat. Much contemporary casual clothing is made of knit materials that do not readily wrinkle, and do not require ironing. Some clothing is [[permanent press]], having been treated with a coating (such as [[polytetrafluoroethylene]]) that suppresses wrinkles and creates a smooth appearance without ironing.

Once clothes have been laundered and possibly ironed, they are usually hung on [[clothes hanger]]s or folded, to keep them fresh until they are worn. Clothes are folded to allow them to be stored compactly, to prevent creasing, to preserve creases or to present them in a more pleasing manner, for instance when they are put on sale in stores.

===Non-iron===
{{main|Permanent press}}
A resin used for making non-wrinkle shirts releases [[formaldehyde]], which could cause contact dermatitis for some people; no disclosure requirements exist, and in 2008 the U.S. [[Government Accountability Office]] tested formaldehyde in clothing and found that generally the highest levels were in non-wrinkle shirts and pants.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/11/your-money/11wrinkle.html When Wrinkle-Free Clothing Also Means Formaldehyde Fumes]. ''New York Times''.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1999, a study of the effect of washing on the formaldehyde levels found that after 6 months after washing, 7 of 27 shirts had levels in excess of 75 ppm, which is a safe limit for direct skin exposure.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sciencelinks.jp/j-east/article/200006/000020000600A0121887.php Changes of Free Formaldehyde Quantity in Non-iron Shirts by Washing and Storage]. ''Journal of Health Science''.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mending===
In past times, mending was an art. A meticulous [[tailor]] or [[seamstress]] could mend rips with thread raveled from [[hem]]s and seam edges so skillfully that the tear was practically invisible. When the raw material&amp;nbsp;– cloth&amp;nbsp;– was worth more than labor, it made sense to expend labor in saving it. Today clothing is considered a consumable item. Mass-manufactured clothing is less expensive than the labor required to repair it. Many people buy a new piece of clothing rather than spend time mending. The thrifty still replace [[zipper]]s and [[button]]s and sew up ripped hems.

===Recycling===
Used, unwearable clothing can be used for [[quilt]]s, [[:wikt:rag|rags]], [[Carpet|rug]]s, [[bandage]]s, and many other household uses. It can also be recycled into [[paper]]. In Western societies, used clothing is often thrown out or donated to charity (such as through a [[clothing bin]]). It is also sold to [[consignment shop]]s, dress agencies, [[flea market]]s, and in [[online auction]]s. Used clothing is also often collected on an industrial scale to be sorted and shipped for re-use in poorer countries.

There are many concerns about the life cycle of synthetics, which come primarily from petrochemicals.{{Weasel-inline|date=September 2009}} Unlike natural fibers, their source is not renewable and they are not biodegradable.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sweatshirtstation.com/articles/the-textile-materials-eco-battle-between-natural-and-synthetic-fabrics/ The Textile Materials Eco Battle Between Natural and Synthetic Fabrics] &quot;Steven E.

__NOTOC__
[[File:Stocking factory2.jpg|right|200px|thumb|Advertisement for a hosiery factory. Demonstrates both handmade construction and factory production with nineteenth-century technology. Published 1886.]]

''Hosiery'', also referred to as '''legwear''', describes garments worn directly on the [[foot|feet]] and [[human leg|leg]]s. The term originated as the collective term for products of which a maker or seller is termed a '''hosier'''; and those products are also known generically as '''hose'''. The term is also used for all types of knitted fabric, and its thickness and weight is defined by [[Units of textile measurement#Denier|denier]] or opacity.  Lower denier measurements of 5 to 15 describe a hose which may be sheer in appearance, whereas styles of 40 and above are dense, with little to no light able to come through on 100 denier items.

The first references to hosiery can be found in works of [[Hesiod]], where Romans are said to have used leather or cloth in forms of strips to cover their lower body parts. Even the [[Egyptians]] are speculated to have used hosiery as socks have been found in certain tombs.

[[Image:RollerDerbyFishnetStockings00142.JPG|right|thumb|200px|[[Roller derby]] athletes shortly after a bout in [[Boise, Idaho]] wearing [[fishnet stockings|fishnet]] and patterned [[pantyhose]]]]

Most hosiery garments are made by [[knitting]] methods. Modern hosiery is usually tight-fitting by virtue of stretchy fabrics and meshes. Older forms include binding to achieve a tight fit. Due to its close fit, most hosiery can be worn as an undergarment, but it is more commonly worn as a combined under/outer garment.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.google.com/search?q=define%3A%20Hosiery Definitions from Google] do not necessarily limit Hosiery to undergarments. For the purposes of this category, it can include under and outer garments, e.g. leggings and legwarmers.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, the hosiery and sock mills market was over $1.2 billion in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;[[Pell Research]] - Industry Report on Hosiery and Sock Mills&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Porfirio Diaz paint.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Uniform of [[Porfirio Díaz]]]]

A '''uniform''' is a type of clothing worn by members of an organization while participating in that [[organization]]'s activity. Modern uniforms are most often worn by [[armed forces]] and [[paramilitary]] organizations such as [[police]], emergency services, [[security guard]]s, in some workplaces and [[school]]s and by inmates in [[prison]]s. In some countries, some other officials also wear uniforms in their duties; such is the case of the [[Public Health Service Commissioned Corps|Commissioned Corps]] of the [[United States Public Health Service]] or the [[France|French]] [[préfet|prefect]]s.  For some public groups, such as police, it is illegal for non members to wear the uniform.  Other uniforms are [[trade dress]]es (such as the brown uniforms of [[United Parcel Service|UPS]]).

==Service and work uniforms==

[[File:KFCWorker.jpg|thumb|Uniform of [[KFC]] worker]]
Workers sometimes wear uniforms or [[corporate]] clothing of one nature or another. Workers required to wear a uniform include [[retail]] workers, [[bank]] and [[post office]] workers, [[public security]] and [[health care]] workers, [[blue collar]] employees, [[personal trainer]]s in health clubs, instructors in [[summer camp]]s, [[lifeguard]]s, [[janitor]]s, [[public transit]] employees, [[towing]] and [[truck]] drivers,  [[airline]] employees and holiday operators, and [[bar (establishment)|bar]], [[restaurant]] and [[hotel]] employees. The use of uniforms by these organizations is often an effort in [[brand]]ing and developing a standard [[corporate image]] but also has important effects on the employees required to wear the uniform.
 
The term ''uniform'' may be misleading because employees are not always fully uniform in appearance and may not always wear attire provided by the organization, while still representing the organization in their attire. Academic work on organizational dress by Rafaeli &amp; Pratt (1993) referred to uniformity (homogeneity) of dress as one dimension, and conspicuousness as a second.&lt;ref&gt;Rafaeli, A. &amp; Pratt, M. J. 1993. Tailored meaning: On the meaning and impact of organizational dress. Academy of Management Review, 18(1): pp. 32-55.&lt;/ref&gt; Employees all wearing black, for example, may appear conspicuous and thus represent the organization even though their attire is uniform only in the color of their appearance, not in its features. Pratt &amp; Rafaeli, (1997) described struggles between employees and management about organizational dress as struggles about deeper meanings and identities that dress represents.&lt;ref&gt;Pratt, M. &amp; Rafaeli, A. 1997. Organizational dress as a symbol of multilayered social identities. Academy of Management Journal, 40(4): pp. 862-898.&lt;/ref&gt; And Pratt &amp; Rafaeli (2001) described dress as one of the larger set of [[symbols and artifacts in organizations]] which coalesce into a communication grammar.&lt;ref&gt;Pratt, M. &amp; Rafaeli, A. 2001. Symbols as a language of organizational relationships. Research in Organizational Behavior, 23: 93-113.&lt;/ref&gt;

Uniforms are required in many schools.  School uniforms vary from a standard issue T-shirt to rigorous requirements for many items of formal wear at private schools. School uniforms are in place in many public schools as well.

Countries with mandatory school uniforms include [[Japanese school uniform|Japan]], [[korean school uniform|South Korea]], [[Thailand]], [[India]], [[Australia]], [[U.A.E]], [[Singapore]], some schools in [[China]], [[New Zealand]] and the [[United Kingdom]], among as many other places.  In some countries, uniform types vary from school to school, but in the United Kingdom, many pupils between 11 and 16 of age wear a formal jacket, [[necktie|tie]] and [[trousers]] for boys and [[blouse]], [[necktie|tie]] and [[trousers]], [[skirt]], or [[culottes]] for girls.  The ties will usually be in a set pattern for the school, and jackets will usually carry a patch on the breast pocket with the school's name, [[coat of arms]], and [[motto]] or [[emblem]].  Jackets are being replaced in many schools by sweatshirts bearing the school [[Name tag|badge]]. Children in many United Kingdom state primary schools will have a uniform jumper and/or polo shirt with the school name and logo.

[[File:Soviet diplomatic uniform 1943.jpg|thumb|Image from the 1943 Soviet regulations concerning the diplomatic uniform]]
From about 1800 to after the Second World War, diplomats from most countries (and often senior civilian officials generally) wore official uniforms at public occasions. Such uniforms are now retained by only a few diplomatic services, and are seldom worn.

==Prison ==

{{Main|Prison uniform}}
A '''prison uniform''' is any uniform worn by individuals incarcerated in a [[prison]], [[jail]] or similar facility of [[Detention (imprisonment)|detention]].

==Rail road workers and wood cutters==
In December 1870, Jacob Davis American immigrant who work as a tailor was asked by a customer to make a pair of strong working pants for her husband who was a woodcutter. To create suitably robust pants for working, he used duck cloth and reinforced the weak points in the seams and pockets with the copper rivets. Such was the success of these pants that word spread throughout the labourers along the railroad. Davis was making these working pants in duck cotton and, as early as 1871, in denim cotton. Before long, he found he could not keep up with demand and this event conducted to the a creation of the JEANS ó BLUE JEANS as we know it today. Realising the potential value in his reinforced jeans concept, in 1872, he approached Levi Strauss, who was still his supplier of fabric, and asked for his financial backing in the filing of a patent application.Strauss agreed, and on May 20. 1873, US Patent No. 139,121 for “Improvements in fastening pocket openings” was issued in the name of Jacob W. Davis and '''Levi Strauss and Company'''. That same year, Davis started sewing a double orange threaded stitched design onto the back pocket of the jeans to distinguish them from those made by his competitors.This trademark feature became Registered U.S. Trade Mark No.1,339,254.

== Sports ==
{{See also|Baseball uniform|Jersey (clothing)#In sports}}
Most, if not all, [[sports]] teams also wear uniforms, made in the team's distinctive colors, often in different variations for &quot;[[Home (sports)|home]]&quot; and &quot;[[Away colours|away]]&quot; games. In the [[Major professional sports leagues in the United States and Canada|major North American sports leagues]], the choice as to which color uniform a team wears depends largely on the sport/competition. Customarily, [[National Football League]] (NFL) and [[National Hockey League]] (NHL) teams wear their color uniforms for home games. By contrast, [[Major League Baseball]] (MLB) and [[National Basketball Association]] (NBA) teams wear their white uniforms for home games. However, these are not strictly enforced rules for any of the four major leagues in North America. Some NFL teams, most notably the [[Dallas Cowboys]], prefer to wear their white jerseys for home games. When [[Joe Gibbs]] was the head coach of the [[Washington Redskins]], first from 1981-1992, and again from 2004-2007, the Redskins exclusively wore white jerseys at home games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uni-watch.com/research-projects/white-at-home-in-the-nfl|title=White at Home in the NFL|work=www.uni-watch.com|accessdate=July 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[United Kingdom]], especially in football, the terms &quot;kit&quot; or &quot;strip&quot; (as in '[[football kit]]') are more common.

'''Military uniform''' is the standardised [[dress]] worn by members of the [[armed forces]] and [[Paramilitary|paramilitaries]] of various nations. Military dress and military styles have gone through great changes over the centuries from colourful and elaborate to extremely [[Military camouflage|utilitarian]]. Military uniforms in the form of standardised and distinctive dress, intended for identification and display, are typically a sign of organised military forces equipped by a central authority.
The utilitarian necessities of [[war]] and economic frugality are now the dominant factors in uniform design. Most military forces, however, have developed several different uniform types.

Military personnel in most armies and some civilian officials may wear some or all of the following:

*[[battledress]]: khakis or other drab colored working dress. Increasingly superseded by camouflage clothing for field wear, outdoor work and even office wear;
*service dress: formerly active-service and ordinary duty wear. Now worn for semi-formal occasions often with abbreviated forms of embellishment (such as using duller buttons or replacing medals with [[ribbon bars]]). Equivalent of the civilian lounge suit. 
*[[dress uniform]]: worn at ceremonies, official receptions, and other special occasions; medals are typically worn.
*[[full dress uniform]]: special parade or ceremonial dress, often of colorful materials and traditional cut. Modern usage generally restricted to limited categories of personnel such as ceremonial guards, military bands or military academy cadets. 
*[[mess dress]], formal evening dress worn in the mess or at other formal occasions after about 6pm. Equivalent of civilian [[black tie]]. Usually worn with miniaturized medals.

The practice of wearing a form of dress uniform off duty (&quot;walking out dress&quot;) has now largely died out as the modern soldier prefers the casual clothing of his civilian peers.

==Police==
[[File:Polisi patroli.jpg|thumb|[[Indonesian National Police]] officers in uniform during foot patrol]]
The [[Police]] in every country has a uniform for identification as a [[law enforcement]] personnel or agent. They are distinguished from the public by the uniform the police wear during police activity. Usually in each country has its own different police uniform. 

Such as the [[Police uniforms of the United States]] is an example of the police uniform.

==Domestic workers==
[[Domestic worker]]s are often required by their managers to wear a uniform.

==Beautician==
The beauticians use uniforms to protect their skin from oil and acid. These chemical resistant and water proof uniforms are completely safe to be used during work.

==Scouting==
[[File:Ideal Scout.png|thumb|upright|The [[R. Tait McKenzie]] sculpture ''Ideal Scout'' depicts a Scout in proper uniform]]
The Scout uniform is a specific characteristic of the [[Scouting]] movement, in the words of [[Robert Baden-Powell, 1st Baron Baden-Powell|Baden-Powell]] at the 1937 World Jamboree, &quot;it covers the differences of country and race and make all feel that they are members one with another of one World Brotherhood&quot;. The original uniform, which has created a familiar image in the public eye, consisted of a khaki button-up [[shirt]], shorts and a broad-brimmed [[campaign hat]]. Baden-Powell himself wore shorts since being dressed like the youth contributed to reducing perceived &quot;distance&quot; between the adult and the young person. Nowadays, uniforms are frequently blue, orange, red, or green, and shorts are replaced by long pants in areas where the culture calls for modesty, and in winter weather. The campaign hats have also been dropped in some Scouting organisations.

==Buttons==

[[File:1979 Italian army button.jpg|thumb|left|A button from an Italian army uniform, 1979]]
Some uniforms have specially-[[manufactured]] buttons, which, in the case of [[antiques]], often outlast the fabric components of the uniform, and become highly [[collectable]] items.&lt;ref name=&quot;Button Country Uniform buttons page&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://buttoncountry.com/uniform.htm|title=Uniform  (Division II)|last=Peach State Button Club|year=2010|work=Button Country|publisher=buttoncountry.com|accessdate=11 March 2010|location=Georgia, USA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hygiene==
In some countries or regions such as the [[UK]], [[Australia]] or [[Hong Kong]], the cost of cleaning one's uniform or work [[clothing]] can be partially deducted or rebated from the personal [[income tax]], if the organization for which the person works does not have a laundry department or an outsourced [[Industrial laundry|commercial laundry]].&lt;ref name=se67240&gt;{{cite web

A '''wedding reception''' is a [[party]] held after the completion of a [[marriage]] ceremony.  It is held as hospitality for those who have attended the [[wedding]], hence the name reception: the couple ''receives'' society, in the form of family and friends, for the first time as a married couple. Hosts provide their choice of food and drink, although a [[wedding cake]] is popular.  Entertaining guests after a wedding ceremony is traditional in most societies, and can last anywhere from half an hour to many hours or even days.

In some cultures, separate wedding celebrations are held for the bride's and groom's families.

Before receptions—a social event that is structured around a receiving line, and usually held in the afternoon, with only light refreshments—became popular, weddings were more typically celebrated with wedding [[brunch|breakfasts]] (for those whose religious traditions encouraged morning weddings) and wedding [[Ball (dance)|balls]] (for those who were married in the evening).  The popularity of receptions, rather than breakfasts, dinners, and balls, during the 20th century led to the name ''reception'' being applied to any social event after a wedding, whether it is brunch, tea, dinner, or a dance.

The choice depended primarily on the family's economic situation, and in some cases, [[mass wedding]]s were favored as a way to share costs.  At the beginning of the 20th century, [[dance hall]]s became common, and were rented by those planning a celebration beyond what their homes could hold.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

There are also many small businesses that specialize in providing places for wedding ceremonies and celebrations.

===Receiving line=== &lt;!-- &quot;Receiving line&quot; redirects here --&gt;
Technically, to be a ''reception'', instead of some other form of entertainment, guests must be greeted with a receiving line.  In a receiving line, newly wedded couple, the hosts, and often their parents and any honour attendants, stand in [[order of precedence]] and greet every guest in turn.  Each guest greets the first (lowest precedence) person in the line and, if necessary, introduces him/herself.  The first person then introduces the guest to the next person in the line, and turns to the next guest.  As each guest properly speaks little more than his/her name (if necessary) and conventional greetings or congratulations to each person in turn, the line progresses steadily without unnecessary delays. Western etiquette requires at least one of the hosts and the newly married couple, as the guests of honor, to welcome and greet the guests, but the other members of the wedding party, parents who are not hosting the party, siblings, etc., are not required to stand in the receiving line. It is increasingly common to feature only the couple, since more modern couples host and pay for their own weddings rather than their parents.

After formally receiving each guest in this fashion, the receiving line is finished and the people who had been duty-bound to stand in it can mingle with guests, eat, and enjoy more extended conversations.

===Grand entrance===
Another option, especially popular on the East and West Coast of the United States, is having a grand entrance instead of a receiving line.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Choosing Between A Grand Entrance And Receiving Line|url=http://www.belvederebanquets.com/choosing-between-a-grand-entrance-and-receiving-line/|publisher=Belvedere|accessdate=6 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The grand entrance might involve presenting some or all of the wedding party, the parents, and/or the bride and groom.

The wedding party is usually introduced by a [[master of ceremonies]], [[disc jockey]], or band leader.  It may be done in the same manner as they walked down the aisle during the wedding ceremony.  This is generally much faster than a receiving line and guests may be seated before the arrival of the wedding party.  In addition, it can be an event in itself and be as entertaining as wished.  Introductions may be accompanied by music and information about each person to introduce them to the guests.  However, unlike a reception line, it does not give the guests an opportunity to speak to any of the people being presented.

===Food===

[[File:Wedding reception Japan01.jpg|thumb|The wedding cake and other decorations at a wedding reception in Japan]]
The food served at a wedding reception is determined by the time of the wedding and local customs.  Food may range from a single non-alcoholic drink with [[wedding cake]] to elaborate, multi-course dinners.  The type of food is chosen entirely at the discretion of the hosts.

Some receptions, especially if the family's culture or religious faith prohibits alcohol or dancing, focus on dessert.  Hosts may also choose to honor regional or local customs, such as by serving a culturally important cake like [[croquembouche]] in France, or featuring thousands of homemade cookies in [[Pittsburgh]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

[[File:MomDadwedding1955 photos.jpg|thumb|left|The bride and groom cut the wedding cake at an American wedding reception in 1955.]]
The wedding cake is often a multi-tiered [[layer cake]] that is elaborately decorated with white frosting.  Some couples have a smaller display cake, which is supplemented by [[sheet cake]].

The [[groom's cake]] is a tradition observed mainly in the southern United States. In the Colonial and Victorian eras, the white-iced bride's cake was considered &quot;too light&quot; for male tastes, and a second cake choice—usually a dark, liquor-soaked fruitcake—was also offered. Today, chocolate is popular, although the groom's cake may be in any flavor and is usually shaped or decorated as something significant to the groom, such as a favorite hobby or sport.

If a full meal is served, the wedding cake is usually served after the meal.  Otherwise, the cake may be served as soon as the family has received all of the guests.

Commonly, the couple ceremonially cut the first piece of the cake, and in a nod to [[confarreatio|an ancient Roman wedding rite]], may feed a bite to one another and perhaps sip a glass of wine or other drink with linked arms.  Then the cake is served to the guests.  Like being asked to pour tea at a formal [[tea party (social gathering)|tea party]], being asked to serve the cake is generally considered an honor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

===Toasts===
{{Main|Toast (honor)}}

In most [[Western culture|Western]] countries, either before or after food is served, toasts are made by the wedding party, wishing the couple well. Commonly, toasts are proposed by the [[bride]]'s father, the [[bridegroom|groom]], the [[best man]], and/or the [[maid of honor]], although there is no absolutely required list of people who must make toasts, or indeed any requirement to offer toasts at all.&lt;ref name=Martin1&gt;{{cite book

A new trend involves the addition of a DVD slideshow or [[photo montage]] video, featuring pictures of the new spouses growing up and meeting. These are created using [[home movies]] and photos taken over the couple's life, edited and set to music. The montage is shown either on a large TV or monitor or with an [[LCD projector]].

===Dances===
[[File:Flemish Wedding 17th century.jpg|thumb|Flemish wedding, 17th century]]

If there is dancing at the celebrations after the wedding, the newly married couple typically open the dancing with their [[first dance]].&lt;ref name=Martin1 /&gt;  When [[waltz]]ing was popular, it was sometimes called a ''bridal waltz'', although other dance styles are more commonly used now.  The style of dancing depends on the nature of the music chosen. [[Foxtrot|Fox trot]], [[two-step (dance move)|two-step]], or [[Rhumba|rumba]] match most four-count pop ballads.  While most contemporary Western couples select a romantic song and a relatively formal dance style, some couples choose to perform humorous choreographed dances.

Traditionally, shortly after the dance begins, guests would promptly join in the dancing, in [[order of precedence]], exactly like at any other [[ball (dance)|ball]].&lt;ref name=Martin1/&gt;  In very recent times, some families have told guests to not start dancing until after watching a sometimes lengthy sequence of &quot;special&quot; dances.&lt;ref name=Martin1/&gt;  For example, after the first dance, the newly married couple might dance with their parents or new in-laws.  However, there is no requirement that any particular people dance at all, much less with any particular person, and no absolutely required order for the bridal couple, their families, or the bridal party to begin dancing in.&lt;ref&gt;^ Martin, Judith (1995). ''Miss Manners on Painfully Proper Weddings'' New York: Crown Publishers. p. 126. ISBN 978-0517701874.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Entertainment===
Wedding receptions are often the time when couples want to ensure their family and guests will be entertained, and a variety of options such as live bands, professional dancers such as ballroom dancers or belly dancers, fire artists and even comedians are brought in to heighten the festivities and make the wedding stand out. In America and in other countries, including lavish entertainment at the wedding reception is a luxury.

===Departure===
A ceremony is often made of the newlyweds' departure.  Rice or birdseed, signifying abundance, may be thrown at the departing couple, with birdseed preferred by facility managers, since it requires less clean up work than rice, and new, mess-free substitutes, such as blowing [[soap bubble]]s or ringing small bells being even more favored by the cleaning staff.&lt;ref name=Martin1 /&gt;

As the newlyweds are the guests of honor, the other guests are expected to remain at the reception until they leave them, and consequently, it is an imposition on the other guests for the newlyweds to stay unreasonably long at the party.&lt;ref name=Martin1 /&gt;  On occasion, the newlyweds will stage an official leave-taking, so that guests feel free to leave, and then quietly return through another door.

===Expense===
The [[median]] cost of a wedding, including both the ceremony and reception, in the United States, as of 2012, was about US $18,000, according to a large survey at an online [[wedding website]].&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|title = The Wedding Industry’s Pricey Little Secret|url = http://www.slate.com/articles/life/weddings/2013/06/average_wedding_cost_published_numbers_on_the_price_of_a_wedding_are_totally.single.html|newspaper = Slate|date = 19 March 2015|access-date = 2015-05-03|issn = 1091-2339|first = Will|last = Oremus}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Regional differences are significant, with residents of Manhattan paying more than six times as much as residents of Alaska.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;  Additionally, the survey probably overestimates the typical cost because of a [[biased sample]] population.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;

===Other traditions===
[[Wedding traditions]] vary between countries, and between regions of the same country. Some traditions include:

[[Image:Mauritanian wedding party.jpg|right|thumb|Dancing guests at a wedding party in [[Mauritania]]]]
[[Image:East Timor hakka wedding.jpg|thumb|right|Ethnic [[Hakka people]] in a wedding in [[East Timor]], 2006.]]
*''The [[money dance]], or &quot;dollar dance&quot;.'' Guests pay a small amount of money to dance with the bride or groom. In some cultures, the money is pinned to a special apron worn by the bride or groom. In others, the money is collected by friends. This is prevalent among Polish and Italian couples, although many other brides and grooms often incorporate it. There is considerable debate about the propriety of a money dance in English-speaking countries, where the practice is frowned upon because making guests pay for dancing or socializing with the bridal couple seems inhospitable, greedy, or distasteful.&lt;ref name=&quot;isbn0-393-06914-1&quot;&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is accepted when the couple and the majority of their guests are of one of the cultures in which it is traditional.
*''Tossing of the bride's [[Flower bouquet|bouquet]] and [[Garter (stockings)|garter]].''&lt;ref name=Martin1/&gt; The bride tosses her bouquet over her shoulder to a group of all the single women present. Whoever catches it is supposed to be the next to get married. Similarly, the groom tosses the bride's garter to the single men, often after removing it from her leg. On occasion, the bride will &quot;rig&quot; the bouquet toss by tossing the bouquet to a woman who is engaged. The groom then arranges for the fiancé of the bouquet-toss winner to receive the bride's garter. Sometimes, the man who catches the garter is supposed to put it on the leg of the woman who catches the bouquet, or the garter is sold in a [[raffle]] instead of being tossed.
*''Clinking glasses.'' Guests will often clink their glasses during dinner to ask the newlyweds to stand up and kiss. Some couples pass out [[wedding favor]] bells for guests to ring instead of clinking glasses.&lt;ref name=Martin1 /&gt;
*''Favors.'' The hosts may provide a small gift for each guest. Favors may include chocolates, candles, picture frames, or other small gifts.  Such favors are not required.&lt;ref name=Martin1/&gt;

==Chinese culture==

===Gifts===

Unless the wedding couple has a wedding registry, it is best not to give gifts or gift certificates. For Chinese weddings, cash or a cheque is always the best gift. In addition to that, some elder relatives might also give gold jewelry. The cash or cheque should be in a [[red envelope]] or red pocket with the givers' names on it, and it is always given when signing in at the restaurant. In choosing the amount of money to give, givers scrupulously avoid [[Numbers in Chinese culture|unlucky numbers, such as 4]] and favor combinations of lucky numbers, such as 8 and 9.  Also, white envelopes are never used to wrap gifts for a wedding or other joyful event, as the color white is associated with death.

===Timing===

There are two times listed on the invitation: 恭候 (gōnghòu/greeting) and 入席 (rùxí/reception). Typically, they are at least two hours apart (some may be four hours). The first one is the time the groom and bride, along with their family, will be ready to receive guests and greet them; the second one is the time the reception/banquet will start. The gap between those hours is referred to as entertainment time. Very often, the restaurant will provide poker and [[mahjong]] (麻將) for gambling; the time can also be used to socialize with other guests and take photos with the bride/groom and their families. Nowadays, for Chinese couples' weddings in the U.S., you are less likely to see mahjong being played before the banquet; it is often replaced by a cocktail party.{{Citation needed|date=July 2015}} However, if the wedding reception takes place in southern China, Hong Kong, Macau, and even parts of Canada (where there is a large Cantonese population), mahjong might still be played before the dinner.

===Sign-in===
[[File:Marriage reception desk in Thailand.JPG|thumb|Gifts of money may be placed in a special box at the sign-in table.]]
Two people will be at the sign-in tables (one from the bride’s family and one from the groom’s) to register guests and receive gifts/red envelopes. Often, they will have two separate guest lists, one from the groom’s side and one from the bride’s. Then the best man and the maid of honor will direct ushers to escort guests to their seat.

===Banquet procedure===

Typically, the banquet will include a speech from the parents, the best man, the maid of honor, and the guest speaker. There will be cake cutting, toasts, a [[tea ceremony]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chcp.org/wed2.html Chinese Wedding Tea Ceremony]. Chcp.org. Retrieved on 2012-07-11.&lt;/ref&gt; some games designed by the DJ, and dancing. The two tables at the center of the room are for the groom’s and bride’s families.

===Food===

A Chinese wedding reception typically has nine or ten courses. Expensive dishes such as [[shark fin soup|shark fin]], abalone, lobster, jumbo shrimp, squab, sea bass, or [[sea cucumber]] are common on a wedding banquet menu.

A whole fish, chicken, or pig means luck and completeness in Chinese wedding culture.

Traditionally, after the fifth dish of the dinner, the groom and bride and their families will approach each table to toast the guests. Very often, the bride will change into a traditional Chinese red wedding dress (鳳褂, or ''[[Cheongsam|qípáo]]'') at that time, if she has been wearing a different style of clothing before.

[[File:William-Adolphe Bouguereau (1825-1905) - The Proposal (1872).jpg|right|thumb|[[William-Adolphe Bouguereau]]'s ''The Proposal'']]

An '''engagement''', '''betrothal''', or '''fiancer''' is a promise to wed, and also the period of time between a [[marriage proposal]] and a [[marriage]]. During this period, a couple is said to be ''betrothed,'' &quot;intended&quot;, ''affianced'', ''engaged to be married,'' or simply ''engaged''.  Future [[bride]]s and [[groom]]s may be called ''the betrothed'', a ''wife-to-be'' or ''husband-to-be'', ''fiancée'' or ''fiancé'', respectively (from the French word [[wikt:fiancer|fiancer]]). The duration of the courtship varies vastly, and is largely dependent on cultural norms or upon the agreement of the parties involved.

Long engagements were once common in formal [[arranged marriage]]s, and it was not uncommon for parents betrothing children to arrange marriages many years before the engaged couple were old enough.

==Origin==
The origins of [[Europe]]an engagement in marriage practice is found in the Jewish law ([[Torah]]), first exemplified by [[Abraham]], and outlined in the last [[Talmud]]ic tractate of the [[Nashim]] (Women) order, where [[marriage]] consists of two separate acts, called ''[[Erusin (Jewish betrothal)|erusin]]'' (or ''kiddushin'', meaning ''sanctification''&lt;!--BUT historic Jewish writers sometimes use ''kiddushin'' to refer to marriage as a whole, so for the sake of avoiding ambiguity don't use it in the article as a synonym for erusin--&gt;&lt;!--On the other hand, in modern Hebrew, erusin means engagement--&gt;), which is the [[betrothal]] ceremony, and ''nissu'in'' or ''[[chupah]]'',{{efn|To be precise, ''nesiuin'' is the process, and ''chuppah'' is the method.}} the actual [[wedding|ceremony for the marriage]]. ''Erusin'' changes the couple's interpersonal status, while ''nissu'in'' brings about the legal consequences of the change of status. (However, in the Talmud and other sources of Jewish law there is also a process, called ''[[kiddush]]in'', corresponding to what today is called engagement. Marrying without such an agreement is considered immoral.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kaplan|first=Rabbi Aryeh|title=Made in Heaven, A Jewish Wedding Guide|year=1983|publisher=Moznaim Publishing|location=New York / Jerusalem}}, Chapter 4, See also footnote 1 and 2. The author uses the specific term ''proposal'', and considers this the first step in a formal engagement.&lt;/ref&gt; To complicate matters, ''erusin'' in modern Hebrew means engagement, not betrothal.)

This was later adopted in Ancient Greece as the ''gamos'' and ''engeysis'' rituals, although unlike in Judaism the contract made in front of witness was only verbal.&lt;ref&gt;Norman Bancroft Hunt, ''Living in Ancient Greece'', Infobase Publishing, 2008, p.44&lt;/ref&gt; The giving of a ring was eventually borrowed from Judaism by Roman marriage law, with the fiancé presenting it after swearing the oath of marriage intent, and presenting of the gifts at the engagement party.&lt;ref&gt;Philippe Ariès, Paul Veyne,eds., ''A History of Private Life: From pagan Rome to Byzantium'', Harvard University Press, 1992, p.467&lt;/ref&gt;

== Betrothal ==
{{Redirect|Betrothed}}
'''Betrothal''' (also called '''espousal''') is a formal state of engagement to be [[marriage|married]].

In [[Jewish wedding]]s during Talmudic times (c.1st century BC – 6th century AD), the two ceremonies of betrothal (''[[Erusin (Jewish betrothal)|erusin]]'') and wedding usually took place up to a year apart; the bride lived with her parents until the actual marriage ceremony (''[[nissuin]]''), which would take place in a room or tent that the groom had set up for her. Since the Middle Ages the two ceremonies have taken place as a combined ceremony performed in public. The ''betrothal'' is now generally part of the [[Jewish wedding]] ceremony, accomplished when the groom gives the bride the ring or another object of at least nominal value.&lt;ref&gt;See Talmud [[Nashim|Kiddushin]], Mishna 1:1 and the main article&lt;/ref&gt; As mentioned above, betrothal in Judaism is separate from engagement; breaking a betrothal requires a formal [[Get (divorce document)|divorce]], and violation of betrothal is considered [[adultery]].

Typical steps of a match were the following:
* Negotiation of a match, usually done by the couple's families with bride and groom having varying levels of input, from no input, to veto power, to a fuller voice in the selection of marriage partner.
** This is not as widely practiced as it was historically, although it is still common in culturally conservative communities in [[Israel]], [[India]], Africa, and Persian Gulf countries, although most of these have a requirement that the bride be at least allowed veto power.
* Negotiation of [[bride price]] or [[dowry]]
** In most cultures evolved from Europe, bride prices or dowries have been reduced to the [[engagement ring]] accompanying the marriage contract, while in other cultures, such as those on the Arabian Peninsula, they are still part of negotiating a marriage contract.
* Blessing by the parents and [[clergy]]
* Exchange of Vows and Signing of Contracts
** Often one of these is omitted
* Celebration

[[File:Lionel Logue 1906.jpg|thumb|left|Engagement photograph of [[Lionel Logue]] and Myrtle Gruenert, 1906.]]
The exact duration of a betrothal varies according to culture and the participants’ needs and wishes. For adults, it may be anywhere from several hours (when the betrothal is incorporated into the wedding day itself) to a period of several years. A year and a day are common in [[neo-pagan]] groups today. In the case of [[child marriage]], betrothal might last from infancy until the age of marriage.

The responsibilities and privileges of betrothal vary.  In most cultures, the betrothed couple is expected to spend much time together, learning about each other.  In some historical cultures (including [[colonial North America]]), the betrothal was essentially a [[trial marriage]], with marriage only being required in cases of conception of a child.  Almost all cultures are loosening restrictions against physical contact between partners, even in cultures that normally had strong prohibitions against it.  The betrothal period was also considered to be a preparatory time, in which the groom built a house, started a business or otherwise proved his readiness to enter adult society.

In [[medieval Europe]], in [[canon law]], a betrothal could be formed by the exchange of [[vow]]s in the future tense (&quot;I ''will'' take you as my wife/husband,&quot; instead of &quot;I take you as my wife/husband&quot;), but sexual intercourse consummated the vows, making a binding marriage rather than a betrothal.  Although these betrothals could be concluded with only the vows spoken by the couple, they had legal implications: [[Richard III of England]] had his older brother's children declared illegitimate on the grounds their father had been betrothed to another woman when he married their mother.

A betrothal is considered to be a 'semi-binding' contract.  Normal reasons for invalidation of a betrothal include:
* Revelation of a prior commitment or marriage
* Evidence of [[infidelity]]
* Failure to conceive (in 'trial marriage' cultures)
* Failure of either party to meet the financial and property stipulations of the betrothal contract

Normally, either party can break a betrothal, though some [[financial penalty]] (such as forfeit of the bride price) usually applies. In some [[common law]] countries, including England and Wales and many US states, it was once possible for the spurned partner (often only the woman) to sue the other for [[breach of promise]] or &quot;heart-balm&quot;. This provided some protection in an age where virginity at marriage was considered important and having a failed engagement could damage one's reputation, but this [[tort]] has become obsolete in most jurisdictions as attitudes to premarital sex have softened and emphasis shifted to allowing people to leave loveless relationships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite-book|title=Introduction to Family Law|author=Nancy R. Gallo|pages=114-116|year=2004|isbn=1401814530|chapter=Left at the Altar|publisher=Cengage Learning}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Anglican Communion===
The Rite of Betrothal in the [[Anglican Communion]] is found within [[The Book of Common Prayer]], first published in 1549.&lt;ref name=&quot;ProfessorBooks2006&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hefling|first1=Charles |last2=Shattuck|first2=Morehouse Cynthia |title=The Oxford Guide to The Book of Common Prayer|accessdate=9 May 2015|date=1 July 2006|publisher=Oxford University Press|language=English |isbn=9780199723898|page=510}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Anglican Communion, as well as the Methodist Church and Presbyterian Church, has questions &amp; responses for family members in its Rite of Betrothal.&lt;ref name=&quot;Prichard2009&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Prichard|first=Robert W.|title=Cohabiting Couples and Cold Feet: A Practical Marriage-Preparation Guide for Clergy|accessdate=9 May 2015|date=1 January 2009|publisher=Church Publishing, Inc.|language=English |isbn=9780898696035|page=107|quote=The Episcopal ''Book of Common Prayer'' of 1979 reworked the betrothal by adding a positive question to the congregation immediately after the couple speaks their words of betrothal. The celebrant asks the congregation, &quot;Will all of you witnessing these promises do all in your power to uphold these two persons in their marriage?&quot; The congregation's response is, &quot;We will.&quot; This inquiry was expanded in ''The United Methodist Hymnal'' (1989) and the Presybterian ''Book of Common Worship'' (1993) into separate questions for family members and for other members in the congregation.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Orthodox Church===
In the [[Eastern Orthodox]] and [[Oriental Orthodox]] Churches, the Rite of Betrothal is traditionally performed in the [[narthex]] (entranceway) of the church, to indicate the couple's first entrance into the married estate. The priest blesses the couple and gives them lit candles to hold. Then, after a [[ektenia|litany]], and a prayer at which everyone bows, he places the bride's ring on the ring finger of the groom's right hand, and the groom's ring on the bride's finger. The rings are then exchanged three times, either by the priest or by the best man, after which the priest says a final prayer. Originally, the betrothal service would take place at the time the engagement was announced. In recent times, however, it tends to be performed immediately before the wedding ceremony itself. The exchange of rings is not a part of the wedding service in the Eastern Churches, but only occurs at the betrothal. Traditionally, the groom's ring is gold and the bride's ring is silver.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

[[File:Les Très Riches Heures du duc de Berry avril.jpg|right|thumb|upright|Les [Très Riches Heures du Duc de Berry] depicting a betrothal]]

===Roman Catholic Church===
Historically betrothal in Roman Catholicism was a formal [[contract]] considered as binding as marriage, and a divorce was necessary to terminate a betrothal.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.askelm.com/doctrine/d870301.htm Askelm.com]&lt;/ref&gt;  Betrothed couples were regarded legally as husband and wife – even before their wedding and physical union.
The concept of an official engagement period in Western European culture may have begun in 1215 at the [[Fourth Lateran Council]], headed by [[Pope Innocent III]], which decreed that &quot;marriages are to be ... announced publicly in the churches by the priests during a suitable and fixed time, so that if legitimate [[Canonical impediment|impediments]] exist, they may be made known.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/basis/lateran4.html Medieval Sourcebook: Twelfth Ecumenical Council: Lateran IV 1215&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.utunumsint.org/lateran%20iv.htm Utunumsint.org]&lt;/ref&gt;   Such a formal church announcement of the intent to marry is known as [[banns]]. In some jurisdictions, reading the banns may be part of one type of legal marriage.

==Engagement rings==
{{Main|Engagement ring}}

Customs for engagement rings vary according to time, place, and culture. An engagement ring has historically been uncommon, and when such a gift was given, it was separate from the wedding ring.

The tradition of giving a ring for marriage engagement originated from [[Judaism]] that was originally a golden nose ring ([[Chayei Sarah (parsha)|Chayei Sarah]] 24:22) given by [[Eliezer of Damascus]] to [[Rebecca]],{{when|date=October 2011}}&lt;ref&gt;Herczeg, Y.I.Z, ''The Torah: with Rashi's commentary'', Vol.1, Mesorah Publications, New York, 2000, p. 253&lt;/ref&gt; with [[Saadiah Gaon]] also citing as a possible source of the practice in the phrase in [[Nehemiah]] 7:46 ''be’nei tabbaot'' (children of the rings).{{citation needed|date=November 2011}} The latter case refers to betrothal (see above) rather than engagement; one of the three ways in which betrothal may be accomplished in Judaism is by the husband giving the bride money or an object of at least nominal value. In fact, it is a long-standing practice within Judaism to contract the betrothal with a ring.

Romantic rings from the time of the [[Roman Empire]] sometimes bore clasped hands symbolizing contract,&lt;ref&gt;Catherine Johns, ''The jewellery of Roman Britain: Celtic and classical traditions'', Routledge, 1996, p. 63–64&lt;/ref&gt; from which the later [[Celt]]ic [[Claddagh ring|Claddagh]] symbol (two hands clasping a heart) may have evolved as a symbol of love and commitment between two people. Romans believed the circle was a bond between the two people who were to be married and signified eternity, but was first practiced on the [[Ring finger|fourth finger/ring finger]] by the [[Roman Empire|Romans]], who believed this finger to be the beginning of the ''[[vena amoris]]'' (&quot;vein of love&quot;), the vein that leads to the heart.&lt;ref name=&quot;PhilippeAries&quot;&gt;Philippe Ariès, Paul Veyne, ''A History of Private Life: From pagan Rome to Byzantium'', Harvard University Press, 1992, p.467&lt;/ref&gt; In cultures with European origin, and many other countries, an [[engagement ring]] is worn following the practice of the Romans who &quot;...wore the ring either on the right middle finger or the left ring [4th] finger, from which, according to ancient Egyptian physicians, a nerve led directly to the heart.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;PhilippeAries&quot; /&gt; The custom in [[Continental Europe]] and other countries is to wear it on the right hand. One historical exception arose in monarchical regimes, in which a nobleman entering into [[morganatic marriage]], a marriage in which the person, usually the woman, of lower rank stayed at the same rank instead of rising ranks, would present their left hand to receive the ring, hence the alternative term 'marriage with the left hand' (Ger. ''Ehe zur linken Hand''), the offspring of such marriages considered to be disinherited from birth.&lt;ref&gt;Marie Maclean, ''The name of the mother: writing illegitimacy'', Routledge, 1994, p. 191&lt;/ref&gt;

The modern Western form of the practice of giving or exchanging [[engagement ring]]s is traditionally thought to have begun in 1477 when [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor]], gave [[Mary of Burgundy]] a [[diamond]] ring as an engagement present.&lt;ref&gt;Michael R Collings, ''Gemlore: An Introduction to Precious and Semi-Precious Stones'', Wildside Press LLC, 2009, p. 50&lt;/ref&gt;

In other countries like [[Argentina]], men and women each wear a ring similar to wedding bands. They are made of silver (&quot;alianza de plata&quot;) when manifesting an informal &quot;boyfriend-girlfriend&quot; relationship, though this first step might not always happen; howbeit depending on finances, this may be the only ring given at all. The gold band (&quot;anillo de compromiso&quot; or &quot;alianza de oro&quot;) is given to the bride when the commitment is formal and the [optional] diamond ring (&quot;cintillo&quot;) is reserved for the wedding ceremony when the groom gives it to the bride. The gold band that the groom wore during the engagement – or a new one, as some men choose not to wear them during engagement – is then given to the groom by the bride; and the bride receives both the original gold band and the new diamond at the ceremony. The bride's diamond ring is worn on top of the engagement band at the wedding and thereafter, especially at formal occasions or parties; otherwise the engagement band suffices for daily wear for both parties. At the wedding, the rings are swapped from the right to the left hand. In [[Brazil]], they are always made of gold, and there is no tradition for the engagement ring. Both men and women wear the wedding band on their right hand while engaged, and, after they marry, they shift the rings to their left hands. In [[Nordic countries]] such as [[Finland]] and [[Norway]], both men and women wear an engagement ring.

In the modern era, some women's wedding rings are made into two separate pieces. One part is given to her to wear as an engagement ring when she accepts the marriage proposal and the other during the wedding ceremony. When worn together, the two rings look like one piece of jewelry. {{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}

==Engagement parties==
{{Main|Engagement party}}
Some engagements are announced at an engagement party, traditionally hosted by the bride's parents. These parties are given in the family's usual style of entertainment.  Traditionally, engagement parties were normal parties at which a surprise announcement of the engagement was made by the father of the bride to his guests. Therefore, it is not a traditional gift-giving occasion since no guests were supposed to be aware of the engagement until after their arrival.

In modern times, engagement parties often celebrate a previously publicized engagement. Whether presents are given at these engagement parties varies from culture to culture.

[[File:gifts xmas.jpg|thumb|right|Gifts under a [[Christmas tree]]]]
[[File:Gift box.jpg|thumb|Red gift box]]

A '''gift''' or a '''present''' is an item given to someone without the expectation of payment. An item is not a gift, if that item, itself, is already owned by the one to whom it is given. Although gift-giving might involve an expectation of reciprocity, a gift is meant to be free. In many countries, the act of mutually exchanging [[money]], [[property|goods]], etc. may sustain social relations and contribute to social cohesion. Economists have elaborated the [[economics]] of gift-giving into the notion of a [[gift economy]]. By extension the term ''gift'' can refer to anything that makes the other [[happiness|happier]] or less sad, especially as a favor, including [[forgiveness]] and [[kindness]]. Gifts are also first and foremost presented on occasions - birthdays and [[Christmas]] being the main examples.

== Presentation ==
In many cultures gifts are traditionally packaged in some way. For example, in Western cultures, gifts are often wrapped in [[wrapping paper]] and accompanied by a [[gift note]] which may note the occasion, the recipient's name, and the giver's name. In Chinese culture, red wrapping connotes luck. Although inexpensive gifts are common among colleagues, associates and acquaintances, expensive or intimate gifts are considered more appropriate among close friends, romantic interests or relatives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Brigham|first1=John Carl|title=Social Psychology|date=1986|page=322}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Gift giving occasions  ==
Gift giving occasions may be:
* An expression of [[love]] or [[friendship]]
* An expression of [[gratitude]] for a gift received.
* An expression of [[piety]], in the form of [[alms|charity]].
* An expression of [[solidarity (sociology)|solidarity]], in the form of [[mutual aid (organization)|mutual aid]].
* To share wealth.
* To offset misfortune.
* Offering travel [[souvenir]]s.
* Custom, on occasions (often [[celebration (party)|celebrations]]) such as
** A [[birthday]] (the person who has his or her birthday gives [[cake]], etc. and/or receives gifts).
** A [[potlatch]], in societies where status is associated with gift-giving rather than acquisition.
** [[Christmas]] (throughout the history of Christmas gift giving, people have given one another gifts, often pretending they are left by [[Santa Claus]], the [[Christ child]] or [[Saint Nicholas]]).
** [[Feast of Saint Nicholas]] (people give each other gifts, often supposedly receiving them from Saint Nicholas).
** Easter baskets with chocolate eggs, jelly beans, and chocolate rabbits are gifts given on [[Easter]].
** [[Greek Orthodox Church|Greek Orthodox Christians]] in Greece, will give gifts to family and friends on the Feast of [[Saint Basil]].
** [[Muslims]] give gifts to family and friends, known as [[Eidi (gift)|Eidi]], on [[Eid al-Fitr]] (the end of [[Ramadan]]) and on [[Eid al-Adha]].
** [[Jews]] gives [[Hanukkah]] gifts to family and friends.
** [[Hindus]] give [[Diwali]] and [[Pongal]] gifts to family and friends.
** [[Buddhists]] give [[Vesak]] gifts to family and friends.
** Gifts are given to among [[African American]] families and friends on [[Kwanzaa]].
** A [[wedding]] (the couple receives gifts and gives [[food]] and/or [[drink]]s at the [[wedding reception]]).
** A [[wedding anniversary]] (each spouse receives gifts).
** A [[funeral]] (visitors bring flowers, the relatives of the deceased give food and/or drinks after the ceremonial part).
** A [[Childbirth|birth]] (the [[baby]] receives gifts, or the mother receives a gift from the father known as a [[push present]]).
** Passing an [[Test (assessment)|examination]] (the [[student]] receives gifts).
** [[Father's Day]] (the [[father]] receives gifts).
** [[Mother's Day]] (the [[mother]] receives gifts).
** Exchange of gifts between a guest and a host, often a traditional practice.
** [[Lagniappe]]
** [[Retirement]] Gifts
** [[:wikt:congratulations|Congratulations]] Gifts
** [[Engagement]] Gifts
** [[Housewarming party]]
** Ironically, gift giving also refers to an HIV negative person consensually receiving the HIV virus. See [[Bugchasing]].

== Legal aspects of gifts ==
{{Main|Gift (law)|Gift tax}}

At [[common law]], for a gift to have legal effect, it was required that there be (1) intent by the donor to give a gift, and (2) delivery to the recipient of the item to be given as a gift. 

In some countries, certain types of gifts above a certain monetary amount are subject to taxation.  For the United States, see [[Gift tax in the United States]].

In some contexts gift giving can be construed as [[bribery]].  This tends to occur in situations where the gift is given with an implicit or explicit agreement between the giver of the gift and its receiver that some type of service will be rendered (often outside of normal legitimate methods) because of the gift. Some groups, such as government workers, may have strict rules concerning gift giving and receiving so as to avoid the appearance of impropriety.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.oge.gov/Topics/Gifts-and-Payments/Gifts---Payments/&lt;/ref&gt;

== Religious views ==
[[Lewis Hyde]] remarks in ''The Gift'' that [[Christianity]] considers the [[Incarnation]] and subsequent death of [[Jesus]] to be the greatest gift to humankind, and that the [[Jataka]] contains a tale of the [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]] in his incarnation as the Wise Hare giving the ultimate [[alms]] by offering himself up as a meal for [[Śakra (Buddhism)|Sakka]]. (Hyde, 1983, 58-60)

In the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] the bread and wine that are [[consecrated]] during the [[Divine Liturgy]] are referred to as &quot;the Gifts.&quot; They are first of all the gifts of the community (both individually and corporately) to God, and then, after the [[epiklesis]], the Gifts of the [[Body of Christ|Body]] and [[Blood of Christ|Blood]] of [[Christ]] to the Church.

Ritual [[sacrifice]]s can be seen as return gifts to a [[deity]].

A '''textile'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/textile|title=Textile|publisher=Merriam-Webster|accessdate=2012-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; or '''cloth'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/cloth|title=Cloth|publisher=Merriam-Webster|accessdate=2012-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a flexible material consisting of a network of natural or artificial [[fibre]]s ([[yarn]] or [[Thread (yarn)|thread]]). Yarn is produced by [[Spinning (textiles)|spinning]] raw fibres of [[wool]], [[flax]], [[cotton]], or other material to produce long strands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = An Introduction to Textile Terms | url = http://www.textilemuseum.org/PDFs/TextileTerms.pdf  | format = PDF  | accessdate = August 6, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Textiles are formed by [[weaving]], [[knitting]], [[crochet]]ing, [[Macramé|knotting]], or [[felt]]ing.

The words '''''fabric''''' and ''cloth'' are used in textile assembly trades (such as [[tailor]]ing and [[dressmaker|dressmaking]]) as synonyms for ''textile''. However, there are subtle differences in these terms in specialized usage. ''Textile'' refers to any material made of interlacing fibres. ''Fabric'' refers to any material made through weaving, knitting, spreading, crocheting, or bonding that may be used in production of further goods (garments, etc.). ''Cloth'' may be used synonymously with ''fabric'' but often refers to a finished piece of fabric used for a specific purpose (e.g., ''table cloth'').

[[File:Otavalo Artisan Market - Andes Mountains - South America - photograph 001.JPG|thumb|right|[[Alpaca]] textile at the [[Otavalo (city)|Otavalo]] Artisan Market in the Andes Mountains, Ecuador]]

==Etymology==
The word 'textile' is from [[Latin]], from the adjective ''textilis'', meaning 'woven',  from ''textus'', the past participle of the verb ''texere'',  'to weave'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.thefreedictionary.com/textile|title=Textile|publisher=The Free Dictionary By Farlex|accessdate=2012-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The word 'fabric' also derives from Latin, most recently from the Middle [[French language|French]] ''fabrique'', or 'building, thing made', and earlier as the Latin ''fabrica'' 'workshop; an art, trade; a skillful production, structure, fabric', which is from the Latin ''faber'', or 'artisan who works in hard materials', from [[Proto-Indo-European language|PIE]] ''dhabh-'', meaning 'to fit together'.&lt;ref&gt;{{OEtymD|fabric|accessdate=2012-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The word 'cloth' derives from the [[Old English]] ''clað'', meaning a ''cloth, woven or felted material to wrap around one'', from Proto-Germanic ''kalithaz'' (compare O.Frisian 'klath', Middle [[Dutch language|Dutch]] 'cleet', Dutch 'kleed', Middle High German 'kleit', and German 'kleid', all meaning &quot;garment&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;{{OEtymD|cloth|accessdate=2012-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
{{Main|History of clothing and textiles}}

The discovery of dyed flax fibres in a cave in the [[Georgia (country)|Republic of Georgia]] dated to 34,000 [[BCE]] suggests textile-like materials were made even in prehistoric times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1126/science.325_1329a|pmid=19745126|title=Clothes Make the (Hu) Man|year=2009|last1=Balter|first1=M.|journal=Science|volume=325|issue=5946|pages=1329}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1126/science.1175404|pmid= 19745144|title=30,000-Year-Old Wild Flax Fibers|year=2009|last1=Kvavadze|first1=E.|last2=Bar-Yosef|first2=O.|last3=Belfer-Cohen|first3=A.|last4=Boaretto|first4=E.|last5=Jakeli|first5=N.|last6=Matskevich|first6=Z.|last7=Meshveliani|first7=T.|journal=Science|volume=325|issue=5946|pages=1359}} [http://worldtextile.aimoo.com/ Supporting Online Material]&lt;/ref&gt;

The production of textiles is a craft whose speed and scale of production has been altered almost beyond recognition by industrialization and the introduction of modern manufacturing techniques. However, for the main types of textiles, [[plain weave]], [[twill]], or [[satin weave]], there is little difference between the ancient and modern methods.

== Uses ==
Textiles have an assortment of uses, the most common of which are for [[clothing]] and for containers such as bags and [[basket]]s. In the household they are used in [[carpet]]ing, upholstered [[furniture|furnishings]], [[window shade]]s, [[towel]]s, coverings for tables, beds, and other flat surfaces, and in [[art]]. In the workplace they are used in industrial and scientific processes such as filtering. Miscellaneous uses include [[flag]]s, [[backpack]]s, [[tent]]s, [[Net (device)|net]]s, [[handkerchief]]s, cleaning [[wikt:rag|rag]]s, [[transportation]] devices such as [[balloon]]s, [[kite flying|kite]]s, [[sail]]s, and [[parachute]]s; textiles are also used to provide strengthening in [[composite material]]s such as [[fiberglass|fibreglass]] and industrial [[geotextile]]s. Textiles are used in many traditional crafts such as [[sewing]], [[quilting]]  and [[embroidery]].

Textiles for industrial purposes, and chosen for characteristics other than their appearance, are commonly referred to as ''[[technical textiles]].'' Technical textiles include textile structures for automotive applications, medical textiles (e.g. implants), geotextiles (reinforcement of embankments), agrotextiles (textiles for [[crop protection]]), protective clothing (e.g. against heat and radiation for fire fighter clothing, against molten metals for welders, stab protection, and [[bullet]] proof vests). In all these applications stringent performance requirements must be met. Woven of threads coated with [[zinc oxide]] [[nanowire]]s, laboratory fabric has been shown capable of &quot;self-powering nanosystems&quot; using vibrations created by everyday actions like wind or body movements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Keim, Brandon |title=Piezoelectric Nanowires Turn Fabric Into Power Source|url=http://blog.wired.com/wiredscience/2008/02/piezoelectric-n.html|date=February 13, 2008|work=Wired News|publisher=CondéNet|accessdate=2008-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Yong Qin, Xudong Wang &amp; Zhong Lin Wang|title=Letter/abstract: Microfibre–nanowire hybrid structure for energy scavenging|url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v451/n7180/full/nature06601.html|journal=Nature|volume=451|pages=809–813|publisher=Nature Publishing Group|doi=10.1038/nature06601|date=October 10, 2007|accessdate=2008-02-13|pmid=18273015|issue=7180}} cited in {{cite web|title=Editor's summary: Nanomaterial: power dresser|url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v451/n7180/edsumm/e080214-06.html|work=Nature|publisher=Nature Publishing Group|date=February 14, 2008|accessdate=2008-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Fashion and textile designers ==
Fashion designers commonly rely on textile designs to set their fashion collections apart from others. [[Armani]], the late [[Gianni Versace]], and [[Emilio Pucci]] can be easily recognized by their signature print driven designs.

== Sources and types ==
Textiles can be made from many materials. These materials come from four main sources: animal ([[wool]], [[silk]]), plant ([[cotton]], [[flax]], [[jute]]), mineral ([[asbestos]], [[glass (fiber)|glass fibre]]), and synthetic ([[nylon]], [[polyester]], [[Acrylic fiber|acrylic]]). In the past, all textiles were made from natural fibres, including plant, animal, and mineral sources. In the 20th century, these were supplemented by artificial fibres made from [[petroleum]].

Textiles are made in various strengths and degrees of durability, from the finest [[Textile manufacturing terminology|gossamer]] to the sturdiest [[canvas]]. [[Microfibre]] refers to fibres made of strands thinner than one denier.

=== Animal textiles ===
Animal textiles are commonly made from [[hair]], [[fur]], [[skin]] or [[silk]] (in the silkworms case).

[[Wool]] refers to the hair of the domestic [[goat]] or [[sheep]], which is distinguished from other types of animal hair in that the individual strands are coated with scales and tightly crimped, and the wool as a whole is coated with a [[wax]] mixture known as [[lanolin]] (sometimes called wool grease), which is waterproof and dirtproof {{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}. [[Woollen]] refers to a bulkier yarn produced from carded, non-parallel fibre, while [[worsted]] refers to a finer yarn spun from longer fibres which have been combed to be parallel. Wool is commonly used for warm clothing. [[Cashmere wool|Cashmere]], the hair of the Indian [[cashmere goat]], and [[mohair]], the hair of the North African [[angora goat]], are types of wool known for their softness.

Other animal textiles which are made from hair or fur are alpaca wool, [[Vicuña|vicuña wool]], llama wool, and camel hair, generally used in the production of [[Coat (clothing)|coat]]s, [[jacket]]s, [[poncho]]s, [[blanket]]s, and other warm coverings. [[Angora wool|Angora]] refers to the long, thick, soft hair of the [[angora rabbit]].  [[Qiviut]] is the fine inner wool of the [[muskox]].

[[Wadmal]] is a coarse cloth made of wool, produced in Scandinavia, mostly 1000~1500 CE.

Silk is an animal textile made from the fibres of the [[Cocoon (silk)|cocoon]] of the Chinese [[silkworm]] which is spun into a smooth fabric prized for its softness.  There are two main types of the silk: 'mulberry silk' produced by the Bombyx Mori, and 'wild silk' such as Tussah silk. Silkworm larvae produce the first type if cultivated in habitats with fresh mulberry leaves for consumption, while Tussah silk is produced by silkworms feeding purely on oak leaves. Around four-fifths of the world's silk production consists of cultivated silk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Trevisan|first=Adrian|title=Cocoon Silk: A Natural Silk Architecture|url=http://www.senature.com/research/publications/cocoon-silk-a-natural-architecture|publisher=Sense of Nature}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Plant textiles ===
[[Poaceae|Grass]], [[Juncaceae|rush]], [[hemp]], and [[sisal]] are all used in making [[rope]]. In the first two, the entire plant is used for this purpose, while in the last two, only fibres from the plant are utilized. [[Coir]] ([[coconut]] fibre) is used in making [[twine]], and also in floormats, [[Mat|doormats]], [[brush]]es, [[mattress]]es, floor tiles, and [[Bag|sacking]].

[[Straw]] and [[bamboo textiles|bamboo]] are both used to make hats. Straw, a dried form of grass, is also used for stuffing, as is [[kapok]].

Fibres from [[pulpwood]] trees, cotton, [[rice paper|rice]], hemp, and [[Urtica dioica|nettle]] are used in making [[paper]].

[[Cotton]], flax, jute, hemp, [[Modal (textile)|modal]] and even bamboo fibre are all used in clothing. [[Piña]] ([[pineapple]] fibre) and [[ramie]] are also fibres used in clothing, generally with a blend of other fibres such as cotton. Nettles have also been used to make a fibre and fabric very similar to hemp or flax. The use of milkweed stalk fibre has also been reported, but it tends to be somewhat weaker than other fibres like hemp or flax.

The inner bark of the [[Lagetta lagetto|lacebark tree]] is a fine netting that has been used to make clothing and accessories as well as utilitarian articles such as rope.

[[cellulose acetate|Acetate]] is used to increase the shininess of certain fabrics such as silks, [[velvet]]s, and [[taffeta]]s.

[[Seaweed]] is used in the production of textiles: a water-soluble fibre known as [[Alginic acid|alginate]] is produced and is used as a holding fibre; when the cloth is finished, the alginate is dissolved, leaving an open area.

[[Lyocell]] is a synthetic fabric derived from wood pulp. It is often described as a synthetic silk
equivalent; it is a tough fabric that is often blended with other fabrics – cotton, for example.

Fibres from the stalks of plants, such as hemp, flax, and nettles, are also known as 'bast' fibres.

=== Mineral textiles ===
Asbestos and [[basalt fibre]] are used for vinyl tiles, sheeting, and adhesives, &quot;transite&quot; panels and siding, acoustical ceilings, stage curtains, and fire blankets.

Glass fibre is used in the production of ironing board and mattress covers, ropes and cables, reinforcement fibre for composite materials, insect netting, flame-retardant and protective fabric, soundproof, fireproof, and insulating fibres. Glass fibres are woven and coated with [[Teflon]] to produce [[beta cloth]], a virtually fireproof fabric which replaced nylon in the outer layer of United States [[space suit]]s since 1968.

Metal fibre, metal foil, and metal wire have a variety of uses, including the production of [[cloth-of-gold]] and [[jewellery]]. [[Hardware cloth]] (US term only) is a coarse woven [[mesh]] of steel wire, used in construction. It is much like standard [[window screen]]ing, but heavier and with a more open weave. It is sometimes used together with screening on the lower part of screen doors, to resist scratching by dogs. It serves similar purposes as [[chicken wire]], such as [[fence]]s for [[poultry]] and traps for [[Pest control|animal control]].

All synthetic textiles are used primarily in the production of clothing.

[[Polyester]] fibre is used in all types of clothing, either alone or blended with fibres such as cotton.

[[Aramid]] fibre (e.g. [[Twaron]]) is used for flame-retardant clothing, cut-protection, and armor.

[[Acrylic fibre|Acrylic]] is a fibre used to imitate wools, including cashmere, and is often used in replacement of them.

Nylon is a fibre used to imitate silk; it is used in the production of [[pantyhose]].  Thicker nylon fibres are used in [[rope]] and outdoor clothing.

[[Spandex]] (trade name ''Lycra'') is a [[polyurethane]] product that can be made tight-fitting without impeding movement.  It is used to make activewear, [[Brassiere|bra]]s, and [[swimsuit]]s.

[[Olefin fibre]] is a fibre used in activewear, linings, and warm clothing.  Olefins are hydrophobic, allowing them to dry quickly.  A sintered felt of olefin fibres is sold under the trade name [[Tyvek]].

[[Ingeo]] is a [[polylactide]] fibre blended with other fibres such as cotton and used in clothing.  It is more hydrophilic than most other synthetics, allowing it to wick away perspiration.

[[Lurex (yarn)|Lurex]] is a metallic fibre used in clothing embellishment.

[[Milk]] proteins have also been used to create synthetic fabric. Milk or [[casein]] fibre cloth was developed during [[World War I]] in Germany, and further developed in Italy and America during the 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;Euroflax Industries Ltd. [http://euroflax.com/products_imports%20of_textiles.htm &quot;Euroflaxx Industries (Import of Textiles)&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt; Milk fibre fabric is not very durable and wrinkles easily, but has a pH similar to human skin and possesses anti-bacterial properties. It is marketed as a [[biodegradation|biodegradable]], [[renewable resource|renewable]] synthetic fibre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Fonte, Diwata|title=Milk-fabric clothing raises a few eyebrows|url=http://www.textile-technology.com/2010/04/milk-fabric-clothing-raises-a-few-eyebrows/|date=August 23, 2005|work=The Orange County Register|accessdate=2009-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Carbon fibre]] is mostly used in composite materials, together with resin, such as [[carbon fibre reinforced plastic]]. The fibres are made from polymer fibres through carbonization.

[[Weaving]] is a textile production method which involves interlacing a set of longer [[Yarn|threads]] (called the [[warp (weaving)|warp]]) with a set of crossing threads (called the [[weft]]). This is done on a frame or machine known as a [[loom]], of which there are a number of types. Some weaving is still done by hand, but the vast majority is mechanised.

[[Knitting]] and [[crochet]]ing involve interlacing loops of yarn, which are formed either on a [[knitting needle]] or on a [[crochet hook]], together in a line. The two processes are different in that knitting has several active loops at one time, on the knitting needle waiting to interlock with another loop, while crocheting never has more than one active loop on the needle. Knitting can be performed by machine, but crochet can only be performed by hand.

[[Spread Tow]] is a production method where the yarn are spread into thin tapes, and then the tapes are woven as warp and weft. This method is mostly used for composite materials; [[Spread Tow Fabrics]] can be made in [[carbon]], [[aramide]], etc.

[[Braid]]ing or plaiting involves twisting threads together into cloth. Knotting involves tying threads together and is used in making [[macrame]].

[[Lace]] is made by interlocking threads together independently, using a backing and any of the methods described above, to create a fine fabric with open holes in the work. Lace can be made by either hand or machine.

[[Carpet]]s, rugs, velvet, [[velour]], and [[velveteen]] are made by interlacing a secondary yarn through woven cloth, creating a tufted layer known as a [[nap (textile)|nap]] or [[pile (textile)|pile]].

Felting involves pressing a mat of fibres together, and working them together until they become tangled.  A liquid, such as soapy water, is usually added to lubricate the fibres, and to open up the microscopic scales on strands of wool.

[[Nonwoven]] textiles are manufactured by the bonding of fibres to make fabric. Bonding may be thermal or mechanical, or adhesives can be used.

[[Barkcloth|Bark cloth]] is made by pounding bark until it is soft and flat.

== Treatments ==
Textiles are often [[dyeing|dyed]], with fabrics available in almost every colour. The dying process often requires several dozen gallons of water for each pound of clothing.&lt;ref&gt;Green Inc. Blog [http://greeninc.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/07/21/cutting-water-use-in-the-textile-industry/ &quot;Cutting Water Use in the Textile Industry.&quot;] ''[[The New York Times]]''. July 21, 2009. July 28, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Coloured designs in textiles can be created by weaving together fibres of different colours ([[tartan]] or Uzbek Ikat), adding coloured stitches to finished fabric ([[embroidery]]), creating patterns by [[resist dyeing]] methods, tying off areas of cloth and dyeing the rest ([[tie-dyeing]]), or drawing wax designs on cloth and dyeing in between them ([[batik]]), or using various printing processes on finished fabric. [[Woodblock printing]], still used in India and elsewhere today, is the oldest of these dating back to at least 220 CE in [[China]].  Textiles are also sometimes [[bleach]]ed, making the textile pale or white.

[[File:GuatemalaWeavings79.jpg|thumb|180px|right|Brilliantly dyed traditional woven textiles of [[Guatemala]], and woman weaving on a backstrap [[loom]].]]
Textiles are sometimes finished by chemical processes to change their characteristics. In the 19th century and early 20th century [[starch]]ing was commonly used to make clothing more resistant to stains and wrinkles. Since the 1990s, with advances in technologies such as [[permanent press]] process, [[Finishing (textiles)|finishing]] agents have been used to strengthen fabrics and make them wrinkle free.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ask.yahoo.com/ask/20010315.html |title=What makes fabric &quot;wrinkle-free&quot;? Is it the weave or a special type of fiber?|publisher=Ask.yahoo.com |date=2001-03-15 |accessdate=2011-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, nanomaterials research has led to additional advancements, with companies such as Nano-Tex and NanoHorizons developing permanent treatments based on metallic [[nanoparticle]]s for making textiles more resistant to things such as water, stains, wrinkles, and pathogens such as bacteria and fungi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tms.org/pubs/journals/jom/0507/byko-0507.html |title=The Materials Science and Engineering of Clothing |publisher=Tms.org |accessdate=2011-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More so today than ever before, textiles receive a range of treatments before they reach the end-user. From formaldehyde finishes (to improve crease-resistance) to biocidic finishes and from flame retardants to dyeing of many types of fabric, the possibilities are almost endless. However, many of these finishes may also have detrimental effects on the end user. A number of disperse, acid and reactive dyes (for example) have been shown to be allergenic to sensitive individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1111/j.1468-3083.2004.00967.x|title=Textile dermatitis in patients with contact sensitization in Israel: A 4-year prospective study|year=2004|last1=Lazarov|first1=A|journal=Journal of the European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology|volume=18|issue=5|pages=531–7|pmid=15324387}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further to this, specific dyes within this group have also been shown to induce purpuric contact dermatitis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=12952748|year=2003|last1=Lazarov|first1=A|last2=Cordoba|first2=M|last3=Plosk|first3=N|last4=Abraham|first4=D|title=Atypical and unusual clinical manifestations of contact dermatitis to clothing (textile contact dermatitis): Case presentation and review of the literature|volume=9|issue=3|pages=1|journal=Dermatology online journal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although formaldehyde levels in clothing are unlikely to be at levels high enough to cause an allergic reaction,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=9687033|year=1998|last1=Scheman|first1=AJ|last2=Carroll|first2=PA|last3=Brown|first3=KH|last4=Osburn|first4=AH|title=Formaldehyde-related textile allergy: An update|volume=38|issue=6|pages=332–6|journal=Contact dermatitis|doi=10.1111/j.1600-0536.1998.tb05769.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; due to the presence of such a chemical, quality control and testing are of utmost importance. Flame retardants (mainly in the brominated form) are also of concern where the environment, and their potential toxicity, are concerned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.elsevier.com/authored_subject_sections/P09/pdf/EI-cited-97-times.pdf|doi=10.1016/S0160-4120(03)00121-1|title=An overview of commercially used brominated flame retardants, their applications, their use patterns in different countries/regions and possible modes of release|year=2003|last1=Alaee|first1=M|journal=Environment International|volume=29|issue=6|pages=683–9|pmid=12850087|last2=Arias|first2=P|last3=Sjödin|first3=A|last4=Bergman|first4=A}}&lt;/ref&gt; Testing for these additives is possible at a number of commercial laboratories, it is also possible to have textiles tested for according to the [[Oeko-tex]] certification standard which contains limits levels for the use of certain chemicals in textiles products.

'''Brunch''' is a combination of breakfast and lunch eaten usually during the late morning but it can extend to as late as 3pm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Palmatier|first=Robert Alan|title=Food: A Dictionary of Literal and Nonliteral Terms|year=2000|publisher=Greenwood  Press|isbn=978-0313314360|page=40|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OqIe3YFwsFkC&amp;pg=PA40 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.memidex.com/brunch+meal |title=brunch (meal) |work=Memidex/WordNet Dictionary |accessdate=25 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word is a [[portmanteau]] of ''breakfast'' and ''lunch''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.foodnetwork.com/food/web/encyclopedia/termdetail/0,7770,667,00.html |title=foodnetwork |publisher=Web.foodnetwork.com |date= |accessdate=24 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brunch originated in England in the late 19th century and became popular in the United States in the 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yrTKLHbl4TkC&amp;pg=PA8 | title=Joy of Cooking: All About Breakfast and Brunch | publisher=Simon and Schuster | author=Rombauer, Irma S.; Becker, Marion Rombauer; Becker, Ethan | year=2001 | pages=8 | isbn=0743206428}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin of the word==
The 1896 supplement to the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' cites ''[[Punch (magazine)|Punch]]'' magazine which wrote that the term was coined in Britain in 1895 to describe a Sunday meal for &quot;Saturday-night carousers&quot; in the writer Guy Beringer's article &quot;Brunch: A Plea&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gold|first=David L.|title=Studies in etymology and etiology|year=2009|publisher=Universidad de Alicante|isbn=978-84-7908-517-9|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=l015C5vm1XkC&amp;pg=PA99&amp;dq=brunch+%22Guy+beringer%22#v=onepage&amp;q=brunch%20%22Guy%20beringer%22&amp;f=false|page=99}}&lt;/ref&gt; in ''Hunter's Weekly'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Merriam-Webster's, Inc.|title=Merriam-Webster's dictionary of English usage|year=1994|publisher=Merrriam Webster|isbn=978-0-87779-132-4|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2yJusP0vrdgC&amp;pg=PA203&amp;dq=brunch+%22Guy+beringer%22#v=onepage&amp;q=brunch%20%22Guy%20beringer%22&amp;f=false|page=203}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quotation|Instead of England's early Sunday dinner, a postchurch ordeal of heavy meats and savory pies, why not a new meal, served around noon, that starts with tea or coffee, marmalade and other breakfast fixtures before moving along to the heavier fare? By eliminating the need to get up early on Sunday, brunch would make life brighter for Saturday-night carousers. It would promote human happiness in other ways as well. &quot;Brunch is cheerful, sociable and inciting.&quot; Beringer wrote. &quot;It is talk-compelling. It puts you in a good temper, it makes you satisfied with yourself and your fellow beings, it sweeps away the worries and cobwebs of the week.&quot;|
William Grimes, &quot;At Brunch, The More Bizarre The Better&quot; ''New York Times'', 1998&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Grimes, William |url=http://www.nytimes.com/1998/07/08/dining/at-brunch-the-more-bizarre-the-better.html?sec=travel&amp;pagewanted=1 |title=At Brunch, The More Bizarre The Better |work=The New York Times |date=8 July 1998 |accessdate=24 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

It is sometimes credited to reporter Frank Ward O'Malley who wrote for the [[New York]] newspaper ''[[The Sun (New York)|The Sun]]'' from 1906 until 1919,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Press: O'Malley of the Sun|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,769750,00.html|accessdate=9 September 2011|work=Time Magazine|date=31 October 1932}}&lt;/ref&gt; allegedly based on the typical mid-day eating habits of a newspaper reporter.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;As to who coined the word brunch, that, too, is unclear. According to an American Dialect Society site, Frank Ward O'Malley, an old style reporter with the New York Morning Sun (1906–1919), was the first to use &quot;brunch&quot; to describe the morning newspaper man's breakfast-luncheon combination.&quot; [http://travelvideo.tv/news/more.php?id=A11326_0_1_0_M Mother's Day and the history of &quot;Brunch&quot; – Thousands of Ontarians take their mothers to brunch on Mother's Day] Travel TV&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pietrusza, David ''Rothstein: The Life, Times, and Murder of the Criminal Genius'' [https://books.google.com/books?id=a4O6gNUDnj8C&amp;pg=PA34&amp;lpg=PA34&amp;dq=Frank+Ward+O%27Malley+brunch&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=THJXQveRRE&amp;sig=ISzbwOU1oQV4uihwWw1VhmU-qsU&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ct=result Google Books link] 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

==At colleges and hostels==
Some [[college]]s and [[hostel]]s serve brunch, especially on Sundays and holidays.  Such brunches are often serve-yourself [[buffet]]s, but [[menu]]-ordered meals may be available instead of, or with, the buffet.  The meal usually involves standard breakfast foods such as [[Egg (food)|eggs]], [[sausage]]s, [[bacon]], [[ham]], [[fruit]]s, [[pastries]], [[pancake]]s, and the like.

==Military==
The United States military often serves weekend brunch in the dining facilities. They offer both breakfast and lunch options and are open from about 09:00-13:00 (though times vary).

==Dim sum brunch==
The [[dim sum]] brunch is popular in Chinese restaurants worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://chinesefood.about.com/od/diningout/p/dim_sum.htm |title=Dim Sum – History, Pictures, Recipes of Chinese Dim Sum |publisher=Chinesefood.about.com |date=13 July 2013 |accessdate=24 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It consists of a variety of stuffed buns, [[dumplings]], and other savory or sweet food items that have been steamed, deep-fried, or baked.  Customers pick small portions from passing carts, as the kitchen continuously produces and sends out more freshly prepared dishes.  Dim sum is usually eaten at a mid-morning, midday, or mid-afternoon [[teatime]].

== Special occasions ==
Brunch is prepared by restaurants and hotels for special occasions, such as weddings, [[Valentine's Day]], [[Mother's Day]], or [[Easter Sunday]].

==In other languages==
[[File:Brunch1.jpg|thumb|A brunch service]]

===French===
The [[Office québécois de la langue française]] accepts &quot;brunch&quot; as a valid word but also provides a synonym ''déjeuner-buffet''. Note that, however, in [[Quebec]], ''déjeuner'' alone (even without the qualifying adjective ''petit'') means &quot;breakfast&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Office de la langue française, 1999, '[http://www.granddictionnaire.com/BTML/FRA/r_Motclef/index800_1.asp Le Grand Dictionnaire]'', entry &quot;Brunch&quot;: &quot;Repas combinant le petit déjeuner et le repas du midi, et habituellement constitué d'un buffet&quot;. (A meal that combines the breakfast and lunch and usually consists of a buffet.)&lt;/ref&gt; In Quebec, the word—when [[Francization|Francized]]—is pronounced {{IPA-fr|bʁɔ̃ʃ|}}.&lt;ref&gt;''La Petite Larousse'' (2009), p. 140&lt;/ref&gt;

===German===
German-speaking countries readily adopt [[Anglicism]]s, and &quot;brunch&quot; is no exception, defining it as &quot;a combination of breakfast and lunch.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[:de:Brunch]] Deutsch Wiki entry on &quot;brunch&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Chinese'''

Chinese word &quot;旱饭” is defined as breakfast and lunch, taking the meaning of &quot;干“，which can also be interpreted as lunch in some parts of China.

== Other places ==

=== Dubai, United Arab Emirates ===

'Friday Brunch' is considered&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/departures-magazine/friday-brunch-in-dubai_b_2638125.html |title= Dubai's Outlandish Brunch Culture  | publisher=Huffington Post | date=9 February 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; something of an institution in [[Dubai]]. Many large hotels and restaurants offer an all inclusive drinks and food buffet during early afternoons, and large groups of expatriates and tourists make this the highlight of their weekend, with parties going on well into the night.

=== Canada ===
In many regions of Canada, in particular in [[Southern Ontario]], brunch is popular on Sundays when families will often host relatives or friends in their [[dining room]]. The typical brunch can last a few hours and go late into the afternoon. [[Montreal-style bagel]]s may be served alongside egg dishes, waffles or crepes, smoked meat or fish, fruit, salads, cheese, and dessert. Often, champagne or wine will be served and following the meal tea or coffee is usually consumed.{{Citation needed|date=August 2015}}

Many restaurants offer brunch service as well, and the [[Leslieville]] neighbourhood of Toronto is sometimes called the brunch capital of [[Toronto]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mydestination.com/toronto/restaurants/125502/bonjour-brioche |title=Bonjour Brioche in Leslieville - My Destination Toronto |publisher=Mydestination.com |date= |accessdate=24 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; as many renowned establishments serve brunch in that neighbourhood.

This twill weaving produces the familiar diagonal ribbing of the denim that distinguishes it from [[cotton duck]] (a linen canvas).

It is a characteristic of most [[Indigo dye|indigo denim]] that only the [[Warp (weaving)|warp]] threads are dyed, whereas the [[weft]] threads remain plain white. As a result of the warp-faced [[twill]] weaving, one side of the textile then shows the blue warp threads and the other side shows the white weft threads. This is why [[Jeans|blue jeans]] are white on the inside. The indigo dyeing process, in which the core of the warp threads remains white, creates denim's fading characteristics, which are unique compared to every other textile.

==Etymology and origin==
The name &quot;denim&quot; derives {{ety|fr|serge de Nîmes|[[Serge (fabric)|serge]] from [[Nîmes]]}}.&lt;ref&gt;In 1789 George Washington toured a [[Beverly, Massachusetts]] factory producing machine-woven cotton denim. ([http://www.massmoments.org/moment.cfm?mid=314 Massachusetts Foundation for the Humanities: Mass Moments]{{Clarify|date=August 2010}}).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://inventors.about.com/od/sstartinventors/a/Levi_Strauss.htm |title= Levi Strauss - The History of Blue Jeans |first=Mary| last=Bellis |work=About.com |quote= &quot;Levi Strauss had the canvas made into waist overalls. Miners liked the pants, but complained that they tended to chafe. Levi Strauss substituted a twilled cotton cloth from France called &quot;serge de Nimes.&quot; The fabric later became known as denim and the pants were nicknamed blue jeans.&quot; In French of Nimes or De Nimes shortened to Denim |accessdate=2015-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Denim was traditionally colored blue with [[indigo dye]] to make [[Jeans|blue jeans]], although &quot;jean&quot; formerly denoted a different, lighter, cotton fabric. The contemporary use of the word &quot;jeans&quot; comes from the French word for [[Genoa]], [[Italy]] (Gênes),&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC&quot;/&gt; where the first denim [[trousers]] were made. Denim has been used in the USA since the mid 19th century. Denim initially gained popularity in 1873 when, Jacob Davis, a tailor from Nevada, manufactured the first pair of “rivet-reinforced” denim pants.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Fashioning the historical body: the political economy of denim|url = http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10350331003722851|journal = Social Semiotics|date = 2010-06-01|issn = 1035-0330|pages = 293–308|volume = 20|issue = 3|doi = 10.1080/10350331003722851|first = James B.|last = Salazar}}&lt;/ref&gt; His concept for making reinforced jeans was inspired when a lady customer requested a pair of durable and strong pants for her husband to chop wood. When Davis was about to finish making the denim jeans, he saw some copper rivets lying on a table and used the rivets to fasten the pockets. At this time, clothes for Western labourers, such as teamsters, surveyors, and miners, were not very durable.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt; Soon, the popularity of denim jeans began to spread rapidly and Davis was overwhelmed with requests. He soon sold 200 pairs to workers in need of heavy work clothing.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt; Nevertheless, because of the production capacity in his small shop, Davis was struggling to keep up with the demand . He then wrote a proposal to the dry goods wholesaler Levi Strauss &amp; Co. that had been supplying Davis with bolts of denim fabric.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt; Davis’s proposal was “to patent the design of the rivet-reinforced denim pant, with Davis listed as inventor, in exchange for certain rights of manufacture”.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt; Levi Strauss &amp; Co. was so impressed by the possibilities for profit in the manufacture of the garment that they then hired Davis to be in charge of the mass-production in San Francisco.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;

==Dry or raw denim==
{{see also|Stone washing}}
'''Dry''' or '''raw denim''' (contrasted with &quot;washed denim&quot;) is denim that is not washed after having been dyed during production.
[[File:Denim Fibers.jpg||thumb|right|Denim fibers from an old pair of jeans through a microscope]]
Over time, dry denim will usually fade, which is considered desirable by some people. During the process of wear, fading will usually occur on those parts of the article that receive the most stress. On a pair of jeans, this includes the upper thighs, the ankles, and the areas behind the knees.

After being made into an article of clothing, most denim articles are washed to make them softer and to reduce or eliminate [[Shrinkage (fabric)|shrinkage]] (which could cause the article to not fit properly after its owner washes it). In addition to being washed, &quot;washed denim&quot; is sometimes artificially distressed to produce a &quot;worn&quot; look. Much of the appeal of artificially distressed denim is that it resembles dry denim which has faded. In jeans made from dry denim, such fading is affected by the body of the person who wears them and by the activities of their daily life. This process creates what many enthusiasts feel to be a look more &quot;natural&quot; than artificially distressed denim.&lt;ref name=&quot;100th&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.heddels.com/2011/09/the-essential-raw-denim-breakdown-our-100th-article/|title = The Essential Raw Denim Breakdown – Our 100th Article!|first = Nick|last = Coe|work = Heddels.com|quote = ...a pair of raw denim is like an individualized canvass. Indeed the fade results and any other visible marks, rips, or tears are specific you and your body ...|accessdate = 2015-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To facilitate the natural distressing process, some wearers of dry denim will abstain from washing their jeans for more than six months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.heddels.com/2012/01/when-should-i-wash-my-jeans-a-rough-guide/|title = When Should I Wash My Raw Jeans? – A Rough Guide|first = Sean|last = Slater|work = Heddels.com|accessdate = 2015-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Most dry denim is made with 100% cotton and comes from several different countries. In particular, the United States, Zimbabwe and Japan are popular sources of cotton for making raw denim.&lt;ref name=&quot;100th&quot;/&gt;

Dry denim also varies in weight, typically measured in by the weight of a yard of denim in ounces. 12 Oz. or less is considered light denim, 12 Oz. to 16 Oz. is considered mid-weight, and over 16 Oz. is considered heavy weight. Heavier denim is much more rigid and resistant to wear, but can also take more wears to break in and feel comfortable.&lt;ref name=&quot;100th&quot;/&gt;

===Patterns of fading===
[[File:Raw denim honeycomb fades.jpg|thumb|upright||Natural &quot;honeycomb&quot; fades]]
Patterns of fading in jeans, caused by prolonged periods of wearing them without washing, have become the main allure of dry denim. Such patterns are a way of &quot;personalizing&quot; the garment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.handlebarmagazine.com/2011/09/denim-dialogues-vol-ii-making-them-your-own/ |title=Denim Dialogues, Vol. II: Making Them Your Own |first=Yang-Yi |last=Goh |work=Handlebar Magazine |date=2011-09-12 |accessdate=2015-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These patterns have specific names:
* Combs or honeycombs – These are faded lines that are found behind the knees.
* Whiskers – Faded streaks that surround the crotch area of the jeans.
* Stacks – These are created by having the inseam of the jeans hemmed a few inches longer than the actual leg length. The extra fabric then stacks on top of the shoe, causing a faded area to form around the ankle, extending up to the calf area.
* Train tracks – These appear on the outseams of the denim. This pattern showcases the selvage by forming two parallel lines of fades which resemble train tracks.

==Selvedge/selvage denim==
[[File:Naked and Famous selvedge jeans.jpg|thumb|Denim jeans showing the selvedge of the fabric joined to make a seam]]

''Selvedge'', or ''selvage'' (both spellings are correct), is the edge of a fabric as it comes from the [[loom]]. Selvedges are woven or knit so that they will not fray, ravel, or curl.

''Selvedge denim'' refers to a unique type of selvedge that is made by means of using one continuous cross-yarn (the [[weft]]), which is passed back and forth through the vertical [[Warp (weaving)|warp]] beams. This is traditionally finished at both edges with a contrasting warp (most commonly red); that is why this type of denim is sometimes referred to as &quot;red selvedge.&quot; This method of weaving the selvage is possible only when using a [[Loom|shuttle loom]].

[[Shuttle loom]]s weave a narrower 30-inch fabric, which is on average half the width of modern shuttleless [[Sulzer (manufacturer)|Sulzer looms]]. Consequently, a longer piece of fabric is required to make a pair of jeans from selvedge denim (approximately three yards).

To maximize yield, most jeans are made from wide denim and have a straight outseam that utilizes the full width of the fabric, including the edges. Selvedge denim has come to be associated with premium quality jeans, which show the finished edges from the loom rather than the overlocked edges that are shown on other jeans.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}

A detailed look at selvedge denim. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://toddshelton.com/blog/jeans/selvage-denim}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dyeing==
Denim was originally dyed with a dye produced from the plant ''[[Indigofera|Indigofera tinctoria]]'', but most denim today is dyed with synthetic [[indigo dye]]. In both cases, the yarn undergoes a repeated sequence of dipping and oxidation — the more dips, the stronger the color of the indigo.

Rope dyeing is considered the best yarn-dyeing method, as it eliminates shading across the fabric width.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}} The alternative &quot;slasher process&quot; is cheaper because only one beaming process is needed. In rope dyeing, beaming is done twice.

==Colored denim==
Denim fabric dyeing is divided into two categories: [[indigo dye]]ing and [[sulfur dye]]ing. Indigo dyeing produces the traditional blue color or shades similar to it. Sulfur dyeing produces speciality black colors and other colors, such as red, pink, purple, grey, rust, mustard, and green.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Stretch denim==
Stretch denim incorporates an [[Elastomer|elastic component]], such as [[spandex]]. This creates a certain amount of &quot;give&quot; in garments made from stretch denim.

Only a small percentage (about 3%) of spandex is required within the fabric to create a significant stretching capacity of about 15%. However, this feature will shorten the wearing life of the garment.

[[File:1974 AMC Gremlin with Levi’s option at 2015 AMO show 1of5.jpg|thumb|right|[[AMC Gremlin]] with Levi's trim and upholstery]]
Starting with the 1973 model year, [[American Motors|American Motors Corporation]] (AMC) offered a regular production option consisting of a [[Levi's]] interior trim package.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=VNQDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA119&amp;dq=Levi's+interior+scheme+blue-jean+material+that+looks+just+like+the+real+thing+copper+rivets |last=Lamm |first=Michael |title=AMC: Hornet hatchback leads the lineup |journal=Popular Mechanics |volume=138 |issue=4 |pages=118–119 |date=October 1972 |accessdate=2015-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over the years it was available on the [[AMC Gremlin|Gremlin]], [[AMC Hornet|Hornet]], and [[AMC Pacer|Pacer]], as well as [[Jeep]] models.

Although the car's jean material looks just like the real thing, AMC used spun nylon that was made to imitate denim. This was because real denim fabric is not tough enough for automobile use and cannot pass fire resistance safety standards. The copper rivets were the actual versions and the seat design included traditional contrasting stitching with the Levi's tab on both the front seat backs. The option also included unique door panels with Levis trim and removable map pockets, as well as &quot;Levi's&quot; decal identification on the front fenders. The Levi's interior was available through the 1978 [[AMC Concord]].

A Levi's trim package was also made available by AMC on the [[Jeep CJ]] line in 1975. This consisted of demin-like vinyl upholstery and a matching canvas top.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=dR3wmKlfnrMC&amp;pg=PA101&amp;lpg=PA101&amp;dq=AMC+offered+an+optional+Levis+package+in+1975+CJ+denim-like+vinyl+and+matching+canvas+top |pages=101–102 |title=Jeep Color History |first=Steve |last=Statham |publisher=MBI Publishing |year=2002 |isbn=9780760306369 |accessdate=2015-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; This option was available on all CJ models in blue or tan, and was the standard trim on the top-level Renegade versions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=Iem-AwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA104&amp;lpg=PA104&amp;dq=in+blue+and+tan+The+Levi's+trim+was+standard+on+Renegade+and+optional+on+other+CJs |page=104 |title=Jeep: The History of America's Greatest Vehicle |first=Patrick R. |last=Foster |year=2014 |isbn=9781627882187 |publisher=Motorbooks |accessdate=2015-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1973 and 1975 Volkswagen produced the [[Volkswagen Beetle|Jeans Beetle]], which had all-denim trim.  They also repeated this concept in some later models.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.jeansbeetles.com/chronologieenglish.htm |work=Jeansbeetles.com |title=Chronology and Descriptions |accessdate=2015-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, the worldwide denim market equalled [[United States dollar|USD]] 51.6 billion, with demand growing by 5% and supply growing by 8% annually.&lt;ref name=&quot;world denim market report&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.denimsandjeans.com/latest-denim-reports/denim-data-figures/world-denim-market-a-report-on-capacitiesmarket-size-forecasts-etc/ |title=World Denim Market – A Report on Capacities,Market Size, Forecasts etc. |first=Sandeep |last=Agarwal |publisher=Denimsandjeans.com |date=2009-10-13 |accessdate=2015-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over 50% of denim is produced in Asia, most of it in [[China]], [[India]], [[Turkey]], [[Pakistan]], and [[Bangladesh]].

== Denim in Bollywood ==
In Bollywood denim jeans and jackets are a symbol of the middle class and a representation of what is appropriate for modern Indian bodies.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title = Global Denim|last = |first = |publisher = Berg|year = 2010|isbn = 9781847886323|location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Denim jeans can even belong to lavish costume displays that represent the aspirations of Indian people. Wilkinson-Weber (2011) refers to Miller (2007) that initially there were only a few choices and styles of jeans in India compared to those in other countries of the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt; However, Indians from the urban middle and upper class began to find it easier than ever to buy jeans “domestic or imported (often fake) versions from elsewhere in Asia [that] provide a range of price and quality alongside foreign high-priced labels”.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt; What attracts the young Indians to purchase denim is the emulation of celebrities on the screens. Denim in Bollywood signifies bold behavior on the part of characters and a willingness to explore new forms of identity as well as the pursuit of Western values and social mobility.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt; Indeed, many Indian viewers “imaginatively anticipate” their own identities by watching Bollywood films,&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt; and some even hire personal tailors to make jeans so they can fulfil their dreams of imitating favorite film characters.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt;

A '''festival''' is an event ordinarily celebrated by a [[community]] and centering on some characteristic aspect of that community and its [[religion]] or [[tradition]]s, often marked as a local or national [[holiday]], [[mela]] or [[Muslim holidays|eid]]. Next to religion and [[folklore]], a significant origin is [[agriculture|agricultural]]. Food is such a vital resource that many festivals are associated with [[harvest]] time. Religious commemoration and thanksgiving for good harvests are blended in events that take place in [[autumn]], such as [[Halloween]] in the northern hemisphere and [[Easter]] in the southern.

Festivals often serve to fulfill specific communal purposes, especially in regard to commemoration or thanksgiving. The celebrations offer a sense of belonging for religious, social, or geographical groups, contributing to [[group cohesiveness]]. They may also provide [[entertainment]], which was particularly important to local communities before the advent of mass-produced entertainment. Festivals that focus on cultural or ethnic topics also seek to inform community members of their traditions; the involvement of [[old age|elders]] sharing stories and experience provides a means for unity among [[family|families]].

In [[Ancient Greece]] and [[Ancient Rome|Rome]], festivals such as the [[Saturnalia]] were closely associated with social organisation and political processes as well as religion.&lt;ref name=Robertson&gt;{{cite book|last=Robertson|first=Noel|title=Festivals and legends: the formation of Greek cities in the light of public ritual|year=1992|publisher=University of Toronto Press|location=Toronto|isbn=0802059880|edition=Repr.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Brandt&gt;{{cite book|last=Brandt|first=edited by J.

==Etymology==

[[File:Ländliches Fest in Schwaben.jpg|thumb|upright= 1.10|Country Festival in [[Swabia]]]]
The word &quot;festival&quot; was originally used as an adjective from the late fourteenth century, deriving from [[Latin]] via [[Old French]].&lt;ref name=oed1&gt;&quot;[http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/69567 festival, adj. and n.]&quot;. [[OED Online]]. March 2014. Oxford University Press. Accessed April 16, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Middle English]], a &quot;festival dai&quot; was a religious holiday.&lt;ref&gt;[http://quod.lib.umich.edu/cgi/m/mec/med-idx?type=id&amp;id=MED15806&amp;egs=all festival (adj.)] at the [[Middle English Dictionary]]. Accessed April 16, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Its first recorded used as a noun was in 1589 (as &quot;Festifall&quot;).&lt;ref name=oed1/&gt; Feast first came into usage as a noun circa 1200,&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/68799 feast, n.]&quot;. [[OED Online]]. March 2014. Oxford University Press. Accessed April 16, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; and its first recorded use as a verb was circa 1300.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/68800 feast, v.]&quot;. [[OED Online]]. March 2014. Oxford University Press. Accessed April 16, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; The term &quot;feast&quot; is also used in common [[secular]] [[idiom|parlance]] as a synonym for any large or elaborate [[meal]]. When used as in the meaning of a festival, most often refers to a [[religious festival]] rather than a film or art festival. In the [[Philippines]] and many other former Spanish colonies, the Spanish word '''fiesta''' is used to denote a communal religious feast to honor a [[patron saint]].

==Traditions==
Many festivals have religious origins and entwine cultural and religious significance in traditional activities. The most important religious festivals such as [[Christmas]], [[Hanukkah]], [[Diwali]] and [[Eid al-Adha]] serve to mark out the year. Others, such as [[harvest festival]]s, celebrate seasonal change. Events of historical significance, such as important military victories or other nation-building events also provide the impetus for a festival. An early example is the festival established by [[Ancient Egypt]]ian Pharaoh [[Rameses III]] celebrating his victory over the Libyans.&lt;ref name=Berrett&gt;{{cite book|last=Berrett|first=LaMar C.|title=Discovering the world of the Bible|year=1996|publisher=Grandin Book Co.|location=Provo, Utah|isbn=0-910523-52-5|page=289|edition=3rd ed., rev.|author2=Ogden D. Kelly}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In many countries, royal holidays commemorate dynastic events just as agricultural holidays are about harvests. Festivals are often commemorated annually.

There are numerous [[Outline of festivals|types of festivals]] in the world and most countries celebrate important events or traditions with traditional cultural events and activities. Most culminate in the consumption of specially prepared food (showing the connection to &quot;feasting&quot;) and they bring people together. Festivals are also strongly associated with national holidays. Lists of national festivals are published to make participation easier.&lt;ref&gt;See for example: [[List of festivals in Australia]]; [[List of festivals in Bangladesh|Bangladesh]]; [[List of festivals in Canada|Canada]]; [[Traditional Chinese holidays|China]]; [[List of festivals in Colombia|Colombia]]; [[List of festivals in Costa Rica|Costa Rica]]; [[List of festivals in Fiji|Fiji]]; [[Public holidays in India|India]]; [[List of festivals in Indonesia|Indonesia]]; [[List of festivals in Iran|Iran]]; [[List of festivals in Japan|Japan]]; [[List of festivals in Laos|Laos]]; [[List of festivals in Morocco|Morocco]]; [[List of festivals in Nepal|Nepal]]; [[List of festivals in Pakistan|Pakistan]]; [[List of festivals in the Philippines|Philippines]]; [[List of festivals in Romania|Romania]]; [[List of festivals in Tunisia|Tunisia]]; [[List of festivals in Turkey|Turkey]]; [[List of festivals in the United Kingdom|United Kingdom]]; [[List of festivals in the United States|United States]]; [[List of festivals in Vietnam|Vietnam]].

==Types of festivals==

===Religious festivals===
{{main|Religious festival}}
Among many [[religion]]s, a '''feast''' is a set of celebrations in honour of [[God]] or [[Polytheism|gods]].&lt;ref name=Bleeker&gt;Ancient Egyptian festivals could be either religious or political.{{cite book|last=Bleeker|first=C. J.|title=Egyptian festivals. Enactments of religious renewal|date=1967 [1968]|publisher=E. J. Brill|location=Leiden, The Netherlands}}&lt;/ref&gt; A feast and a festival are historically interchangeable. Most religions have festivals that recur annually and some, such as [[Passover]], Easter and Eid al-Adha are [[moveable feast]]s - that is, those that are determined either by lunar or agricultural cycles or the calendar in use at the time. The [[Sed festival]], for example, celebrated the thirtieth year of an Egyptian [[pharaoh]]'s rule and then every three (or four in one case) years after that.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Heb-Sed (Egyptian feast)|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/258986/Heb-Sed|work=[[Encyclopedia Britannica]]|accessdate=16 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Christian]] [[liturgical calendar]] there are two principal feasts, properly known as the Feast of the Nativity of our Lord (Christmas) and the Feast of the Resurrection, (Easter). In the [[Catholic]], [[Eastern Orthodox]], and [[Anglican]] liturgical calendars there are a great number of lesser feasts throughout the year commemorating saints, sacred events or doctrines.

[[Buddhism|Buddhist]] religious festivals, such as [[Esala Perahera]] are held in Sri Lanka and Thailand.&lt;ref name=Gerson&gt;{{cite book|last=Gerson|first=Ruth|title=Traditional festivals in Thailand|year=1996|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Kuala Lumpur; New York|isbn=9676531111}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[List of Sindhi festivals|Hindu festivals]], such as [[Holi]] are very ancient. The [[Sikh]] community celebrates the [[Vaisakhi]] festival marking the new year and birth of the [[Khalsa]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Roy2005&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Roy|first=Christian|title=Traditional Festivals, Vol. 2 &amp;#91;M - Z&amp;#93;: A Multicultural Encyclopedia|year=2005|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-1-57607-089-5|page=480|chapter=Sikh Vaisakhi: Anniversary of the Pure}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Arts festivals===
{{main|Arts festival}}

Among the many offspring of general arts festivals are also more specific types of festivals, including ones that showcase intellectual or creative achievement such as [[science festival]]s, [[literary festival]]s and [[music festival]]s.&lt;ref&gt;See [[List of music festivals]].&lt;/ref&gt;  Sub-categories include [[comedy festival]]s, [[rock festival]]s, [[List of jazz festivals|jazz festivals]] and [[buskers festival]]s; [[poetry]] festivals,&lt;ref&gt;Some such as such as [[Cúirt International Festival of Literature]] started as a poetry festival and then broadened in scope.&lt;/ref&gt; [[theatre festival]]s, and [[storytelling festival]]s; and re-enactment festivals such as [[Renaissance fair]]s.

[[Film festival]]s involve the screenings of several different films, and are usually held annually. Some of the most significant film festivals include the [[Berlin International Film Festival]], the [[Venice Film Festival]] and the [[Cannes Film Festival]].

===Food and drink festivals===
{{main|Food festival}}
A food festival is an event celebrating food or drink. These often highlight the output of producers from a certain region. Some food festivals are focused on a particular item of food, such as the [[National Peanut Festival]] in the United States, or the [[Galway International Oyster Festival]] in Ireland. There are also specific beverage festivals, such as the famous [[Oktoberfest]] in Germany for [[Beer festival|beer]]. Many countries hold festivals to celebrate [[wine festival|wine]]. One example is the global celebration of the arrival of [[Beaujolais nouveau]], which involves shipping the new wine around the world for its release date on the third Thursday of November each year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Hyslop|first=Leah|title=Beaujolais Nouveau day: 10 facts about the wine|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/foodanddrink/wine/10465236/Beaujolais-Nouveau-day-10-facts-about-the-wine.html|newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]|date=21 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Haine2006&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Haine|first=W.

===Seasonal and harvest festivals===

Seasonal festivals, such as [[Beltane]], are determined by the [[solar calendar|solar]] and the [[lunar calendar]]s and by the cycle of the [[season]]s, especially because of its effect on food supply, as a result of which there is a wide range of ancient and modern [[List of harvest festivals|harvest festivals]]. Ancient Egyptians relied upon the seasonal [[inundation]] caused by the [[Nile River]], a form of [[irrigation]], which provided fertile land for crops.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bunson&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Bunson|first=Margaret|title=Encyclopedia of Ancient Egypt|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-6EJ0G-4jyoC&amp;pg=PA277|year=2009|publisher=Infobase Publishing|isbn=978-1-4381-0997-8|page=278|chapter=Nile festivals}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Alps]], in autumn the return of the cattle from the mountain [[pasture]]s to the stables in the valley is celebrated as ''[[Almabtrieb]]''. A recognized winter festival, the [[Chinese New Year]], is set by the lunar calendar, and celebrated from the day of the second new moon after the [[Dongzhi (solar term)|winter solstice]]. [[Dree Festival]] of the Apatanis living in Lower Subansiri District of Arunachal Pradesh is celebrated every year from July 4 to 7 by praying for a bumper crop harvest.&lt;ref name=&quot;GoAP PR&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://arunachalpradesh.nic.in/press/04-05/050704a.htm|title=Press release – Dree festival|date=5 July 2004|publisher=Directorate of Information, Govt of Arunachal Pradesh|accessdate=2009-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Midsummer]] or St John's Day, is an example of a seasonal festival, related to the [[feast day]] of a Christian saint as well as a celebration of the time of the [[summer solstice]] in the northern hemisphere, where it is particularly important in Sweden. [[Winter carnival]]s also provide the opportunity to utilise to celebrate creative or sporting activities requiring snow and ice.

'''Udhagamandalam''' (also '''Ootacamund''' ({{audio|Ootacamund.ogg|listen}})) and abbreviated as '''Udhagai''' and '''Ooty''' ({{audio|Ooty.ogg|listen}}) is a town and [[municipality]] in the Indian state of [[Tamil Nadu]]. It is located 80&amp;nbsp;km north of [[Coimbatore]] and is the capital of [[the Nilgiris district]]. It is a popular [[hill station]] located in the [[Nilgiri Hills]]. 

Originally occupied by the [[Toda people|Toda]]s, the area came under the rule of the [[East India Company]] at the end of the 18th century. The economy is based on tourism and agriculture, along with manufacture of medicines and photographic film. The town is connected by the [[Nilgiri Ghat Roads|Nilgiri ghat roads]] and [[Nilgiri Mountain Railway]]. Its natural beauty attract tourists and is a popular summer destination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tamilnadu.com/destinations/ooty.html |title=Ooty in Tamilnadu|publisher= Tamilnadu.com|date=14 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2011, the town had a population of 88,430.

==Etymology==
The origin of the name Udhagamandalam is obscure. The first mention of the place occurs in a letter of March 1821 to the ''Madras Gazette'' from an unknown correspondent as ''Wotokymund''.&lt;ref name=ooty.net&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.ooty.net/history.html|title = History| access-date = 15 February 2008| publisher = ooty.net}}&lt;/ref&gt; In early times it was called ''OttaikalMandu.'' &quot;Mund&quot; is the [[Tamil language|Tamil]] word for a [[Toda people|Toda]] village, and the first part of the name is probably a corruption of the local name for the central region of the Nilgiri Plateau.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Ootacamund, A History | publisher=Madras Govt. Press | author=Price, Sir Frederick | year=1908 | pages=14–15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another likely origin of the stem of the name (''Ootaca'') comes from the local language in which ''Otha-Cal'' literally means ''Single Stone''. This is perhaps a reference to a sacred stone revered by the local Toda people. The name probably changed under British rule from Udhagamandalam to Ootacamund, and later was shortened to Ooty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
| url = http://www.ooty.ind.in/ooty_history.php|title = Ooty History| access-date = 15 February 2008| publisher = ooty.ind.in}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ooty is situated in the [[Nilgiris|Nilgiri hills]]. The name meaning ''blue mountains'' in [[Tamil language|Tamil]] name might have arisen from the blue smoky haze given off by the [[eucalyptus tree]]s that cover the area or from the [[kurunji]] flower, which blooms every twelve years giving the slopes a bluish tinge.&lt;ref name=ooty.net/&gt; The beautiful mountains and green valleys led to the epithet ''Queen of Hill Stations''.&lt;ref name=Evoire/&gt;

==History==
[[File:Ootacamund Ooty Map 1911.jpg|thumb|left|Ooty in 1911]]
[[File:Ooty Crop.jpg|thumb|Ooty, India (c. 2011)]]

Udhagamandalam was originally a tribal land occupied by the Todas along with other tribes who coexisted through specialization and trade. The major tribes of [[Nilagiri]] area are [[Toda people]], [[Kota people (India)|Kotas]], [[Badagas]] and Alu Kurumbas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last =Thiagarajan | first =Shantha | title = Badaga language not a dialect of Kannada, claims French linguistic scholar| newspaper =The Times of India | date =4 December 2012 | url = http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2012-12-04/coimbatore/35593445_1_badaga-community-nilgiris-language|access-date=4 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Todas in Nilgiris are referenced in a record dated 1117 AD.&lt;ref name=francis/&gt;  Toda people are known for raising water buffaloes and Badaga people for their farming activities.&lt;ref name=Evoire/&gt; Nilgiris was ruled by various [[Tamilakam|Tamil kingdoms]] and [[Hoysala]]s.&lt;ref name=francis&gt;{{cite book |last1=Francis |first1=F |title=The Nilgiris Volume 1 of Madras district gazetteers |url= http://books.google.co.in/books?id=luXS-8vTrJQC&amp;pg=PA113&amp;dq=Ootacamund&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=JHoHUf_OHcLRrQeMyIGoBg&amp;ved=0CGEQ6AEwCA#v=onepage&amp;q=Punisa&amp;f=false|access-date=29 January 2013 |edition= |volume= |year=1908 |publisher=Asian Educational Services |location=New Delhi |isbn=9788120605466 |page=91,92 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tippu Sultan]] captured and extended the border by constructing a hideout cave like structure.&lt;ref name=Evoire&gt;{{cite web|url =http://evoire.com/page/ooty/|title = Ooty History| access-date = 15 February 2008| publisher = evoire.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Nilgiris came into possession of [[British East India Company]] as part of the ceded lands, held by [[Tipu Sultan]], by the treaty of [[Srirangapatnam]] in 1799.

In 1818, Wish and Kindersley, assistants to [[John Sullivan (British governor)|John Sullivan]], then Collector of Coimbatore visited Ooty and submitted a report to him. John Sullivan camped at Dimbhatti, north of [[Kotagiri]] in January 1819 and was enthralled by the beauty of the place. He wrote to Thomas Munro, '' ... it resembles Switzerland, more than any country of Europe... the hills beautifully wooded and fine strong spring with running water in every valley''.&lt;ref name=john/&gt; The Todas handed over that part of the town to Sullivan and in May 1819, Sullivan began the construction of his bungalow at Dimbhatti. He also started work on a road from Sirumugai to Dimbhatti in 1819. The road was completed in May 1823 and the road was extend up to Coonoor by 1830-32.&lt;ref name=ooty.net/&gt; Ooty served as the summer capital of the [[Madras Presidency]] and visited by British during the colonial days as a popular summer resort. Soldiers were sent to nearby [[Wellington, Tamil Nadu|Wellington]] to recuperate. Wellington is the home of the [[Madras Regiment]] of the [[Indian Army]].&lt;ref name=Ootyhist&gt;History of Ootacamund by Sir Frederick Price, Madras Government Press, 1908.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Ootyhist2&gt;Sir Arthur Lawley, Eloquent Knight Errant, D.

==Climate==
Ooty features a [[subtropical highland climate]] (Cwb) under [[Köppen climate classification]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Climate-Data.org&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Climate: Ooty - Climate graph, Temperature graph, Climate table|url=http://en.climate-data.org/location/24046/|publisher=Climate-Data.org|access-date=30 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite its location in the tropics, in stark contrast with most of South India, Ooty generally features pleasantly mild conditions throughout the year.

Temperatures are relatively consistent throughout the year; with average high temperatures ranging from about {{convert|17|-|20|C|F|0}} and average low temperatures between approximately {{convert|5|-|12|C|F|0}}. The highest temperature ever recorded in Ooty was {{convert|25|C}}, which by South Asian standards is uncharacteristically low for an all-time record high temperature.The rainy season in Ooty is generally very cool and windy with high humidity. The windchill may fall to as low as 5&amp;nbsp;°C during the day time. Wind is always high throughout the year.  The lowest temperature was {{convert|-2|C}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://citypatriots.com/asia/india/tamil-nadu/ooty|title=Ooty in Tamil Nadu}}&lt;/ref&gt; The city sees on average about {{convert|1250|mm|in|abbr=on}} of precipitation annually, with a marked drier season from December through March.

'''Hiking''' is the preferred term, in [[Canada]] and the [[United States]], for a long, vigorous walk, usually on [[trails]] ([[footpaths]]), in the countryside, while the word [[walking]] is used for shorter, particularly [[urban area|urban]] walks. On the other hand, in the [[United Kingdom]], and the [[Republic of Ireland]], the term walking is acceptable to describe all forms of walking, whether it is a walk in the park or [[backpacking (wilderness)|backpacking]] in the [[Alps]]. The word hiking is also often used in the UK, along with '''rambling''' (a slightly old-fashioned term), '''[[hillwalking]]''', and '''fell walking''' (a term mostly used for hillwalking in northern England). In [[New Zealand]] a long, vigorous walk or hike is called [[Tramping in New Zealand|'''tramping''']].&lt;ref&gt;H. W. Orsman, ''The Dictionary of New Zealand English''. Auckland: Oxford University Press, 1999. ISBN 0-19-558347-7.&lt;/ref&gt; It is a popular activity with numerous [[:Category:Hiking organizations|hiking organizations]] worldwide, and studies suggest that all forms of walking have health benefits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.miller-mccune.com/health/for-good-health-take-a-hike-3862|title=For Good Health: Take a Hike!|first=John|last=McKinney|work=Miller-McCune|date=2009-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A Step in the Right Direction: The health benefits of hiking and trails|url=http://atfiles.org/files/pdf/AHShealthben.pdf|publisher=American Hiking Society|accessdate=1 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[United States]], [[Canada]], the [[Republic of Ireland]], and [[United Kingdom]], hiking means walking outdoors on a trail, or off trail, for recreational purposes.&lt;ref name=hikebook&gt;{{cite book|title=Hiking|first=Kristin T.|last=Keller|publisher=Capstone Press|year=2007|isbn=0-7368-0916-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; A day hike refers to a hike that can be completed in a single day. However, in the [[United Kingdom]], the word walking is also used, as well as rambling, while walking in mountainous areas is called [[hillwalking]]. In [[Northern England]], Including the [[Lake District]] and [[Yorkshire Dales]], fellwalking describes hill or mountain walks, as [[fell]] is the common word for both features there.

Hiking sometimes involves bushwhacking and is sometimes referred to as such. This specifically refers to difficult walking through dense forest, undergrowth, or bushes, where forward progress requires pushing vegetation aside. In extreme cases of bushwhacking, where the vegetation is so dense that human passage is impeded, a [[machete]] is used to clear a pathway. The Australian term bushwalking refers to both on and off-trail hiking. Common terms for hiking used by [[New Zealand]]ers are [[Tramping in New Zealand|tramping]] (particularly for overnight and longer trips),&lt;ref&gt;H. W. Orsman, ''The Dictionary of New Zealand English''. Auckland: Oxford University Press, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; walking or bushwalking. '''[[Trekking]]''' is the preferred word used to describe multi-day hiking in the mountainous regions of [[India]], [[Pakistan]], [[Nepal]], [[North America]], [[South America]], [[Iran]] and in the highlands of [[East Africa]]. Hiking a [[long-distance trail]] from end-to-end is also referred to as trekking and as [[thru-hiking]] in some places.&lt;ref name=longdist&gt;{{cite book|title=Long-Distance Hiking: Lessons from the Appalachian Trail|first=Roland|last=Mueser|publisher=McGraw-Hill|year=1997|isbn=0-07-044458-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://wayback.archive.org/web/20081227121848/http://www.highplaces.co.uk/treks/country29.html Trekking and Hiking in Persia - Iran]| High Places&lt;/ref&gt; In [[North America]], multi-day hikes, usually with [[camping]], are referred to as [[backpacking (wilderness)|backpacking]].&lt;ref name=hikebook/&gt;

==History==
The idea of taking a walk in the countryside for pleasure developed in the 18th-century, and arose because of changing attitudes to the landscape and nature, associated with the [[Romanticism|Romantic movement]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Norton Anthology of English Literature'', ed. M. H,Abrams, vol.2 (7th edition) (2000), p. 9-10.&lt;/ref&gt; In earlier times walking generally indicated poverty and was also associated with vagrancy.&lt;ref&gt;Rebecca Solnit, ''Wanderlust: A History of Walking''. New York: Penguin Books, 2000, p.83, and note p.297.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Thomas West (clergyman)|Thomas West]], an English [[clergy]]man, popularized the idea of walking for pleasure in his guide to the [[Lake District]] of 1778. In the introduction he wrote that he aimed &lt;blockquote&gt;to encourage the taste of visiting the lakes by furnishing the traveller with a Guide; and for that purpose, the writer has here collected and laid before him, all the select stations and points of view, noticed by those authors who have last made the tour of the lakes, verified by his own repeated observations.&lt;ref name=West2&gt;{{cite book |last=West |title=A Guide to the Lakes |page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; To this end he included various 'stations' or viewpoints around the lakes, from which tourists would be encouraged to enjoy the views in terms of their aesthetic qualities.&lt;ref name=development&gt;{{cite web |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081011064752/http://www.lakedistrict.uk7.net/tourist_development.html |title=Development of tourism in the Lake District National Park|accessdate=2008-11-27|publisher=Lake District UK }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Published in 1778 the book was a major success.&lt;ref name=NPA&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lakedistrict.gov.uk/learning/lakedistrictfacts/archaeologyhistory/archaeologydiscoveryzone/archaeologyindepth/archaeologyviewing-stations-2 |title=Understanding the National Park &amp;mdash; Viewing Stations|accessdate=2008-11-27|publisher=Lake District National Park Authority }}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
[[File:Travels-map.jpg|left|thumb|180x180px|Map of [[Robert Louis Stevenson]]'s walking route, taken from ''[[Travels with a Donkey in the Cévennes]]''(1879), a pioneering classic of [[outdoor literature]].]]

Another famous early exponent of walking for pleasure, was the English poet [[William Wordsworth]]. In 1790 he embarked on an extended tour of France, Switzerland, and Germany, a journey subsequently recorded in his long autobiographical poem ''[[The Prelude]]'' (1850). His famous poem ''[[Tintern Abbey (poem)|Tintern Abbey]]'' was inspired by a visit to the [[Wye Valley]] made during a [[walking tour]] of [[Wales]] in 1798 with his sister [[Dorothy Wordsworth]]. Wordsworth's friend [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge|Coleridge]] was another keen walker and in the autumn of 1799, he and Wordsworth undertook a three weeks tour of the [[Lake District]]. [[John Keats]], who belonged to the next generation of [[Romantic poets]] began, in June 1818, a [[walking tour]] of Scotland, Ireland, and the [[Lake District]] with his friend Charles Armitage Brown.

More and more people undertook walking tours through the 19th-century, of which the most famous is probably [[Robert Louis Stevenson]]'s journey through the [[Cévennes]] in France with a donkey, recorded in his ''[[Travels with a Donkey]]'' (1879). Stevenson also published in 1876 his famous essay &quot;Walking Tours&quot;. The subgenre of [[travel writing]] produced many classics in the subsequent 20th-century. An early American example of a book that describes an extended walking tour is naturalist [[John Muir]]'s ''A Thousand Mile Walk to the Gulf'' (1916), a posthumous published account of a long botanizing walk, undertaken in 1867.

Due to [[Industrial Revolution|industrialisation]] in [[England]], people began to migrate to the cities where living standards were often cramped and unsanitary. They would escape the confines of the city by rambling about in the countryside. However, the land in England, particularly around the urban areas of [[Manchester]] and [[Sheffield]], was privately owned and [[trespass]] was illegal. Rambling clubs soon sprang up in the [[North of England|north]] and began politically campaigning for the legal '[[right to roam]]'. One of the first such clubs, was 'Sunday Tramps' founded by Leslie White in 1879. The first national grouping, the Federation of Rambling Clubs, was formed in [[London]] in 1905 and was heavily patronized by the [[peerage]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SBkNAQAAIAAJ&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s|title=Forbidden Land: The Struggle for Access to Mountain and Moorland|author=Stephenson, Tom|year=1989|publisher= Manchester University Press|page=78|accessdate=2013-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Access to Mountains [[bill (proposed law)|bill]]s, that would have legislated the public's 'right to roam' across some private land, were periodically presented to [[Parliament]] from 1884 to 1932 without success. Finally, in 1932, the Rambler’s Right Movement organized a [[Mass trespass of Kinder Scout|mass trespass]] on [[Kinder Scout]] in [[Derbyshire]]. Despite attempts on the part of the [[police]] to prevent the trespass from going ahead it was successfully achieved due to massive publicity. However the Mountain Access Bill that was passed in 1939 was opposed by many walkers, including the organization [[The Ramblers]], who felt that it did not sufficiently protect their rights, and it was eventually repealed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ramblers.org.uk/wales/what-we-do/protecting-and-expanding-where-we-walk/right-to-roam-crow.aspx The Ramblers]&lt;/ref&gt;

The effort to improve access led after World War II to the [[National Parks and Access to the Countryside Act 1949]], and in 1951 to the creation of the first [[national park]] in the UK, the [[Peak District National Park]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.peakdistrict.gov.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0009/79227/factsheet4-quarrying.pdf |title=Quarrying and mineral extraction in the Peak District National Park |publisher=Peak District National Park Authority |year=2011 |accessdate=17 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The establishment of this and similar national parks helped to improve access for all outdoors enthusiasts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nowthenmagazine.com/issue-52/kinder-trespass/|title=Kinder Trespass. A history of rambling |accessdate=2013-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000]] considerably extended the [[right to roam]] in England and Wales.

===United States===
[[File:Abbey and the mountain.JPG|thumb|[[Thoreau]] walked {{convert|34|mi|km}} to [[Mount Wachusett]], shown here.]]

An early example of an interest in hiking in the United States, is Abel Crawford and his son Ethan's clearing of a trail to the summit of [[Mount Washington, New Hampshire]] in 1819.&lt;ref&gt;Condensed Facts About Mount Washington, Atkinson News Co., 1912.&lt;/ref&gt; This 8.5 mile path is the oldest continually used hiking trail in the United States. The influence of British and European [[Romanticism]] reached North America through the [[transcendentalist movement]], and both [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]] (1803–82) and [[Henry David Thoreau]] (1817-62) were important influences on the outdoors movement in North America. Thoreau's writing on nature and on walking include the posthumously published &quot;Walking&quot; (1862). While an earlier essay  &quot;[[A Walk to Wachusett]]&quot; (1842) describes a four-day [[walking tour]] he took with a companion from Concord, Massachusetts to the summit of [[Mount Wachusett]], [[Princeton, Massachusetts]] and back. In 1876 the [[Appalachian Mountain Club]], America’s earliest recreation organization, was founded to protect the trails and mountains in the northeastern United States.

The Scottish-born, American naturalist [[John Muir]] (1838 –1914), was another important early advocate of the preservation of [[wilderness]] in the United States. He petitioned the [[U.S. Congress]] for the National Park bill that was passed in 1890, establishing Yosemite and Sequoia National Parks. The [[Sierra Club]], which he founded, is now one of the most important conservation organizations in the United States. The spiritual quality and enthusiasm toward nature expressed in his writings inspired others, including presidents and congressmen, to take action to help preserve large areas of undeveloped countryside.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sierraclub.org/john_muir_exhibit/life/|title=The Life and Contributions of John Muir |publisher=Sierra Club|accessdate=October 23, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is today referred to as the &quot;Father of the National Parks&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Miller|first=Barbara Kiely|title=John Muir|publisher=Gareth Stevens|year=2008|page=10|isbn=0836883187}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1916, the National Park Service was created to protect national parks and monuments.

In 1921, [[Benton MacKaye]], a forester, conceived the idea of the America's first National trail, the [[Appalachian trail]], and this was completed in August 1937, running from [[Sugarloaf Mountain (Franklin County, Maine)|Sugarloaf Mountain]] in Maine to [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.appalachiantrail.org/about-the-trail/history Appalachian Trail Conservancy]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Pacific Crest Trail]] (&quot;PCT&quot;) was first explored in the 1930s by the [[YMCA]] hiking groups and was eventually registered as a complete border to border trail from Mexico to Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.e2e.com/featured/the-top-10-hiking-trails-in-the-us/|title=The Top 10 Hiking Trails in the US |publisher=e2e.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Long distance hiking ===
[[File:AT - Franconia Ridge.JPG|thumb|left|The Appalachian Trail provides the opportunity for a {{convert|3500|km|mi|adj=mid}}-long hike.&lt;ref name=OFAQ&gt;{{cite web|last=Gailey|first=Chris|year=2006|url=http://www.outdoors.org/conservation/trails/at/at-faq.cfm|title=Appalachian Trail FAQs|work=Outdoors.org|accessdate=2010-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Frequently nowadays long distance hikes (walking tours) are undertaken along [[long distance path]]s, including the [[National Trails]] in [[England and Wales]], the [[National Trail System]] in the [[USA]] and The [[Grande Randonnée]] (France), Grote Routepaden, or Lange-afstand-wandelpaden (Holland), Grande Rota (Portugal), Gran Recorrido (Spain) is a network of [[long-distance footpaths]] in [[Europe]], mostly in [[France]], [[Belgium]], the [[Netherlands]] and [[Spain]]. There are extensive networks in other European countries of long distance trails, as well as in [[Canada]], [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]], [[Nepal]], and to a lesser extent other Asiatic countries, like [[Turkey]], [[Israel]], and [[Jordan]]. In the [[Alps]] of [[Austria]], [[Slovenia]], [[Switzerland]], [[Germany]], [[France]], and [[Italy]] walking tours are often made from 'hut-to-hut', using an extensive system of [[mountain hut]]s.

In the late 20th-century there has been a proliferation of official and unofficial long distance routes, which mean that hikers now are more likely to refer to using a long distance way (Britain), [[trail]] (USA), ''The Grande Randonnée'' (France), etc., than setting out on a walking tour. Early examples of long distance paths, include the [[Appalachian Trail]] in the USA and the [[Pennine Way]] in Britain. Pilgrimage routes are now treated, by some walkers, as long distance routes, and the route taken by the British [[National Trail]] the [[North Downs Way]] closely follows that of the [[Pilgrims' Way]] to [[Canterbury]].

Hiking times can be estimated by [[Naismith's rule]] or [[Tobler's hiking function]].

==Equipment==
{{main|Hiking equipment}}
[[File:Kompas Sofia.JPG|thumb|right|A simple dry magnetic pocket compass]]

The equipment required for hiking depends on the length of the hike, but day hikers generally carry at least water, food, a map, and rain-proof gear.&lt;ref name=hikebook/&gt; Hikers usually wear sturdy [[hiking boots]] for mountain walking and backpacking, as protection from the rough terrain, as well as providing increased stability.&lt;ref name=hikebook/&gt; [[The Mountaineers (club)|The Mountaineers]] club recommends a list of &quot;[[Ten Essentials]]&quot; equipment for hiking, including a [[compass]], sunglasses, [[sunscreen]], a [[flashlight]], a [[first aid kit]], a [[Making fire|fire starter]], and a [[knife]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Mountaineering: The Freedom of the Hills|edition=6th|publisher=The Mountaineers|pages=35–40|year=1997|isbn=0-89886-427-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other groups recommend items such as hat, gloves, [[insect repellent]], and an [[space blanket|emergency blanket]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://texas.sierraclub.org/dallas/page.asp?10essentialgroups|title=Ten Essential Groups Article|publisher=Texas Sierra Club|accessdate=2011-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[GPS navigation device]] can also be helpful and [[route card]]s may be used as a guide.

Proponents of [[ultralight backpacking]] argue that long lists of required items for multi-day hikes increases pack weight, and hence fatigue and the chance of injury.&lt;ref name=Jardine&gt;{{cite web|title=Beyond Backpacking: Ray Jardine's Guide to Lightweight Hiking|first=Ray|last=Jardine|publisher=AdventureLore Press|year=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, they recommend reducing pack weight, in order to make hiking long distances easier. Even the use of hiking boots on long-distances hikes is controversial among ultralight hikers, because of their weight.&lt;ref name=Jardine/&gt;

== Environmental impact ==

[[File:Mohonk Mountain House 2011 Hiking Trail against Guest Rooms 2 FRD 3281.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Parts of many hiking trails around [[Lake Mohonk]], New York State, USA include stairways which can prevent erosion]]

[[Natural environment]]s are often fragile, and may be accidentally damaged, especially when a large number of hikers are involved. For example, years of gathering wood can strip an alpine area of valuable nutrients, and can cause deforestation.&lt;ref name=impact&gt;{{cite journal
| last = Cole   | first = David   | authorlink =    | title = Impacts of Hiking and Camping on Soils and Vegetation: A Review   | journal =    | volume =    | issue =    | pages =    | publisher =    | location =    | url = http://leopold.wilderness.net/research/fprojects/docs12/Ecotourism.pdf  | issn =    | doi =    | id =    | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt; and some species, such as [[marten]]s or [[Bighorn Sheep|bighorn sheep]], are very sensitive to the presence of humans, especially around mating season. Generally, protected areas such as parks have regulations in place to protect the environment, so as to minimize such impact.&lt;ref name=impact /&gt; Such regulations include banning wood fires, restricting [[camping]] to established camp sites, disposing or packing out [[Human feces|faecal matter]], and imposing a quota on the number of hikers. Many hikers espouse the philosophy of [[Leave No Trace]], following strict practices on dealing with food waste, food packaging, and other impact on the environment.&lt;ref name=lnt&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lnt.org/programs/principles.hp|title=Principles|work=Leave No Trace|accessdate=2011-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[Image:Cathole.png|thumb|right|100px|A cathole for human waste]]

Human waste is often a major source of environmental impact from hiking,&lt;ref name=impact/&gt; and can contaminate the watershed and make other hikers ill. '[[Cathole]]s' dug 10 to 25&amp;nbsp;cm (4 to 10&amp;nbsp;inches) deep, depending on local soil composition and covered after use, at least 60 m (200&amp;nbsp;feet) away from water sources and trails, are recommended to reduce the risk of [[bacteria]]l contamination.

Fire is a particular source of danger and an individual hiker can have a large impact on an ecosystem. For example, in 2005, a [[Czechs|Czech]] backpacker burned 7% of [[Torres del Paine National Park]] in [[Chile]] by knocking over a [[portable stove]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/travel/article-593108/Chilean-park-recovering-fire.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110211180442/http://www.dailymail.co.uk/travel/article-593108/Chilean-park-recovering-fire.html|archivedate=2011-02-11|title=Chilean park recovering from fire|newspaper=Daily Mail|date=2005-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Etiquette ==
Sometimes the action of hikers may come into conflict with other users of the land. Hiking [[etiquette]] has developed to minimize such interference. Common hiking etiquette includes:
* When two groups of hikers meet on a steep trail,  a custom has developed in some areas whereby the group moving uphill has the [[Priority (right of way)|right-of-way]].&lt;ref name=etiquette&gt;{{cite web|title=Trail Etiquette|first=Melissa|last=Devaughn|work=Backpacker Magazine|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cd4DAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA40|accessdate=22 January 2011|date=April 1997|publisher=Active Interest Media, Inc.|page=40|issn=0277-867X}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Being forced to hike much faster than one's natural pace can be annoying, difficult to maintain consistently, and increases [[Fatigue (physical)|fatigue]]; it may also cause injury. But if a group splits between fast and slow hikers, the slow hikers may be left behind or become lost. Therefore, a common custom is to encourage the slowest hiker to lead and have everyone match that speed. Another custom is to have experienced hiker(s) sweep up the rear on a rota, to ensure that everyone in the group is safe.
* Hikers generally avoid making loud sounds, such as shouting or loud conversation, or the use of [[mobile phone]]s.&lt;ref name=etiquette/&gt; or music.  However, in bear country, hikers make noise as a safety precaution through the use of whistles or bells.
* Hikers tend to avoid impacting on the land through which they travel. Hikers can avoid impact by staying on established [[trail]]s, not picking plants, or disturbing wildlife, and carrying garbage out. The [[Leave No Trace]] movement offers a set of guidelines for low-impact hiking: &quot;Leave nothing but footprints. Take nothing but photos. Kill nothing but time. Keep nothing but memories&quot;.
* The feeding of wild animals is dangerous and can cause harm to both the animals and to other people.

==Hazards==
{{Main|Hazards of outdoor recreation}}
[[File:Human-wildlife conflict.jpg|thumb|right|Animals may attack humans who disturb them]]
As discussed in [[Hazards of outdoor recreation]], hiking may produce threats to personal safety, from such causes as hazardous terrain, inclement weather, becoming lost, or exacerbation of pre-existing medical conditions. These dangerous circumstances and/or specific accidents or ailments that hikers face may include, for example, [[diarrhea]], for example, one of the most common illnesses afflicting long-distance hikers in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/S0002-9343(02)01494-8|last=Boulware|first=D.R.|year=2003|title=Medical Risks of Wilderness Hiking|journal=American Journal of Medicine|volume=114|issue=4|pages=288–93|pmid=12681456|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; (See [[Wilderness acquired diarrhea]].)

Additional potential hazards involving physical ailments may include [[dehydration]], [[frostbite]], [[hypothermia]], [[sunburn]], or [[sunstroke]], or such injuries as [[ankle]] [[sprain]]s, or broken bones.&lt;ref name=Goldenberg&gt;{{cite book|title=Hiking and Backpacking| page=104| first1=Marni| last1=Goldenberg| first2=Bruce| last2=Martin |publisher=Wilderness Education Association| year=2007| isbn=0-7360-6801-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other threats may be posed attacks by animals (such as mammals (e.g., bears), reptiles (e.g., snakes), or insects) or contact with noxious plants that can cause rashes (e.g., [[poison ivy]], [[poison oak]], [[poison sumac]], or [[stinging nettles]]). Attacks by humans are also a reality in some places, and lightning is also a threat, especially on high ground.

The crossing of [[glacier]]s is potentially hazardous because of the potential for [[crevasse]]s. These giant cracks in the ice are not always visible as snow can be blown and freeze over the top to make a [[snowbridge]]. To cross a glacier the use of a rope, [[crampons]] and [[ice axe]]s are usually required. Deep, fast flowing rivers pose another danger that can be mitigated with ropes.

In various countries, borders may be poorly marked. In 2009, [[Iran]] imprisoned three Americans for hiking across the Iran-[[Iraq]] border.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Iran Seized U.S. Hikers in Iraq, U.S. Report Asserts|newspaper=New York Times|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/23/world/middleeast/23hikers.html?_r=1|date=2010-10-23|first1=Michael R.|last1=Gordon|first2=Andrew W.|last2=Lehren}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is illegal to cross into the USA on the [[Pacific Crest Trail]] from Canada. Going south to north it is more straightforward and a crossing can be made, if advanced arrangements are made with Canadian Border Services. Within the [[Schengen Area]], which includes most of the [[E.U.]], and associated nations like Switzerland and Norway, there are no impediments to crossing by path, and borders are not always obvious.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.via-alpina.org/en/page/771/questions-answers#And_what_else_should_I_know_about_walking_in_the_Alps_ See for example]&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''T-shirt''' (or '''tee shirt''', or '''tee''') is a style of fabric [[shirt]], named after the T shape of the body and sleeves. It is normally associated with short sleeves, a round neck line known as a ''[[crew neck]]'', with no collar.

Typically made of cotton fibers knitted in a [[Jersey (fabric)|jersey stitch]], they have a distinctive soft texture compared to woven shirts. The majority of modern versions have a body made from a continuously woven tube, on a [[Loom#Circular looms|circular loom]], so that the torso has no side seams. The manufacture of T-shirts has become highly automated, and may include fabric cutting by [[Laser cutting|laser]] or [[Water jet cutter|water jet]].

The T-shirt evolved from [[undergarment]]s used in the 19th century, through cutting the one-piece ''[[union suit]]'' underwear into separate top and bottom garments, with the top long enough to tuck under the waistband of the bottoms. With and without buttons, they were adopted by [[miners]] and [[stevedores]] during the late 19th century as a convenient covering for hot environments.

As slip-on garments without buttons, they originally became popular in the United States when they were issued by the U.S. Navy during or following the [[Spanish–American War]] of 1898. These were a crew-necked, short-sleeved, white cotton undershirt to be worn under a uniform. It became common for sailors and Marines in work parties, the early submarines, and tropical climates to remove their uniform ''jacket'', wearing (and soiling) only the undershirt.&lt;ref name=Harris&gt;Harris, Alice. ''The White T''. HarperCollins, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;

They soon became popular as a bottom layer of clothing for workers in various industries, including agriculture. The T-shirt was easily fitted, easily cleaned, and inexpensive, and for those reasons it became the shirt of choice for young boys. Boys' shirts were made in various colors and patterns. By the [[Great Depression]], the T-shirt was often the default garment to be worn when doing farm or ranch chores, as well as other times when modesty called for a torso covering but conditions called for lightweight fabrics.&lt;ref name=Harris /&gt;

A V-neck T-shirt has a V-shaped neckline, as opposed to the round neckline of the more common crew neck shirt. V-necks were introduced so that the neckline of the shirt does not stand out when an outer shirt is worn over it, thus reducing or eliminating the visible cloth above the outer shirt of a crew neck shirt.

== History ==
T-shirts, made of a light, inexpensive fabric, were easy to clean. The earliest T-shirt dates back to sometime between the [[Spanish–American War]] and 1913, when the U.S. Navy began issuing them as undergarments.&lt;ref name=&quot;tshirtspotlight.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tshirtspotlight.com/history-of-the-t-Shirt/|title=History of the T-shirt.|work=Tee Fetch}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The word ''T-shirt'' became part of American English by the 1920s, and appeared in the ''Merriam-Webster Dictionary''.&lt;ref name=&quot;tshirtspotlight.com&quot; /&gt; Following [[World War II]], it became common to see veterans wearing their uniform trousers with their T-shirts as casual clothing. The shirts became even more popular in the 1950s after [[Marlon Brando]] wore one in ''[[A Streetcar Named Desire (1951 film)|A Streetcar Named Desire]]'', finally achieving status as fashionable, stand-alone, outerwear garments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.filmsite.org/stre.html |title=A Streetcar Named Desire – AMC filmsite |publisher=Filmsite.org |date=1947-12-03 |accessdate=2010-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Often boys wore them while doing chores and playing outside, eventually opening up the idea of wearing them as general-purpose casual clothing.

Printed T-shirts were in limited use by 1942 when an Air Corps Gunnery School T-shirt appeared on the cover of ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' magazine.  In the 1960s, printed T-shirts gained popularity for self-expression as well for advertisements, protests, and souvenirs.&lt;ref name=&quot;tshirtspotlight.com&quot; /&gt;

Current versions are available in many different designs and fabrics, and styles include crew-neck and V-neck shirts.

== Trends ==
[[File:TShirtWhereIsFema.jpg|thumb|upright|A T-shirt with a [[protest art]] message on it in the mid-2000s]]

T-shirts were originally worn as undershirts, but are now worn frequently as the only piece of [[clothing]] on the top half of the body, other than possibly a [[brassiere]] or, rarely, an undershirt ([[vest]]). T-shirts have also become a medium for self-expression and advertising, with any imaginable combination of words, art and photographs on display.&lt;ref name=&quot;Neeli Cherkovski 1993&quot;&gt;[[Sally Larsen]] with Neeli Cherkovski, ''Japlish'', Pomegranate Art Books, San Francisco, 1993, ISBN 1-56640-454-1&lt;/ref&gt;

A T-shirt typically extends to the waist. Variants of the T-shirt, such as the V-neck, have been developed. [[Hip hop fashion]] calls for ''tall-T'' shirts which may extend down to the knees. Long T-shirts are also sometimes worn by women as nightgowns.  A 1990s trend in women's clothing involved tight-fitting ''[[crop top|cropped]]'' T-shirt or crop tops short enough to reveal the [[midriff]]. Another less popular trend is wearing a short-sleeved T-shirt of a contrasting color over a long-sleeved T-shirt, which is known as ''layering''. T-shirts that are tight to the body are called ''fitted'', ''tailored'' or ''baby doll'' T-shirts.

== Decoration ==
[[File:Sure, I'm Taiwanese T-shirt.JPG|thumb|upright|A girl wearing a yellow T-shirt]]

One of the earliest examples of T-shirts with a logo or decoration can be found in the 1939 film ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]]''. Three men attending to the Scarecrow at the Wash &amp; Brushup Company in Emerald City are seen wearing green T-shirts with the word &quot;Oz&quot; printed on the fronts.

In the early 1950s, several companies based in [[Miami, Florida]], started to decorate T-shirts with different resort names and various characters. The first company was Tropix Togs, under founder Sam Kantor, in Miami. They were the original licensee for Walt Disney characters in 1976 including Mickey Mouse and Davy Crockett. Later, other companies expanded into the [[Textile printing|T-shirt printing]] business, including Sherry Manufacturing Company, also based in Miami. Sherry, started in 1948 by its owner and founder Quinton Sandler as a screen print scarf business, evolved into one of the largest screen printed resort and licensed apparel companies in the [[United States]].

In the 1960s, the [[ringer T-shirt]] appeared and became a staple fashion for youth and rock-n-rollers. The decade also saw the emergence of [[tie-dye]]ing and [[screen-printing]] on the basic T-shirt and the T-shirt became a medium for wearable art, commercial [[advertising]], [[souvenir]] messages, and [[protest art]] messages.  Psychedelic art poster designer [[Warren Dayton]] pioneered several political, protest, and pop-culture art printed large and in color on T-shirts featuring images of Cesar Chavez, political cartoons, and other cultural icons in an article in the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' magazine in late 1969 (ironically, the clothing company quickly cancelled the experimental line, fearing there would not be a market). In the late 1960s, Richard Ellman, Robert Tree, Bill Kelly, and [[Stanley Mouse]] set up the Monster Company in Mill Valley, California, to produce fine art designs expressly for T-shirts. Monster T-shirts often feature emblems and motifs associated with the [[Grateful Dead]] and [[marijuana]] culture.&lt;ref&gt;''Monster T-shirt ART'', Monster Corporation catalog #3, Mill Valley 1974&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, one of the most popular symbols to emerge from the political turmoil of the 1960s were T-shirts bearing the face of [[Marxist]] revolutionary [[Che Guevara]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sojones.com/news/1465-the-most-famous-statement-T-shirts/ The Most Famous Statement T-shirts] by SoJones Asmara, September 10, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, many notable and memorable T-shirts produced in the 1970s have become ensconced in pop culture. Examples include the bright yellow [[Harvey Ball|happy face]] T-shirts, [[The Rolling Stones]] tops with their &quot;tongue and lips&quot;&lt;ref&gt;File:The Rolling Stones Tongue Logo.png&lt;/ref&gt; logo, and [[Milton Glaser]]'s iconic &quot;[[I Love New York|I ♥ N Y]]” design. In the mid-1980s, the white T-shirt became fashionable after the actor [[Don Johnson]] wore it with an Armani suit in ''[[Miami Vice]]''.&lt;ref name=Harris /&gt;

== Screen printing ==

The most common form of commercial T-shirt decoration is [[screen-printing]]. In screen-printing, a design is separated into individual colors. [[Plastisol]] or water based [[ink]]s are applied to the shirt through mesh screens which limits the areas where ink is deposited. In most commercial T-shirt printing, the specific colors in the design are used. To achieve a wider color spectrum with a limited number of colors, process printing (using only [[CMYK|cyan, magenta, yellow and black]] ink) or simulated process (using only white, black, red, green, blue, and gold ink) is effective. Process printing is best suited for light colored shirts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CMYK Printing|url=http://www.impressionzprinting.com/services/color-printing/|publisher=ImpressionzPrinting.com|author=Steve Rhodes|quote=CMYK is a widely used technique to replicate full-color images on light colored backgrounds.  The full-color process originated to accurately reproduce artwork on white paper.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Simulated process is best suited for dark colored shirts.

In 1959, the invention of [[plastisol]] provided an ink more durable and stretchable than water-based ink, allowing much more variety in T-shirt designs. Very few companies continue to use water-based inks on their shirts. The majority of companies that create shirts prefer plastisol due to the ability to print on varying colors without the need for color adjustment at the art level.

Specialty inks trend in and out of fashion and include [[Screen printing#Screen printing materials|shimmer]], [[Screen printing#Screen printing materials|puff]], [[Screen printing#Screen printing materials|discharge]], and chino based&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Re: chino ink??|url=http://forums.screenprinters.net/viewthread/2/405410|publisher=ScreenPrinters.Net|accessdate=12 December 2013|author=CALIBRATED ''[user-ID]''|quote=Chino is a special Rutland INK BASE mixing system.… While on the surface it looks similar to a reduced base, it does have a unique print quality to it that offers a waterbase feel, without the hassles of waterbase inks.}}&lt;/ref&gt; inks. A metallic foil can be heat pressed and stamped onto any plastisol ink. When combined with shimmer ink, metallics give a mirror like effect wherever the previously screened plastisol ink was applied. Specialty inks are more expensive to purchase as well as screen and tend to appear on garments in boutiques.

Other methods of decoration used on T-shirts include [[airbrush]], [[applique]], [[embroidery]], impressing or embossing, and the [[ironing]] on of either [[Flocking (texture)|flock]] lettering, [[Iron-on#Iron-on transfers|heat transfers]], or [[dye-sublimation]] transfers. [[Laser printer]]s are capable of printing on plain paper using a special [[toner]] containing sublimation dyes which can then be permanently heat-transferred to T-shirts.

In the 1980s, [[thermochromatic]] dyes were used to produce T-shirts that changed color when subjected to heat. The [[Hypercolor|Global Hypercolour]] brand of these was a common sight on the streets of the [[United Kingdom|UK]] for a few years, but has since mostly disappeared. These were also very popular in the United States among teenagers in the late 1980s. A downside of color-change garments is that the dyes can easily be damaged, especially by [[laundry|washing]] in warm water, or dye other clothes during washing.

== Tie dye ==
[[File:TieDyeShirtMpegMan.jpg|thumb|An example of a [[tie-dye]]d T-shirt]]

Tie dye originated in India, Japan, Jamaica, and Africa as early as the sixth century.&lt;ref name=&quot;iml.jou.ufl.edu&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://iml.jou.ufl.edu/projects/Spring09/blake_e/history.html|title=Peace, Love and Tie-Dye|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some forms of tie dye are [[Bandhani]] (the oldest known technique) used in Indian cultures, and [[Shibori]] primarily used in Japanese cultures. It was not until the 1960s that tie dye was introduced to America during the [[hippie movement]], a time when the Vietnam War was being heavily protested.&lt;ref name=&quot;iml.jou.ufl.edu&quot; /&gt;

== Heat transfer vinyl ==
Another form of T-shirt decoration is heat transfer vinyls. These allow people to make short runs of printed shirts using plotter cut vinyl that they can then heat press onto the garment. They are made in a multitude of colors, patterns, and styles, and some even replicate the look of screen print, like ThermoFlex.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}

== Other methods ==
Before the hippie movement [[Rit Dye]] was known as a hobby for older women. Other methods of decorating shirts include using paints, markers, fabric transfer crayons, dyes, spray paint, and many more. Some techniques that can be used include sponging, [[stenciling]], [[wikt:daub#Verb|daubing]], [[wikt:stamping|stamping]], [[screen printing]], bleaching, and many more.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, Carol. The Great T-Shirt Book!: Make Your Own Spectacular, One-of-a-kind Designs. New York: Sterling Pub., 1992. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Dye-sublimation printing ==
[[File:Cat Shirts thatshirtwascash.jpg|thumb|Thatshirtwascash cat shirts using all-over print sublimation]]
Dye-sublimation printing is a direct-to-garment digital printing technology using full color artwork to transfer images to polyester and polymer-coated substrate based T-shirts. Dye-sublimation (also commonly referred to as all-over printing) came into widespread use in the 21st century, enabling some designs previously impossible. Printing with unlimited colors using large CMYK printers with special paper and ink is possible, unlike screen printing which requires screens for each color of the design. All-over print T-shirts have solved the problem with color fading and the vibrancy is higher than most standard printing methods, but requires synthetic fabrics for the ink to take hold. The key feature of dye-sublimated clothing is that the design is not printed on top of the garment, but permanently dyed into the threads of the shirt, ensuring that it will never fade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = About Us and FAQs (read dis) – Shirtwascash|url = http://thatshirtwascash.com/pages/about-us|website = Shirtwascash|accessdate = 2015-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dye-sublimation is economically viable for small-quantity printing; the unit cost is similar for short or long production runs. Screen printing has higher setup costs, requiring large numbers to be produced to be cost-effective, and the unit cost is higher.{{Citation needed|date=January 2016}}

Solid ink [[Phase transition|is changed into a gas]] without passing through a [[liquid]] phase ([[Sublimation (phase transition)|sublimation]]), using heat and pressure. The design is first produced in a computer [[image file format]] such as jpg, gif, png, or any other. It is printed on a purpose-made [[computer printer]] ({{As of|2016|lc=y}} most commonly Epson or Ricoh brands) using large heat presses to vaporize the ink directly into the fabric. By mid-2012 this method had become widely used for T-shirts.

== Expressive messages ==
[[File:I'm not a tomboy — I'm just better than you.jpg|thumb|A [[Nike, Inc.]] T-shirt with the description: I'm not a [[tomboy]] — I'm just better than you.]]

Since the 1980s, T-shirts have flourished as a form of personal [[Emotional expression|expression]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Neeli Cherkovski 1993&quot; /&gt; [[Screen printed]] T-shirts have been a standard form of [[marketing]] for major consumer products, such as [[Coca-Cola]] and [[Mickey Mouse]], since the 1970s. However, since the 1990s, it has become common practice for companies of all sizes to produce T-shirts with their corporate logos or messages as part of their overall [[advertising]] campaigns. Since the late 1980s and especially the 1990s, T-shirts with prominent designer-name logos have become popular, especially with teenagers and young adults. These garments allow consumers to flaunt their taste for designer brands in an inexpensive way, in addition to being decorative. Examples of designer T-shirt branding include [[Calvin Klein]], [[FUBU]], [[Ralph Lauren]], [[American Apparel]], and [[The Gap (clothing retailer)|The Gap]]. &lt;!-- Hi! Don't add a link to your T-shirt shop here either. --&gt; These examples also include representations of rock bands, among other obscure pop-culture references. Licensed T-shirts are also extremely popular. Movie and TV T-shirts can have images of the actors, logos, and funny quotations from the movie or TV show. Often, the most popular T-shirts are those that characters wore in the film itself (e.g., Bubba Gump from ''[[Forrest Gump]]'' and Vote For Pedro from ''[[Napoleon Dynamite]]'').
Designer [[Katharine Hamnett]], in the early 1980s, pioneered outsize T-shirts with large-print slogans. The early first decade of the 21st century saw the renewed popularity of T-shirts with slogans and designs with a strong inclination to the humorous and/or [[media:Ironymens 01.jpg|ironic]]. The trend has only increased later in this decade, embraced by celebrities, such as [[Britney Spears]] and [[Paris Hilton]], and reflected back on them, too ('Team Aniston'). The political and social statements that T-shirts often display have become, since the first decade of the 21st century, one of the reasons that they have so deeply permeated different levels of culture and society. The statements also may be found to be offensive, shocking, or pornographic to some. Many different organizations have caught on to the statement-making trend, including chain and independent stores, websites, and schools.
A popular phrase on the front of T-shirts demonstrating the popularity of T-shirts among tourists is the humorous phrase &quot;I did _____ and all I got was this lousy T-shirt.&quot;  Examples include &quot;My parents went to Las Vegas and all I got was this lousy T-shirt.&quot;
T-shirt exchange is an activity where people trade the T-shirts that they are wearing.

Artists like [[Bill Beckley]], Glen Baldridge and [[Peter Klashorst]] use T-shirts in their work. Models such as [[Victoria Beckham]] and [[Gisele Bundchen]] wore T-shirts through the 2000s. Paris Fashion Week 2104 featured a grunge style T-shirt.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.harpersbazaar.com/fashion/street-style/paris-street-style-spring-2014-2036#slide-77&lt;/ref&gt; Contemporary T-shirt designers like [[Balmain (fashion house)|Balmain]] and Street People Atelier produce new styles of T-shirts.

== World record ==

The current holder of the Guinness World Record for &quot;Most T-Shirts Worn at Once&quot; with 257 T-shirts is Sanath Bandara.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/records-3000/most-T-Shirts-worn-at-once/ |title=Most T-shirts worn at once |publisher=Guinness World Records |accessdate=2012-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The record was set in Colombo, Sri Lanka, on December 22, 2011. The record was attempted on stage in front of a crowd of people in a public park in Colombo. Bandara surpassed previous record-holder [[Hwang Kwanghee]] from South Korea, who had held the record at 252 shirts.

[[File:Natalie Coughlin and Dara Torres.jpg|thumb|right|Various swimmers' garments]]
A '''skin-tight garment''' is a [[garment]] that is held to the skin usually by [[elasticity (solid mechanics)|elastic tension]] using some type of [[stretch fabric]]. Commercial stretch fabrics ('[[elastomeric]]s') such as [[spandex]] or [[elastane]] (widely branded as 'Lycra') came onto the market in 1962, and revolutionized many areas of the clothing industry. A wide variety of clothing may be made to be skin-tight, and it is common for clothing to be skin-tight for some uses, such as in [[stocking]]s, [[bodystocking]]s, [[swimsuit]]s and women's [[brassiere|bra]]s.

==History and types==
===Leotard===
In 1886 the name [[leotard]] was given to a one-piece skin-tight garment that covers the [[torso]] including the [[crotch]], but not the legs or arms. The garment was named after French acrobatic performer [[Jules Léotard]] (1838–1870), many years after his death, who wore the garment in his acrobatic act. In the early 20th century, use of leotards was mainly confined to [[circus]] and [[acrobatic]] shows, but were also worn by professional dancers, such as the [[showgirl]]s of [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]]. Leotards on the stage were typically worn with [[stockings]] or tights. 

In the 1950s, traditionally-styled leotards continued to be worn mainly by stage performers and circus actors, but leotards began to be used as simple and functional exercise garments, often in institutional settings like schools and in fitness training. These were almost always black and worn together with thick tights. Between 1950 and 1970, leotards remained as such in appearance until a style change in the 1970s, when more colorful leotards appeared on the scene, most often in ballet and exercise.

===Swimwear===
The 1920s and 1930s saw leotards influencing [[swimsuit]] styles, with women's [[one-piece swimsuit]]s today still being similar in appearance to leotards. The most common type of one-piece swimsuit is the [[maillot]] or [[tank suit]], which resembles a sleeveless leotard or [[bodysuit]]. In early years the one-piece swimsuit would have a narrow skirt slip or micro-shorts, for modesty considerations, but these were beginning to disappear in the 1940s. A recent innovation in one-piece swimsuits is the [[bodyskin]], which superficially resembles a unitard or [[wetsuit]]. Although these cover the entire torso, arms and legs, their function is not modesty, but reducing friction through the water for professional swimmers. 

===Bodystocking===
A [[bodystocking]] is a one-piece skin-tight garment that covers the torso, legs and sometimes the arms of the wearer. It is a [[foundation garment]] or an article of [[lingerie]] usually made from a [[sheer fabric]] similar to that used for [[stockings]] or [[pantyhose]], or from [[fishnet]], [[lace]] or an opaque material, or a variation of these materials.&lt;ref name=voices&gt;{{cite web|url=http://voices.yahoo.com/bodystockings-sexy-lingerie-many-occasions-695889.html|title=Bodystockings: Sexy Lingerie for Many Occasions|accessdate=26 October 2014|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20140619123326/http://voices.yahoo.com/bodystockings-sexy-lingerie-many-occasions-695889.html|archivedate=19 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A bodystocking differs from a unitard, which is worn as an outfit or article of clothing, and a leotard, which is used as a practice garment or performance costume by acrobats, [[gymnasts]] and other similar performers. Designed to be revealed, but not to be too revealing, bodystockings may be worn as undergarments by performers such as [[belly dancer]]s and [[exotic dancer]]s.

Bodystockings were used on stage in at least 1860s. In 1861, American actress [[Adah Isaacs Menken]] controversially wore a flesh coloured bodystocking on stage, to preserve her [[modesty]] and stay within the [[obscenity]] laws, while giving the illusion of nudity.&lt;ref name=&quot;Brooks&quot;&gt;Brooks, Daphne A. “Lady Menken’s Secret: Adah Isaacs Menken, Actress Biographies and the Race for Sensation.” ''Legacy'', Volume 15. Number 1. (1998): pages 68-77.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.funkybodystockings.co.uk/History-of-Bodystockings_ep_49-1.html#first |title=History of Bodystockings |publisher=Funky Bodystockings |accessdate=2013-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Unitard===
The [[unitard]] is a variation of the leotard that also covers the legs and sometimes also has long sleeves, and which is considered to be a combination of a leotard and tights. It is similar to a bodystocking, but is designed as outerwear, for view by the general public.

===Bodysuit===
A [[bodysuit]] covers the torso and the crotch.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/bodysuit Merriam-webster dictionary]&lt;/ref&gt; The style of a basic bodysuit is similar to a one-piece swimsuit and a leotard, though the materials may vary, and a bodysuit, unlike a swimsuit or leotard, has snaps, hooks or [[velcro]] at the crotch. A bodysuit may have sleeves and varying shoulder strap and collar styles. Bodysuits can be made from a number of fabrics, including [[cotton]], [[lace]], [[nylon]], etc. In general, textile bodysuits include expandable fiber such as [[spandex]] for a better fit to the shape of the body.

A bodysuit is normally worn with [[trousers]] or a [[skirt]], exposing at most the top of the garment above the waist. The top, torso part may act as a top for the smooth line it gives or because it cannot become untucked from trousers or skirt. They may also be worn generally by women as [[underwear]], [[activewear]], or [[foundation garment]]s. Unlike a leotard, a bodysuit is not usually considered a form of athletic wear. The purpose of the opening at the crotch is to facilitate access during a visit to the toilet.

===Stocking and pantyhose===
Modern [[stocking]]s became popular in the 1920s with the rise in women's [[hemline]]s. They were sheer, first made of silk or [[rayon]] (then known as &quot;artificial silk&quot;), and after 1940 of nylon. Nylon stockings were cheap, durable, and sheer compared to their cotton and silk counterparts. These stocking were very popular, and the demand for them has continued, though it has given ground to [[tights]] or [[pantyhose]]. During the 1960s, improved [[textile manufacturing]] processes made pantyhose cheaper, while [[spandex]] (or elastane) made them more comfortable and durable, and the [[miniskirt]] made the pantyhose a necessity to many women. The popularity of pantyhose grew into a wardrobe staple throughout the 1970s and 1980s. From 1995 there was a steady decline in sales of pantyhose, levelling off in 2006 with American sales less than half of what they had once been. 

===Sportswear===
The development and use of stretch fabrics simplified the construction of clothing. First used in swimsuits and women's bras, fashion designers began using them as early as the mid-1980s. They entered the mainstream market in the early 1990s, and are now widely used in [[Sportswear (activewear)|sports clothing]].

'''Pajamas''', or '''pyjamas''' ([[British English]]), often shortened to ''PJs'', ''jimmies'', ''jimjams'' or ''jammies'', can refer to several related types of [[clothing]].

The word ''pyjama'' &lt;ref&gt;http://www.bl.uk/learning/langlit/dic/oed/pyjamas/pyjamas.html&lt;/ref&gt; was incorporated into the English language via the [[British Empire]]  from c. 1800  through the [[Bengali language|Bengali]] {{lang|hi|''pajāmā''}}, itself from the [[Persian language|Persian]] word {{lang |fa|   ''pāy-jāmeh'' (پايجامه }} lit. &quot;leg-garment&quot;). The original ''pyjāmā'' are loose, lightweight [[trousers]] fitted with [[drawstring]] waistbands worn by [[Muslims in India]] and adopted by [[Company rule in India|Europeans there]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thefreedictionary.com/pyjama Dictionary Meaning: ''Pyjama'']; TheFreeDictionary; Free Online Dictionary, Thesaurus, and Encyclopedia; cf. ''The Oxford English Dictionary''. 1989 edition. Oxford University Press. Oxford and London.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The word ''pyjama'' was incorporated into the English language via [[Bengali language|Bengali]]. The word originally derives from [[Persian language|Persian]] {{lang|fa| پايجامه }} ''pāyjāmeh'' meaning 'leg-garment'. The word originally referred to loose trousers tied around the waist.

The worldwide use of pajamas (the word and the garment) is the result of British  presence [[British India|in India]] in the 18th and 19th centuries, and British influence on the wider [[Western world]] during the [[Victorian era]].
Pajamas had been introduced to England as &quot;lounging attire&quot; as early as the 17th century, then known as ''mogul's breeches'' ([[Beaumont and Fletcher]]) but they soon fell out of fashion again. The word ''pajama'' (as  '' pai jamahs'', ''Paee-jams'' and variants) is recorded in English use in the first half of the 19th century,
but they only become a fashion in Britain and the Western world as a sleeping attire for men in the Victorian period, from about 1870.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, Ivor. 1991. ''Sahibs, Nabobs and [[Boxwallah]]s: A Dictionary of Words of Anglo-India.'' Oxford: Oxford University Press. 266 pages. ISBN 0-19-564223-6. &quot;They were introduced in England as lounging attire in the 17th century but soon went out of fashion. About 1870 they reappeared in the Western world as sleeping attire for men, after returning British colonials brought (them) back ....&quot;  Encyclopedia Britannica.

''[[Hobson-Jobson|Hobson-Jobson: A Glossary of Colloquial Anglo-Indian Words and Phrases]]'' (1886) summarizes the state of usage at the time (s.v. &quot;pyjammas&quot;):
{{cquote|Such a garment is used by various persons in India ''e.g.'' by women of various classes, by [[Sikh]] men, and most by Mohammedans of both sexes. It was adopted from the Mohammedans by Europeans as an article of ''dishabille'' and of night attire, and is synonymous with Long Drawers, Shulwaurs, and Mogul-Breeches [...] It is probable that we English took the habit like a good many others from the Portuguese.  Thus [[François Pyrard de Laval|Pyrard]] (c. 1610) &lt;!--serving as apothecary in the Portuguese royal hospital in Goa--&gt; says, in speaking of [[Portuguese Goa|Goa]] Hospital: &quot;Ils ont force ''calsons'' sans quoy ne couchent iamais les Portugais des Indes&quot; [...] The word is now used in London shops. A friend furnishes the following reminiscence: &quot;The late Mr. B&amp;mdash;, tailor in Jermyn Street, some on 40 years ago, in reply to a question why pajamas had feet sewn on to them (as was sometimes the case with those furnished by London outfitters) answered: 'I believe, Sir, it is because of the [[white ant|White Ants]].&lt;ref&gt;
Yule, Henry and A.C. Burnell, ''Hobson-Jobson: A Glossary of Colloquial Anglo-Indian Words and Phrases '' (1886), s.v. [https://books.google.com/books?id=6Z5iAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA748 Pyjammas], p. 748.
''Hobson-Jobson'' glosses &quot;white ants&quot; as &quot;The insect (''Termes bellicosus'' of naturalists) not properly an ant, of whose destructive powers there are in India so many disagreeable experiences, and so many marvellous stories.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;}}
&lt;!--Hobson-Jobson cites spelling as ''Paee-jams'' (1828), and ''pyjama'' (1881).--&gt;

==Types==

===Traditional===
''Traditional pajamas'' consist of a [[jacket]]-and-pants combination made of soft [[fabric]], such as [[flannel]];&lt;ref&gt;[http://images.google.com/hosted/life/l?q=%22pyjamas%22&amp;imgurl=c64498a2daa189da &quot;Girl sitting on bed and wearing striped flannel pajamas and Donald Duck slippers.&quot;] ''Life'' magazine, December 1949, (Photographer: [[Nina Leen]]).&lt;/ref&gt; The jacket element usually has a [[placket|placket front]] and its sleeves have no [[cuff]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://images.google.com/hosted/life/l?q=%22pyjamas%22&amp;imgurl=d51443784d17a5d1 &quot;Millionaire Charles Ponzi posing for photograph in pajamas.&quot;] ''Life'' magazine, 1942, (Photographer: Hart Preston).&lt;/ref&gt; For a number of reasons (increased freedom of movement, aesthetic appeal, etc.) many men opt to sleep or lounge barechested in just the pajama pants.

In [[colloquialism|colloquial]] speech, these traditional pajamas are often called ''PJs'', ''jim jams'', or ''jammies'';&lt;ref&gt;[http://images.google.com/hosted/life/l?q=PJ%27s&amp;imgurl=919619162cc29478 &quot;Three college students wearing their PJs and playing in the bunk bed of their dorm room during rush week at the University of Illinois.&quot;] ''Life'' magazine, September 1956 (Photographer: Grey Villet).&lt;/ref&gt; while in South Asia and [[South Africa]], they are sometimes referred to as [[Night suit (South Asia)|night suit]]s.

Some pajamas feature a ''drop seat'' (also known as a ''trap door'' or ''butt flap''): a buttoned opening in the seat, designed to allow the wearer to conveniently use a [[toilet]]. Drop seats were very common on pajamas made before the 1950s, but today they are rather rare.

===Contemporary===
Contemporary pajamas are derived from traditional pajamas. There are many variations in style such as [[sleeve|short sleeve]] pajamas,&lt;ref&gt;[http://images.google.com/hosted/life/l?q=%22pyjamas%22&amp;imgurl=f56feeffe37a7929 &quot;Model wearing cotton-crepe pajamas.&quot;]  ''Life'' magazine, 1939, (Photographer: Alfred Eisenstaedt).&lt;/ref&gt; pajama bottoms&lt;ref&gt;[https://in.amantelingerie.com/nightwear.html?am_style=229 &quot;Pajama Bottoms Nightwear for Women&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt; of varying length,&lt;ref&gt;[http://images.google.com/hosted/life/l?q=pyjamas&amp;imgurl=117ee7ab87cf890e &quot;Harriet Traynham (R) and her guests still wearing their pyjamas at 3:15 pm,&quot;]  ''Life'' magazine, August 1951 (Phtographer: Lisa Larsen)&lt;/ref&gt; or, on occasion, one-piece pajamas,&lt;ref&gt;[http://images.google.com/hosted/life/l?q=%22pyjamas%22&amp;imgurl=fa5a09e987eac7ab &quot;Actress Dorothy McGuire doing morning exercises wearing silk pajamas.&quot;] ''Life'' magazine, 1941, (Photographer: Alfred Eisenstaedt)&lt;/ref&gt; and pajamas incorporating various materials.

Chiefly in the US, [[stretch fabric|stretch-knit]] sleep apparel with [[ribbing (knitting)|rib-knit]] trimmings are common. Usually worn by children, these garments often have [[Sweater|pullover]] tops (if two-piece) or have [[zipper]]s down the fronts (if one-piece), and may also be [[blanket sleeper|footed]].

Although pajamas are usually distinguished from non-[[wikt:Bifurcation|bifurcated]] sleeping garments such as [[nightgown]]s, in the US, they can sometimes include the latter, as in ''[[babydoll|babydoll pyjamas]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://images.google.com/hosted/life/l?q=pyjamas&amp;imgurl=ba76ba26e719e8a3 &quot;Cynthia Brooks standing with her mother who is making alterations on her 'baby doll' pyjamas.&quot;] ''Life'' magazine, March 1957, (Photographer: Peter Stackpole).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Daywear===
Pajamas may today refer to women's combination daywear, especially in the [[US]] where they became popular in the early 20th century, consisting of short-sleeved or [[sleeveless]] [[blouse]]s and lightweight [[pants]]. Examples of these include  ''[[Capri pants|capri]] pajamas'', ''beach pajamas'', and ''hostess pajamas''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://images.google.com/hosted/life/l?q=%22pyjamas%22&amp;imgurl=818036c630c2ad98 &quot;Czech model posing in hostess pajamas.&quot;] ''Life'' magazine, 19]9-;liop[-;pi[l;op68, (Photographer: Bill Ray)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Construction==
Pajamas are usually loose fitting and designed for comfort, using soft materials such as cotton or the more luxurious [[silk]] or [[satin]]. Synthetic materials such as polyester and Lycra are also available.

Pajamas often contain visual references to a thing that may hold some special appeal to the wearer. Images of [[sports]], [[animal]]s, [[balloons]], [[polka dots]], [[flowers]], [[wikt:stripe|stripe]]s, [[Plaid (pattern)|plaids]], [[foulard]]s, [[paisleys]] and other motifs may all be used to decorate them.  Pajamas may also be found in plainer designs, such as plaid or plain gray, but when worn in public, they are usually designed in such a way that makes their identity unambiguous.  Older styles of children's pajamas have been depicted as having a square button-up flap covering the buttocks.

==Sociology==
Pajamas are often worn with [[bare feet]] and sometimes without [[underwear]]. They are often worn as comfort wear even when not in bed.

Some people wear pajamas in public, whether for convenience or as a fashion statement.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/liverpool-news/now-theyre-shopping-pyjamas-shanghai-3462155 &quot;Now they're shopping in pyjamas in Shanghai!&quot;] ''[[Liverpool Echo]]'', 17 January 2009. Retrieved 1 May 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.theguardian.com/business/2010/jan/28/tesco-bans-shopping-bananas-pyjamas&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006 the gulf state of [[UAE]] banned local government workers from wearing pajamas to work.&lt;ref&gt;http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/6200045.stm&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Tesco]] [[supermarket]] in [[Cardiff|St Mellons]], [[Cardiff]], [[United Kingdom]] started a ban on customers wearing pajamas in January 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/8484116.stm |title=Tesco ban on shoppers in pyjamas |publisher=BBC News |date=2010-01-28 |accessdate=2013-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2012, a local Dublin branch of the Government's [[Department of Social Protection]] advised that pajamas were not regarded as appropriate attire when attending the office for welfare services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.broadsheet.ie/2012/01/24/meanwhile-in-blanchardstown |title=Meanwhile, In Blanchardstown |publisher=Broadsheet.ie |date=2012-01-24 |accessdate=2013-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2012, Michael Williams, a [[commissioner]] in [[Caddo Parish, Louisiana]], proposed an ordinance prohibiting people from wearing pajamas in public. Caddo Parish already has a law against wearing [[sagging pants]] below the waist, but Williams is pushing for a law against pajama pants after seeing a group of young men wearing loose fitting pajama pants that were about to show their private parts. According to Williams, &quot;The moral fiber in our community is dwindling. If not now, when? Because it's pajama pants today, next it will be underwear tomorrow.” &lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://newsfeed.time.com/2012/01/17/louisiana-official-moves-to-ban-wearing-pyjamas-in-public/ Louisiana Official Moves to Ban Wearing Pyjamas in Public]&quot; Courtney Subramanian.

Williams’ concerns are reflected in many school and work dress codes. [[Mount Anthony Union High School]] in [[Bennington, Vermont|Bennington]], [[Vermont]], banned pajamas in 2011, concerned that they could be a safety hazard.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.firstamendmentcenter.org/vt-high-school-dress-code-now-bans-pyjamas Vt. high school dress code now bans pyjamas]&quot; Retrieved on April 15, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Travel''' is the movement of [[people]] between relatively distant geographical [[Location (geography)|location]]s, and can involve travel by [[Pedestrian|foot]], [[bicycle]], [[automobile]], [[train]], [[boat]], [[airplane]], or other means, with or without luggage, and can be one way or round trip.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thefreedictionary.com/travel &quot;Travel.&quot;] (definition). [http://www.thefreedictionary.com Thefreedictionary.com]. Accessed July 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/travel &quot;Travel.&quot;] (definition). [http://www.merriam-webster.com Merriam-webster.com]. Accessed July 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Travel can also include relatively short stays between successive movements.

==Etymology==
The origin of the word &quot;travel&quot; is most likely lost to history.  The term &quot;travel&quot; may originate from the [[Old French]] word ''travail''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=travail&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 Entymoligical dictionary] (definition). Retrieved on 10 December 2011 [&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Merriam Webster dictionary, the first known use of the word travel was in the 14th century. It also states that the word comes from Middle English ''travailen'', ''travelen'' (which means to torment, labor, strive, journey) and earlier from Old French ''travailler'' (which means to work strenuously, toil).  In English we still occasionally use the words ''travail'' and ''travails'', which mean struggle.  According to Simon Winchester in his book The Best Travelers' Tales (2004), the words travel and travail both share an even more ancient root: a Roman instrument of torture called the tripalium (in Latin it means &quot;three stakes&quot;, as in to impale).  This link reflects the extreme difficulty of travel in ancient times. Also note the torturous connotation of the word &quot;travailler.&quot;  Today, travel may or may not be much easier depending upon the destination you choose (i.e., [[Mt. Everest]], the [[Amazon rainforest]]), how you plan to get there ([[Bus|tour bus]], [[cruise ship]], or [[Bullock cart|oxcart]]), and whether or not you decide to &quot;rough it (see [[extreme tourism]] and [[adventure travel]]).  &quot;There's a big difference between simply being a tourist and being a true world traveler,&quot; notes travel writer Michael Kasum. This is, however, a contested distinction as academic work on the cultures and sociology of travel has noted.&lt;ref&gt;Buzard, J. (1993) The Beaten Track.

'''New Year's Day''' is observed on [[January 1]], the first day of the year on the modern [[Gregorian calendar]] as well as the [[Julian calendar]]. In pre-Christian Rome under the [[Julian calendar]], the day was dedicated to [[Janus]], god of gateways and beginnings, for whom [[January]] is also named. As a date in the Gregorian calendar of [[Christendom]], New Year's Day liturgically marked the [[Feast of the Circumcision of Christ|Feast of the Naming and Circumcision of Jesus]], which is still observed as such in the [[Anglican Communion|Anglican Church]] and [[Lutheran Church]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=McKim|first=Donald K.|title=Dictionary of Theological Terms|year=1996|publisher=Westminster John Knox Press|isbn=0664255116|pages=51}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hobart|first=John Henry|title=A Companion for the festivals and fasts of the Protestant Episcopal Church|year=1840|publisher=Stanford &amp; Co.|page=284}}&lt;/ref&gt; In present day, with most countries now using the Gregorian calendar as their [[de facto]] calendar, New Year's Day is probably the most celebrated public [[holiday]], often observed with [[fireworks]] at the stroke of [[midnight]] as the new year starts in each time zone. Other global New Years' Day traditions include making [[New Year's resolution]]s and calling one's friends and family.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mehra2006&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Mehra|first=Komal|title=Festivals Of The World|date=2006|publisher=Sterling Publishers |isbn=9781845575748|page=69|quote=In many European countries like Italy, Portugal and Netherlands, families start the new year by attending church services and then calling on friends and relatives.

==History==
[[Image:Menologion of Basil 047.jpg|thumb|200px|In Christendom, under which the Gregorian Calendar developed, New Year's Day traditionally marks the [[Feast of the Circumcision of Christ]], which is still observed as such by the [[Anglican Church]] and the [[Lutheran Church]].]]
Mesopotamia (Iraq) instituted the concept of celebrating the new year in 2000 BC, celebrated new year around the time of the [[vernal equinox]], in mid-March.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.infoplease.com/spot/newyearhistory.html |title=A History of the New Year |first=Borgna |last=Brunner |publisher=Infoplease.com |accessdate=31 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.history.com/news/history-lists/5-ancient-new-years-celebrations |title=5 Ancient New Year’s Celebrations |first=Evan |last=Andrews |newspaper=History News |date=31 December 2012 |accessdate=31 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The early Roman calendar designated [[March 1]] as the new year. The calendar had just ten months, beginning with March. That the new year once began with the month of March is still reflected in some of the names of the months. [[September]] through [[December]], our ninth through twelfth months, were originally positioned as the seventh through tenth months (septem is [[Latin]] for &quot;seven,&quot; octo is &quot;eight,&quot; novem is &quot;nine,&quot; and decem is &quot;ten.&quot;)

The first time the new year was celebrated on January 1st was in Rome in 153 B.C. (In fact, the month of January did not even exist until around 700 B.C., when the second king of Rome, [[Numa Pontilius]], added the months of January and February.) The new year was moved from March to January because that was the beginning of the civil year, the month that the two newly elected [[Roman consuls]] - the highest officials in the Roman republic - began their one-year tenure. But this new year date was not always strictly and widely observed, and the new year was still sometimes celebrated on March 1.

In [[46 B.C.]] [[Julius Caesar]] extend year to 445 days ([[annus confusionis]]). The normal number of 355 days had already been increased by the addition of the ordinary 23 days, inserted after Feb. 23. As many as 67 days, divided into two menses intercalares . . . were now interposed between November and December. . . . This year thus consisted of 15 months. After this “year of confusion,” the new calendar really started. Since 153 BC, January 1 was the day new consuls in Rome took office and Romans had commonly used the name of the two consuls to identify a specific year in question.  Thus, by officially making January 1 start the New Year, it simply lined up with the consular year. One proposed reason for this switch is that January is thought by most to have been named after the god of transitions and beginnings, Janus, during the reign of the second King of Rome, Numa Pompilius, who lived from 753-673 BC.  Thus, it was naturally enough for the Romans to eventually decide to make the switch. However, whether this is the reason or not is very much up for debate. There is no consensus on the question.&lt;ref&gt;Michels, A.K. ''The Calendar of the Roman Republic'' (Princeton, 1967), p. 97-8.&lt;/ref&gt; After [[Julius Caesar]] reformed the calendar in 46 BC as the [[Julian Calendar]] and was subsequently murdered, the [[Roman Senate]] voted to deify him on 1 January 42 BC,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Warrior |first=Valerie |year=2006 |title=Roman Religion |publisher=Cambridge University Press |pages=110 |isbn=0-521-82511-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; in honor of his life and his institution of the new rationalized calendar.&lt;ref&gt;Courtney, G. ''Et tu Judas, then fall Jesus'' (iUniverse, Inc 1992), p. 50.&lt;/ref&gt; Dates in March, coinciding with the [[March Equinox]], the [[Solemnity of the Annunciation]] of [[Jesus Christ]], or other Christian feasts were used throughout the [[Middle Ages]] as the first day of the new year, although their calendars nonetheless often continued to display the months in columns running from January to December.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}

In [[567 A.D.]] the [[Council of Tours]] abolished January 1 as the beginning of the year. At various times and in various places throughout medieval [[Christian Europe]], the new year was celebrated on [[Dec. 25]], the birth of [[Jesus]]; [[March 1]]; [[March 25]], the [[Feast of the Annunciation]]; and [[Easter]].

Among the 7th century [[pagan]]s of [[Flanders]] and the [[Netherlands]], it was the custom to exchange gifts on the first day of the new year. This custom was deplored by [[Saint Eligius]] (died 659 or 660), who warned the Flemish and Dutch: &quot;(Do not) make vetulas, [little figures of the Old Woman], little deer or iotticos or set tables [for the house-elf, compare [[Puck (mythology)|Puck]]] at night or exchange New Year gifts or supply superfluous drinks [another [[Yule]] custom].&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Quoting the ''Vita'' of St. Eligius written by [[Audoin (bishop)|Ouen]].&lt;/ref&gt; However, on the date that European Christians celebrated the New Year, they exchanged Christmas presents because New Years' Day fell within the twelve days of the [[Christmastide|Christmas season]] in the [[Western Christianity|Western Christian]] liturgical [[kalendar]];&lt;ref name=&quot;Forbes2008&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Forbes|first=Bruce David|title=Christmas: A Candid History|accessdate=30 December 2015|date=1 October 2008|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=9780520258020|page=114|quote=Some people referred to New Year's gifts as &quot;Christmas presents&quot; because New Year's Day fell within the twelve days of Christmas, but in spite of the name they still were gifts given on January 1.}}&lt;/ref&gt; the custom of exchanging Christmas gifts in a Christian context is traced back to the [[Biblical Magi]] who gave gifts to the [[Child Jesus]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Collins2010&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Collins|first=Ace|title=Stories Behind the Great Traditions of Christmas|accessdate=30 December 2015|date=4 May 2010|publisher=Harper Collins|isbn=9780310873884|page=88|quote=Most people today trace the practice of giving gifts on Christmas Day to the three gifts that the Magi gave to Jesus.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Berking1999&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Berking|first=Helmuth|title=Sociology of Giving|accessdate=24 December 2015|date=30 March 1999|publisher=SAGE Publications|isbn=9780857026132|page=14|quote=The winter solstice was a time of festivity in every traditional culture, and the Christian Christmas probably took its place within this mythical context of the solar cult. Its core dogma of the Incarnation, however, solidly established the giving and receiving of gifts as the structural principle of that recurrent yet unique event. 'Children were given presents as the Jesus child received gifts from the magi or kings who came from afar to adore him. But in reality it was they, together with all their fellow men, who received the gift of God through man's renewed participation in the divine life' (ibid.: 61).}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[1582]], the Gregorian calendar reform restored January 1 as New Year's Day. When the new calendar was put in use, the error accumulated in the 13 centuries since the Council of Nicaea was corrected by a deletion of 10 days. The Julian calendar day Thursday, 4 October 1582 was followed by the first day of the Gregorian calendar, Friday, 15 October 1582 (the cycle of weekdays was not affected), So January 1 is after Winter Solstice 10 days now. Although most Catholic countries adopted the Gregorian calendar almost immediately, it was only gradually adopted among Protestant countries. The British, for example, did not adopt the reformed calendar until [[1752]]. Until then, the [[British Empire]] —and their American colonies— still celebrated the new year in March.

Most nations of [[Western Europe]] officially adopted 1 January as New Year's Day somewhat before they adopted the [[Gregorian Calendar]]. In [[Tudor England]], New Years Day, along with [[Christmas Day]] and [[Twelfth Night (holiday)|Twelfth Night]], was celebrated as one of three main festivities among the [[Twelve Days of Christmas|twelve days]] of [[Christmastide]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Sim2011&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Sim|first=Alison|title=Pleasures and Pastimes in Tudor England|accessdate=30 December 2015|date=8 November 2011|publisher=The History Press|isbn=9780752475783|page=85|quote=Most of the twelve days of Christmas were saint's days, but the main three days for celebration were Christmas Day, New Year's Day and Epiphany, or Twelfth Night.}}&lt;/ref&gt; There, until the adoption of the Gregorian Calendar in 1752, the first day of the new year was the Western Christian [[Feast of the Annunciation]], on 25 March, also called &quot;[[Lady Day]]&quot;. Dates predicated on the year beginning on 25 March became known as ''Annunciation Style'' dates, while dates of the Gregorian Calendar commencing on 1 January were distinguished as ''Circumcision Style'' dates,&lt;ref name=&quot;Harris2011&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Harris|first=Max|title=Sacred Folly: A New History of the Feast of Fools|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GOMAn_rIUIAC&amp;pg=PA35|accessdate=31 December 2012|date=2011-03-17|publisher=Cornell University Press|isbn=9780801449567|page=35}}&lt;/ref&gt; because this was the date of the [[Feast of the Circumcision]], the observed memorial of the eighth day of [[Jesus Christ]]'s life after his birth, counted from the latter's observation on [[Christmas]], 25 December. [[Pope Gregory XIII|Pope Gregory]] christened 1 January as the beginning of the new year according to his reform of the Catholic [[Liturgical Calendar]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Trawicky2000&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Trawicky|first=Bernard|title=Anniversaries and Holidays|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gDbKexa1jfcC&amp;pg=PA222|accessdate=31 December 2012|edition=5th|date=2000-07-01|publisher=American Library Association|isbn=9780838906958|page=222}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==New Year's Days in other calendars==
In cultures which traditionally or currently use calendars other than the Gregorian, New Year's Day is often also an important celebration. Some countries concurrently use the Gregorian and another calendar. New Year's Day in the alternative calendar attracts alternative celebrations of that new year:

===African===
* [[Enkutatash|Ethiopian New Year]] called Enkutatash. It is celebrated on September 11 (September 12 in leap years). Ethiopia uses its own ancient calendar, which was based on the Julian calendar.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title=Time and dates in Ithiopia [sic] | url=http://www.rastaites.com/Ethiopia/newyear.htm | publisher=Rasta Ites | accessdate={{Date|2013-10-29}} }}&lt;/ref&gt; The new year is the end of the summer rainy season.
* The [[Odunde Festival]] is also called the &quot;African New Year&quot; is celebrated in [[Philadelphia]], [[Pennsylvania]] in the [[United States]] on the second Sunday of June.  While the name was based on the [[Yoruba language|Yoruba]] African culture, its celebration marks the largest African celebration in the world, which more or less was started by a local tradition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://philadelphia.cbslocal.com/2013/05/13/oshunbumi-fernandez-caring-through-culture-and-odunde-365/ | title=Oshunbumi Fernandez, Caring Through Culture and Odunde 365 | publisher=CBS Philadelphia | first=Cherri | last=Gregg | date=May 13, 2013 | accessdate=31 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*[[Indian New Year's days]] has several variations depending on the region and is based on the [[Hindu calendar]].
*[[Hindu]] In Hinduism, different regional cultures celebrate new year at different times of the year. In Assam, Bengal, Kerala, Nepal, Odisha, Punjab and Tamil Nadu, households celebrate the new year when the Sun enters [[Aries (astrology)|Aries]] on the [[Hindu calendar]]. This is normally on April 14 or April 15, depending on the leap year. Elsewhere in northern/central India, the [[Vikram Samvat]] calendar is followed. According to that the new year day is the first day of the Chaitra Month, also known as Chaitra Shukla Pratipada or [[Gudi Padwa]].  This basically is the first month of the Hindu calendar, the first shukla paksha (fortnight) and the first day.   This normally comes around March 23–24, mostly around the Spring Equinox in Gregorian Calendar. The new year is celebrated by paying respect to elders in the family and by seeking their blessings. They also exchange tokens of good wishes for a healthy and prosperous year ahead.
*[[Malayalam]] New Year (Puthuvarsham) is celebrated either on the first day of the month of Medam in mid-April which is known as Vishu or the first day of the month of [[Chingam]], in the [[Malayalam Calendar]] in mid-August according to another reckoning. Unlike most other calendar systems in India, the New Year's Day on the [[Malayalam Calendar]] is not based on any astronomical event. It is just the first day of the first of the twelve months on the [[Malayalam Calendar]].  The [[Malayalam Calendar]] (called Kollavarsham) originated in 825 CE, based on general agreement among scholars, with the re-opening of the city of [[Kollam]] (on [[Malabar Coast]]), which had been destroyed by a [[natural disaster]].
*[[Nepal Sambat]] is the '''Nepalese New Year''' celebration, which also coincides with the Diwali festival.
*The Sikh New Year is celebrated as per the [[Nanakshahi calendar]]. The epoch of this calendar is the birth of the first [[The Sikh Gurus|Sikh Guru]], [[Guru Nanak]] in 1469. New Year's Day falls annually on what is March 14 in the Gregorian Western calendar.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sgpc.net/festivals/nanakshahi.asp Nanakshahi Calendar at SGPC.net&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Sinhalese New Year]] is celebrated in Sri Lankan culture predominantly by the Sri Lankan Sinhalese, while the [[Tamil people|Tamil]] New Year on the same day is celebrated by Sri Lankan Tamils. The Sinhalese New Year (''aluth avurudda''), marks the end of harvest season, by the month of Bak (April) between April 13 and April 14. There is an astrologically generated time gap between the passing year and the New Year, which is based on the passing of the sun from the Meena Rashiya (House of Pisces) to the Mesha Rashiya (House of Aries) in the celestial sphere. The astrological time difference between the New Year and the passing year (''nonagathe'') is celebrated with several Buddhist rituals and customs that are to be concentrated on, which are exclusive of all types of 'work'. After Buddhist rituals and traditions are attended to, Sinhala and Tamil New Year-based social gatherings and festive parties with the aid of firecrackers, and fireworks would be organized. The exchange of gifts, cleanliness, the lighting of the oil lamp, making ''kiribath'' (Milk rice), and even the Asian Koel are significant aspects of the Sinhalese New Year.
*[[Tamil people|Tamil]] New Year ([[Puthandu]]) is celebrated on April 13 or April 14. Traditionally, it is celebrated as [[Chiththirai Thirunaal]] in parts of Tamil Nadu to mark the event of the Sun entering Aries. [[Panchangam]] ([[almanac]]), is read in temples to mark the start of the Year.
*[[Telugu people|Telugu]] New Year ([[Ugadi]]), [[Kannada]] New Year ([[Yugadi]]) is celebrated in March (generally), April (occasionally). Traditionally, it is celebrated as Chaitram [[Chaitra Shuddha Padyami]] in parts of Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka to mark the event of New Year's Day for the people of the Deccan region of India. It falls on a different day every year because the Hindu calendar is a lunisolar calendar. The Saka calendar begins with the month of Chaitra (March–April) and Ugadi/Yugadi marks the first day of the new year. Chaitra is the first month in Panchanga which is the Indian calendar. [[Panchangam]] ([[almanac]]), is read in temples to mark the start of the Year.

===New Year's Eve===
{{Main|New Year's Eve}}
[[Image:OperaSydney-Fuegos2006-342289398.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|[[Sydney]] contributes to some of the major New Year celebrations each year.]]
January 1 represents the fresh start of a new year after a period of remembrance of the passing year, including on radio, television, and in newspapers, which starts in early December in countries around the world. Publications have year-end articles that review the changes during the previous year. In some cases publications may set their entire year work alight in hope that the smoke emitted from the flame brings new life to the company.  There are also articles on planned or expected changes in the coming year.

This day is traditionally a [[Religious festival|religious feast]], but since the [[1900–1909|1900s]] has also become an occasion to celebrate the night of December 31, called New Year's Eve. There are [[fireworks]] at midnight at the moment the new year arrives (a major one is in [[Sydney]], Australia). [[Watchnight service]]s are also still observed by many.&lt;ref name=&quot;BOW&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.interpretermagazine.org/interior.asp?ptid=43&amp;mid=11612| title = Watch Night services provide spiritual way to bring in New Year|publisher = [[The United Methodist Church]]|accessdate = 28 December 2011|quote=The service is loosely constructed with singing, spontaneous prayers and testimonials, and readings, including the Covenant Renewal service from The United Methodist Book of Worship (pp. 288-294).}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Regional celebrations===
* In [[Europe]]an countries, the New Year is greeted with private [[fireworks]].
* On New Year's Day, people in certain countries gather on beaches and run into the water to celebrate the new year. In [[Canada]], the [[Republic of Ireland]], the [[United Kingdom]], the United States, and the [[Netherlands]] this is very popular. These events are sometimes known as [[polar bear plunge]]s, and are sometimes organized by groups to raise money for [[Charitable organization|charity]]. [[Polar Bear Clubs]] in many [[Northern Hemisphere]] cities near bodies of water, have a tradition of holding organized plunges on New Year's Day.

===National celebrations===

* In [[Russia]] and the other 14 former republics of the [[Soviet Union]], the celebration of [[Novi God]] is greeted by fireworks and drinking champagne. Because religion was suppressed in the [[Soviet Union]] the New Year holiday took on many attributes associated with [[Christmas]] in other countries, including [[Christmas trees]], [[Ded Moroz]] (a variant of [[Santa Claus]]) and family celebrations with lavish food and gifts. In [[Moscow]], the president of Russia counts down the final seconds of the &quot;old year&quot;. The [[Kremlin]]'s landmark Spassky Clock Tower chimes in the new year and then the anthem starts. It is customary to make a wish while the Clock chimes. The [[Old New Year]] is celebrated on January 13 (equivalent to January 1 in the &quot;old style&quot; Julian calendar). Although not an official holiday, it marks the end of the holiday season and is usually when people take down trees and other decorations.
* In [[Davos]], [[Switzerland]], the final match of the [[Spengler Cup]] [[ice hockey]] [[Tournament]] is usually held on this day by tradition.
* In the [[United States]], it is traditional to spend this occasion together with loved ones. A [[Toast (honor)|toast]] is made to the new year, with kisses, fireworks and parties among the customs. It is popular to make a [[New Year's resolution]], although that is optional. In the country's most famous New Year celebration in [[New York City]], the 11,875-pound (5,386-kg), 12-foot-diameter (3.7-m) [[Times Square Ball]] located high above [[One Times Square]] is lowered starting at 11:59 pm, with a countdown from sixty seconds until one second, when it reaches the bottom of its tower. The arrival of the new year is announced at the stroke of [[midnight]] with [[fireworks]], music and a [[Dick Clark's New Year's Rockin' Eve with Ryan Seacrest|live celebration]] that is broadcast worldwide. ([[List of objects dropped on New Year's Eve|Hundreds of local imitations of the ball drop]] also occur throughout the United States.)
*In France,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |trans_title=World Festival |editor=Yue Feng |script-title=zh:世界节 |language=Chinese|year=1991 |isbn13=978-7211058990 |url=http://www.amazon.com/World-Festival-paperback-YUE-FENG/dp/7211058994 |website=Amazon.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; some regard the weather as the prediction of that year: wind blowing east, fruit will yield; wind blowing west, fish and livestock will be bumper; wind blowing south, there will be good weather all year round and wind blowing north, there will be crop failure. People would like to toast for the new year.
*In Spain, it is customary to have 12 grapes at hand when the clock strikes 12 at midnight. One grape is eaten on each stroke. If all the grapes are eaten within the period of the strikes, it means good luck in the new year.&lt;ref name=&quot;Medina2005&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Medina|first=F.

===New Year's Day===
[[File:stoatsdook1.jpg|thumb|The Annual Stoats Loony Dook held in Edinburgh, Scotland on the 1st January.]]
The celebrations held world-wide on January 1 as part of New Year's Day commonly include the following:
* [[Parade]]s
* [[American football]]: In the United States, January 1 is the traditional date for many post-season [[college football]] [[bowl games]], which are usually accompanied by parades and other activities to celebrate the events
* [[Association football|Football]]: In Europe, Association Football, where a Full Fixture programme{{clarify|date=December 2010|does this mean a full schedule?}} is usually played throughout the Premier League and the rest of the League/Non League system in England
* [[Ice hockey]], most famously the [[Winter Classic]] in North America, a National Hockey League game that is played outdoors
* [[Concert]]s
* [[Entertainment]], usually enjoyed from the comfort of home
* Family time
* Traditional meals
* Church services
* An annual dip in ice-cold water by hearty individuals, most famously by members of the [[Polar bear plunge|Polar Bear Club]]

===New Year's babies===
A common image used, often as an editorial cartoon, is that of an incarnation of [[Father Time]] (or the &quot;Old Year&quot;) wearing a sash across his chest with the previous year printed on it passing on his duties to the [[Baby New Year]] (or the &quot;New Year&quot;), an infant wearing a sash with the new year printed on it.&lt;ref name=&quot;Birx2009&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Birx|first=H. James|title=Encyclopedia of Time: Science, Philosophy, Theology, &amp; Culture|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=b3ddWSxmi9cC&amp;pg=PA510|accessdate=31 December 2012|date=2009-01-13|publisher=[[Sage Publications]]|isbn=9781412941648|page=510}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Babies born on New Year's Day are commonly called ''New Year babies''. Hospitals, such as the Dyersburg Regional Medical Center&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=Dyersburg State Gazette |url=http://www.stategazette.com/story/1489857.html |title=DRMC rounds up prizes for New Year's baby, Life Choices |publisher=Stategazette.com |date=2008-12-31 |accessdate=2012-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the US, give out prizes to the first baby born in that hospital in the new year. These prizes are often donated by local businesses.  Prizes may include various baby-related items such as [[Infant formula|baby formula]], [[blanket|baby blanket]]s, [[diaper]]s, and [[gift certificate]]s to stores which specialize in baby-related merchandise.

==Other celebrations on January 1==
The [[Orthodox Church]], the [[Anglican Church]], and the [[Lutheran Church]] celebrate the [[Feast of the Circumcision of Christ]] on January 1, based on the belief that if Jesus was born on December 25, then according to Hebrew tradition, his [[circumcision]] would have taken place on the eighth day of his life (January 1). The Roman Catholic Church celebrates on this day the [[Solemnity of Mary, Mother of God]], which is also a [[Holy Day of Obligation]]. In the United States, New Year's Day is a [[postal holiday]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://about.usps.com/news/service-alerts/2011-federal-holidays.htm|title=2011-federal-holidays|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Johann Sebastian Bach]] composed several [[List of Bach cantatas|church cantata]]s for the double occasion:
*[[Singet dem Herrn ein neues Lied, BWV 190]], 1 January 1724
*[[Jesu, nun sei gepreiset, BWV 41]], 1 January 1725
*[[Herr Gott, dich loben wir, BWV 16]], 1 January 1726
*[[Gott, wie dein Name, so ist auch dein Ruhm, BWV 171]], 1 January ?1729
*[[Christmas Oratorio#Part IV|Fallt mit Danken, fallt mit Loben]] 1 January 1735 (Christmas Oratorio Part IV)

'''Graduation''' getting a diploma or [[academic degree]] or the ceremony that is sometimes associated, where students become [[Alumnus|graduates]]. Before the graduation, candidates are referred to as graduands. The date of graduation is often called '''graduation day'''. The graduation ceremony itself is also called '''commencement''', '''convocation''' or '''invocation'''. In the United States and [[Canada]], the term is additionally increasingly being used to refer to the advancement from a primary or secondary school level.
When ceremonies are associated, they usually include a procession of the academic staff and candidates and a [[valediction]]. At the college and university level the faculty will usually wear [[academic dress]] at the formal ceremonies, as will the [[trustees]] and degree candidates.

&quot;Graduation&quot; at the college and university level occurs when the presiding officer confers degrees upon candidates, either individually or en masse, even if graduates physically receive their diploma later at a smaller college or [[academic department|departmental]] ceremony. After degree completion, graduates can be referred to by their graduating year.

In some places, [[Party#Graduation party|graduation parties]] to celebrate graduation from school, college or university are popular. In a recent 2014 nationwide survey in the United States, $985 was the average amount spent on graduation parties&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://graduationparty.com/graduation-party-budgeting.htm|title=Graduation Party Budget|work=graduationparty.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Academic graduation by country==
{{Further|Academic graduation by country}}

The procedures and traditions surrounding academic graduation ceremonies differ around the world. Whereas in most countries a graduation usually only occurs at university level, in the United States graduations often occur at high schools where no higher education qualifications are conferred upon the graduates. In a graduation ceremony the students dress up in special graduation caps and clothing that are made just for this purpose.

Graduation traditions are varied across universities observing different cultures. Most universities across Sweden are research-oriented and may present its students with bachelor's, master's, and doctor's degrees covering all academic streams. Universities across the country are based through the Higher Education Ordinance. A large number of candidates continue their education onto secondary and upper secondary education. Most of the national programs provide Swedish, English, Math and Science among majors.

In Zimbabwe, graduation ceremonies are often associated with the guest of honor who most of is the ceremonial head of the institution. At state universities the President of Zimbabwe officiates as chancellor and guest of honor. Every graduate of a state university in Zimbabwe can claim to have shaken the Presidents hand, which is a really great experience for most after years of hard work. The person most associated with graduation at those institutions is President Robert Gabriel Mugabe. At other State Institutions of higher learning the vice Presidents or any other Senior Government officials may preside.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = President Mugabe caps 1 986 at Nust {{!}} The Herald|url = http://www.herald.co.zw/president-mugabe-caps-1-986-at-nust/|website = www.herald.co.zw|accessdate = 2015-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin and tradition for caps==
[[File:Square academic cap (graduation hats).JPG|thumb|left|300px|[[Square academic cap|Graduation hats]] being tossed by fresh graduates in [[Indian School of Business|ISB]] ([[Hyderabad]], India).]]
The tradition of wearing graduation hats in Sweden has been in place since the mid 18th century. The cap is typically a white sailor hat with a black or dark blue band around it, a crown motif and a black peak at the front.

The graduation hat tradition was initially brought into practice by students at [[Uppsala University]]. The headgear then became popular across several other European nations as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.academia.edu/8202511/Swedish_high_school_graduation_day|title=Swedish high school graduation day|author=Elin Olsson|work=academia.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Without caps==

After being vested the power to award its own degrees from the [[University of London]] in 2006,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.kcl.ac.uk/aboutkings/governance/about/index.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; graduates of [[King's College London]] began wearing in 2008 an [[Academic dress of King's College London|academic dress]] that does not feature a hat. Designed by [[Vivienne Westwood]], the academic dress features instead an overly-sized hood that could be worn as a headgear by the graduands&lt;ref name=&quot;Westwood&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.kcl.ac.uk/newsevents/publications/comment-archive/pdfs/2008/comment-183.pdf|title=Westwood unveils gowns|accessdate=24 June 2015 | location=London | first=Marion | last=Hume | date=September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the influence of the [[Academic dress of the University of London|University of London]]'s tradition, being the first university in the world to devise a system of academic dress based on faculty colours,&lt;ref&gt;Groves, N. et al.

A '''ceremony''' ({{IPAc-en|UK|'|s|ɛ|r|ɪ|m|ə|n|i}}, {{IPAc-en|US|ˈ|s|ɛ|r|ə|ˌ|m|oʊ|n|i}}) is an event of [[ritual]] significance, performed on a special occasion. The word may be of [[Etruscan language|Etruscan]] origin, via the Latin ''[[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#caerimonia|caerimonia]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Grimes|first=Ronald L.|editor=Willi Braun, Russell T. McCutcheon|title=Guide to the study of religion|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wlNJQoZlGC4C&amp;pg=PA260|year=2000|publisher=Continuum International Publishing Group|isbn=0304701769|page=260|chapter=Ritual}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ceremonial occasions==
A ceremony may mark a [[rite of passage]] in a human life, marking the significance of, for example:

* [[childbirth|birth]]
* [[initiation]] (college [[orientation week]])
* [[puberty]]
* social [[adulthood]] ([[Bar Mitzvah|Bar (or Bat) Mitzvah]])
* [[graduation]]
* [[award ceremony|awarding]]
* [[retirement]]
* [[death]] ([[Day of the Dead]])
* [[burial]] ([[funeral]])
* [[spirituality|spiritual]] ([[baptism]], [[Communion (Christian)|communion]])

==Celebration of events==
Other, society-wide ceremonies may mark annual or seasonal or recurrent events such as:

* vernal [[equinox]], [[winter solstice]] and other annual astronomical positions
* weekly [[Sabbath in Christianity|Sabbath]] day
* [[inauguration]] of an elected office-holder
* occasions in a [[liturgical year]] or &quot;feasts&quot; in a [[calendar of saints]]
* Opening and closing of a sports event, such as the [[Olympic Games ceremony|Olympic Games]]

Other ceremonies underscore the importance of non-regular special occasions, such as:

* [[coronation]] of a [[monarch]]
* victory in [[battle]]

In some Asian cultures, ceremonies also play an important social role, for example the [[tea ceremony]].

==Process==
Ceremonies may have a physical display or [[theatre|theatrical]] component: [[dance]], a [[procession]], the laying on of hands. A declaratory verbal pronouncement may explain or cap the occasion, for instance:

* I now pronounce you husband and wife.
* I swear to serve and defend the nation ...
* I declare open the games of ...
* I/We dedicate this ...  ... to ...

Both physical and verbal components of a ceremony may become part of a [[liturgy]].

[[Image:Nylonstockings.jpg|right|thumb|A pair of dark grey nylon stockings.]]
'''Stockings''' (also known as '''[[Hose (clothing)|hose]]''', especially in a historical context) are close-fitting, variously elastic [[clothing|garment]]s covering the leg from the foot up to the knee or possibly part or all of the [[thigh]]. Stockings vary in color, design, and [[Sheer fabric|transparency]]. Today, stockings are primarily worn for fashion and [[aesthetics]], usually in association with mid-length [[skirt]]s.

By analogy, the term &quot;stocking&quot; is also used to describe a type of [[horse markings|horse marking]] in which the white coloring extends from the horse's hoof to just above the knee.

==History==
[[File:KronenbergStockings.JPG|thumb|Kronenberg brand stocking from mid 20th century from the permanent collection of the [[Museo del Objeto del Objeto]].]]
[[File:NMA.0028271, Fashion Photo by Erik Liljeroth 1954.jpg|thumb|Examining the quality of nylon stockings, [[Malmö]] Strumpfabrik 1954.]]
Historically, even though the word ''sock'' is at least as ancient in origin, what men normally wore were often referred to as stockings, probably especially when referring to longer hose.&lt;ref&gt;Oxford English Dictionary, quotations{{clarify|date=March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Verify source|date=March 2013}} The word ''stock'' used to refer to the bottom &quot;stump&quot; part of the body, and by [[analogy]] the word was used to refer to the one-piece covering of the lower trunk and limbs of the 15th century—essentially [[tights]] consisting of the ''upper-stocks'' (later to be worn separately as knee breeches) and ''nether-stocks'' (later to be worn separately as ''stockings'').  (See [[Hose (clothing)|Hose]].)

Before the 1590s, stockings were made of woven cloth. The first [[knitting machine]]s were for making stockings.&lt;ref&gt;''Elizabethan England'' by Kathy Elgin [http://books.google.com.au/books?id=tlH7xI1M4GwC&amp;pg=PA49&amp;lpg=PA49&amp;dq=elizabethan+knitting+machine+stockings&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=b2EbJPwDbh&amp;sig=1-Mp8rtMcDf59jEIaKjMXdv6FTU&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=ZXTmTN2cFc_Xcf-L3YcL&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CCEQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false] ISBN 978-0-8160-5946-1&lt;/ref&gt; The stockings themselves were made of cotton, [[linen]], [[wool]] or [[silk]]. A polished cotton called [[Cotton|lisle]] was common, as were those made in the town of [[Balbriggan]].

Before the 1920s, stockings, if worn, were worn for warmth. In the 1920s, as [[hemline]]s of dresses rose, women began to wear stockings to cover their exposed legs. Those stockings were sheer, first made of silk or [[rayon]] (then known as &quot;artificial silk&quot;) and after 1940 of [[nylon]].

The introduction of nylon in 1939 by chemical company [[DuPont]] began a high demand for stockings in the United States with up to 4 million pairs being purchased in one day. Nylon stockings were cheap, durable, and sheer compared to their cotton and silk counterparts. When America entered [[World War II]], DuPont ceased production of nylon stockings and retooled their factories to produce parachutes, airplane cords, and rope. This led to a shortage and the creation of a [[black market]] for stockings. At the end of the war DuPont announced that the company would return to producing stockings, but could not meet demand. This led to a series of disturbances in American stores known as the [[nylon riots]] until DuPont was able to ramp up production.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nylonstory&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=Nylon: The Story of a Fashion Revolution |first=Susannah |last=Handley |publisher=Johns Hopkins Univ. Press |year=1999 |page=48 |isbn= 0-8018-6325-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A precursor of [[pantyhose]] made an appearance in the 1940s and 1950s, when film and theater productions had stockings sewn to the briefs of actresses and dancers, according to actress-dancer [[Ann Miller]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video|people=Robert Osborne (Host)|date=1997-08-20|title=Private Screenings: Ann Miller|format=Television production|publisher=Turner Classic Movies}}&lt;/ref&gt; and seen in popular films such as [[Daddy Long Legs (1955 film)|''Daddy Long Legs'']]. Today, stockings are commonly made using [[knitting|knitted]] wool, silk, cotton or nylon (see [[hosiery]]). The introduction of commercial pantyhose in 1959 gave an alternative to stockings, and the use of stockings declined dramatically. A main reason for this was the trend towards higher hemlines on dresses (see [[minidress]]). In 1970, U.S. sales of pantyhose exceeded stockings for the first time, and has remained this way ever since.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Christensen|first=C. Roland|title=Business Policy: Text and Cases|publisher=R.D. Irwin|year=1982|isbn=0-256-02626-2|page=161}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning in 1987, sales of pantyhose started a slight decline due to the newly invented hold-ups, but still remain the most sold kind of hosiery.

==Benefits and drawbacks==
{{unreferenced section|date=March 2013}}{{original research|section|date=March 2013}}
Stockings are still sometimes preferred to [[pantyhose]] for a number of reasons. These may include the perception that stockings, and the associated use of [[Garter (stockings)|garter]]s, [[Lace-making|lace]], high fashion, [[appliqué]] and the exposure of the thigh, are more aesthetically pleasing, or sexually attractive and alluring than pantyhose. They are also regarded as cleaner and healthier, while pantyhose tends to create a humid and warm environment in the crotch area, increasing perspiration and potentially promoting fungal and bacterial growth. Stockings, on the other hand, provide ventilation in the crotch, resulting in a reduction of fungal and bacterial growth. Both nylon stockings and pantyhose being sheer share the advantage of being quick-drying compared to pants if say caught in a downpour or if you are splashed by a passing car driving through a puddle. As ever spare pairs are also easy to carry if they are ruined. If laddered they can be replaced 'one at a time' which obviously saves money and is an advantage over tights. 

However, stockings do have a drawback in colder weather, because more skin is exposed to the cold compared to pantyhose. Also, pantyhose does not require garters and garter belts, and do not need to be adjusted as much, whilst also leaving a smoother line under [[form-fitting clothing]].

==Support==
{{unreferenced section|date=March 2013}}{{original research|section|date=March 2013}}
[[Image:Garter belt.jpg|thumb|right|A garter belt with [[guipure]] lace]]
Stockings can be held up in one of three ways:
[[Image:Legs in black stockings.jpg|right|thumb|150px|A woman wearing [[Hold-ups|stay-up stockings]] held up by elastic]]

*A [[Garter belts|garter belt]] ([[American English|AmE]]), or suspender belt or suspenders ([[British English|BrE]]), is the most common way of holding up stockings. It is a piece of [[underwear]] worn around the waist like a belt but under clothing which has &quot;suspenders&quot; or &quot;stays&quot; that clip to the tops of the stockings.
*[[Hold-ups|&quot;Stay-ups&quot;]] are the second most common means of support. The inside of the top of the stockings has a band (typically [[silicone]]) of elastic or highly tractive material that resists slipping down the thigh. However, there is no consistent sizing for differences in thigh circumference, resulting in some stockings either falling down or being too tight, leaving red marks and possibly aggravating [[varicose veins]].{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}
*A [[garter (stockings)|garter]] is the least common means of support. It is slipped over the top of the stocking to hold the stocking by essentially clamping it to the leg. These are the garters typically worn by a bride at her wedding. They have similar disadvantages to &quot;stay-ups&quot;.

==Terminology==
{{unreferenced section|date=March 2013}}{{original research|section|date=March 2013}}
[[Image:Fishnet stockings from below.jpg|right|thumb|150px|[[Fencenet]] hosiery.]]
In modern usage, ''stocking'' specifically refers to the form of hosiery configured as two pieces, one for each leg (except for American and [[Australian English]], where the term can also be a synonym pantyhose). The term hold-ups and thigh highs refers to stockings that stay up by the use of built-in elastic, while the word stockings is the general term or refers to the kind of stockings that need a suspender belt (garter belt, in [[American English]]), and are quite distinct from [[tights]] or pantyhose (American English).

Other terms used with stockings include:

* Cuban heel: A stocking with a heel made with folded over and sewn reinforcement.
* Demi-toe: Stockings which have a reinforced toe with half the coverage on top as on the bottom. This results in a reinforcement that covers only the tip of the toes as opposed to the whole toe. These can be with or without a reinforced heel.
* [[Denier (measure)|Denier]]: The lower the denier number the sheerer the garment. Stockings knitted with a higher denier tend to be less sheer but more durable.
* [[Fishnet (material)|Fishnet]]: Knitted stockings with a very wide open knit resembling a [[fish net]].
* Fencenet: Similar to fishnet, but with a much wider pattern.  These are sometimes worn over another pair of stockings or pantyhose, such as matte or opaque, with a contrasting colour. Sometimes referred to as whalenets.
* [[Fully fashioned stockings|Full Fashioned]]: Fully fashioned stockings are knitted flat, the material is then cut and the two sides are then united by a seam up the back. Fully fashioned stockings were the most popular style until the 1960s.
* [[Hold-ups]] (British English) or [[Stay-ups]]: Stockings that are held up by sewn-in elasticated bands (quite often a wide lace top band).  In the US they are referred to as thigh-highs.
* [[Knee-Highs]]: Stockings that terminate at or just barely below the knee. Also known as half-stockings, trouser socks, or socks.
* Matte: Stockings which have a dull or non-lustre finish.
* Mock seam: A false seam sewn into the back of a seamless stocking.
* Nude heel: Stockings without reinforcement in the heel area.
* Opaque: Stockings made of yarn which give them a heavier appearance (usually 40 denier or greater).
* Point heel: in a Fully Fashioned stocking it is a heel in which the reinforced part ends in a triangle shape.
* RHT: Abbreviation of reinforced heel and toe.
* Open-toed: Stockings that stop at the base of the toe with a piece that goes between the first and second toes to hold them down. They can be worn with some open-toed shoes, especially to show off pedicured toes.
* Sandalfoot: Stockings with a nude toe, meaning no heavier yarn in the toe than is in the leg. They are intended to be worn with sandal or open-toe shoes.
* [[Fully fashioned stockings|Seamed]]: Stockings manufactured in the old Full-Fashioned manner with a seam running up the back of the leg. In the past they were manufactured by cutting the fabric and then sewing it together. Today, thanks to [[Pio Chiaruttini]] who patented this new technique, stockings are generally fully knitted and a fake or mock seam is added up the back for a particular fashion look. Some brands also produce seamed hold-ups.
* Seamless: Stockings knit in one operation on circular machines (one continuous operation) so that no seaming is required up the back.
* Sheers: Stockings generally of a 15 to 20 denier.
* Stocking Feet: Shoeless feet covered by stockings or socks.
* [[Suspender belt]] ([[British English]]) or [[Garter belt]] (American English): a belt with straps to keep stockings (not hold-ups) on place: usually they have 4 straps, but may have also 6 or 8.
* [[Ultra sheer]]: A fine denier fiber which gives the ultimate in sheerness. Usually 10 denier.
* Welt: A fabric knitted separately and machine-sewn to the top of a stocking. Knit in a heavier denier yarn and folded double to give strength for supporter fastening.

[[File:Athletics competitions.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Competition in sports. A selection of images showing some of the sporting events that are classed as [[Athletics (sport)|athletics]] competitions.]]

'''Competition''' in [[Competition (biology)|biology]] and [[sociology]], is a contest between two or more organisms, animals, individuals, groups, etc., for [[territory (animal)|territory]], a niche, for a location of [[resources]], for resources and goods, for mates, for [[:wikt:prestige|prestige]], for [[Recognition (sociology)|recognition]], for [[award]]s, for group or social status, or for [[leadership]]. Competition is the opposite of [[cooperation]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sociologyguide.com/basic-concepts/Competition.php Competition], Sociology guide&lt;/ref&gt; It arises whenever at least two parties strive for a goal which cannot be shared or which is desired individually but not in sharing and cooperation. Competition occurs [[nature|naturally]] between living organisms which co-exist in the same [[Natural environment|environment]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Keddy, P.A 2001&quot;&gt;Keddy, P.A. 2001.

''Competition'', 2nd ed., Kluwer, Dordrecht. 552 p.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, animals compete over water supplies, food, mates, and other [[biological resources]]. Humans usually compete for food and mates, though when these needs are met deep rivalries often arise over the pursuit of [[wealth]], prestige, and [[celebrity|fame]]. Competition is also a major tenet of [[market economies]] and business is often associated with competition as most companies are in competition with at least one other firm over the same group of customers, and also competition inside a company is usually stimulated for meeting and reaching higher quality of services or products that the company produce or develop.

== Consequences ==
Competition can have both beneficial and detrimental effects. Many evolutionary biologists view inter-species and intra-species competition as the driving force of [[adaptation]], and ultimately of [[evolution]]. However, some biologists disagree, citing competition as a driving force only on a small scale, and citing the larger scale drivers of evolution to be abiotic factors (termed 'Room to Roam').&lt;ref name=&quot;SahneyBentonFerry2010&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://rsbl.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/6/4/544.full.pdf+html | author=Sahney, S., Benton, M.J. and Ferry, P.A. | year=2010 | title=Links between global taxonomic diversity, ecological diversity and the expansion of vertebrates on land | journal=Biology Letters | doi=10.1098/rsbl.2009.1024 | volume = 6 | pages = 544–547 |format=PDF | issue=4 | pmid=20106856 | pmc=2936204}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Richard Dawkins]], prefers to think of evolution in terms of competition between single genes, which have the welfare of the organism 'in mind' only insofar as that welfare furthers their own selfish drives for replication (termed the 'selfish gene').

Some [[social darwinist]]s claim that competition also serves as a mechanism for determining the best-suited group; politically, economically and ecologically. Positively, competition may serve as a form of [[recreation]] or a challenge provided that it is non-hostile. On the negative side, competition can cause injury and loss to the organisms involved, and drain valuable resources and energy. In the human species competition can be expensive on many levels, not only in lives lost to war, physical injuries, and damaged psychological well beings, but also in the health effects from everyday civilian life caused by work stress, long work hours, abusive working relationships, and poor working conditions, that detract from the enjoyment of life, even as such competition results in financial gain for the owners.

== Biology and ecology ==
&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Natural selection]] --&gt;
{{Main|Competition (biology)}}
Competition within, between, and among species is one of the most important forces in biology, especially in the field of [[ecology]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Keddy, P.A 2001&quot;/&gt;

Competition between members of a species (&quot;intraspecific&quot;) for resources such as [[food]], [[water]], [[Territory (animal)|territory]], and [[sunlight]] may result in an increase in the frequency of a variant of the species best suited for survival and reproduction until its fixation within a population. However, competition among resources also has a strong tendency for diversification between members of the same species, resulting in coexistence of competitive and non-competitive strategies or cycles between low and high [[competitiveness]]. Third parties within a species often favour highly competitive strategies leading to species extinction when environmental conditions are harsh ([[evolutionary suicide]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Baldauf|first1=Sebastian A.|last2=Engqvist|first2=Leif|last3=Weissing|first3=Franz J.|title=Diversifying evolution of competitiveness|journal=Nature Communications|date=29 October 2014|volume=5|pages=5233|doi=10.1038/ncomms6233}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Competition is also present between species (&quot;interspecific&quot;). When resources are limited, several species may depend on these resources. Thus, each of the species competes with the others to gain access to the resources. As a result, species less suited to compete for the resources may [[extinction|die out]] unless they [[adaptation|adapt]] by character dislocation, for instance. According to [[evolutionary theory]], this competition within and between species for resources plays a significant role in [[natural selection]]. At shorter time scales, competition is also one of the most important factors controlling diversity in ecological communities, but at larger scales expansion and contraction of ecological space is a much more larger factor than competition.&lt;ref name=&quot;SahneyBentonFerry2010&quot;/&gt; This is illustrated by living plant communities where asymmetric competition and competitive dominance frequently occur.&lt;ref name=&quot;Keddy, P.A 2001&quot;/&gt;

==Economics and business==
{{Main|Competition (economics)}}

Merriam-Webster defines competition in business as &quot;the effort of two or more parties acting independently to secure the business of a third party by offering the most favorable terms&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://m-w.com/dictionary/competition m-w.com]&lt;/ref&gt;  It was described by [[Adam Smith]] in ''[[The Wealth of Nations]]'' and later economists as allocating productive [[resources]] to their most highly valued uses.&lt;ref&gt;[[George J. Stigler]] ([[The New Palgrave: A Dictionary of Economics|[1987]]] 2008). &quot;competition,&quot; ''[[The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics]]''. [http://www.dictionaryofeconomics.com/article?id=pde2008_C000261&amp;q=competition&amp;topicid=&amp;result_number=6 Abstract.]&lt;/ref&gt; and encouraging [[x-efficiency|efficiency]]. Later [[microeconomic theory]] distinguished between [[perfect competition]] and [[imperfect competition]], concluding that no system of resource allocation is more efficient than [[perfect competition]]. Competition, according to the theory, causes commercial firms to develop new products, services and technologies, which would give consumers greater selection and better products. The greater selection typically causes lower prices for the products, compared to what the price would be if there was no competition ([[monopoly]]) or little competition ([[oligopoly]]).

However, competition may also lead to wasted (duplicated) effort and to increased [[cost]]s (and prices) in some circumstances. For example, the intense competition for the small number of [[Superstar (celebrity)|top jobs in music and movie acting]] leads many aspiring musicians and actors to make substantial investments in training which are not recouped, because only a fraction become successful.  Critics have also argued that competition can be destabilizing, particularly competition between certain financial institutions.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Simkovic, [http://ssrn.com/abstract=1924831 ''Competition and Crisis in Mortgage Securitization'']&lt;/ref&gt;

Experts have also questioned the constructiveness of competition in profitability. It has been argued that competition-oriented objectives are counterproductive to raising revenues and profitability because they limit the options of strategies for firms as well as their ability to offer innovative responses to changes in the market.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://marketing.wharton.upenn.edu/documents/research/CompOrientPDF%2011-27%20%282%29.pdf | title = The Profitability of Winning | author = J. Scott Armstrong and Fred Collopy | journal = Chief Executive | pages = 61–63 | year = 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the strong desire to defeat rival firms with competitive prices has the strong possibility of causing price wars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://qbox.wharton.upenn.edu/documents/mktg/research/Profitability%20of%20winning.pdf | title = Competitor-oriented Objectives: The Myth of Market Share | author = J. Scott Armstrong and Kesten C. Greene | journal = International Journal of Business | volume = 12 | issue = 1 | pages = 116–134 | year = 2007 | issn= 1083-4346}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Three levels of economic competition have been classified:
* The most narrow form is '''direct competition''' (also called category competition or brand competition), where [[product (business)|products]] which perform the same function compete against each other. For example, one brand of pick-up trucks competes with several other brands of pick-up trucks. Sometimes, two companies are rivals and one adds new products to their line, which leads to the other company distributing the same new things, and in this manner they compete.
* The next form is '''substitute''' or '''indirect competition''', where products which are close substitutes for one another compete. For example, butter competes with margarine, mayonnaise and other various sauces and spreads.
* The broadest form of competition is typically called '''budget competition'''. Included in this category is anything on which the [[consumer]] might want to spend their available [[income|money]]. For example, a family which has $20,000 available may choose to spend it on many different items, which can all be seen as competing with each other for the family's expenditure. This form of competition is also sometimes described as a competition of &quot;share of wallet&quot;.

In addition, companies also compete for [[financing]] on the capital markets (equity or debt) in order to generate the necessary cash for their operations. An [[investor]] typically will consider alternative investment opportunities given his risk profile and not only look at companies just competing on product ('''direct competitors'''). Enlarging the investment universe to include '''indirect competitors''' leads to a broader [[peer universe]] of comparable, indirectly competing companies.

Competition does not necessarily have to be between companies. For example, business writers sometimes refer to '''internal competition'''. This is competition within companies. The idea was first introduced by [[Alfred Sloan]] at [[General Motors Corporation|General Motors]] in the 1920s. Sloan deliberately created areas of overlap between divisions of the company so that each division would be competing with the other divisions. For example, the [[Chevy]] division would compete with the [[Pontiac]] division for some [[market segment]]s. The competing brands by the same company allowed parts to be designed by one division and shared by several divisions, for example parts designed by Chevy would also be used by Pontiac. Also, in 1931, [[Procter &amp; Gamble]] initiated a deliberate system of internal brand-versus-brand rivalry. The company was organized around different [[brand]]s, with each brand allocated resources, including a dedicated group of employees willing to champion the brand. Each brand manager was given responsibility for the success or failure of the brand, and compensated accordingly.

Finally, most businesses also encourage competition between individual employees. An example of this is a contest between sales representatives. The sales representative with the highest sales (or the best improvement in sales) over a period of time would gain benefits from the employer. This is also known as '''intra-brand competition.'''

Shalev and Asbjornsen also found that success (i.e. the saving resulted) of [[reverse auction]]s correlated most closely with competition. The literature widely supported the importance of competition as the primary driver of reverse auctions success.&lt;ref&gt;[http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1727409 papers.ssrn.com]&lt;/ref&gt; Their findings appear to support that argument, as competition correlated strongly with the reverse auction success, as well as with the number of bidders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.scribd.com/doc/39032383/Electronic-Reverse-Auction-and-the-Public-Sector-Factors-of-Success-Moshe-E-Shalev-Stee-Asbjorensen |publisher= Shalev Moshe and Asbjornsen Stee |title=Electronic revers auctions and the public sector – Factors of success |work=Journal of Public Procurement |pages=428–452 |volume=10 |issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It should also be noted that business and economic competition in most [[country|countries]] is often limited or restricted. Competition often is subject to legal restrictions. For example, competition may be legally prohibited, as in the case with a [[government monopoly]] or a [[government-granted monopoly]]. [[Tariffs]], [[subsidies]] or other [[protectionist]] measures may also be instituted by government in order to prevent or reduce competition. Depending on the respective economic policy, pure competition is to a greater or lesser extent regulated by [[competition policy]] and [[competition law]].  Another component of these activities is the discovery process, with instances of higher [[government regulation]]s typically leading to less competitive businesses being launched.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cato.org/pub_display.php?pub_id=884&amp;full=1 Competition, Regulation, and the Market Process: An &quot;Austrian&quot; Perspective, Sept. 30, 1982] by [[Israel M. Kirzner]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Interstate===
{{See also|Race to the bottom}}
Competition between countries is quite subtle to detect, but is quite evident in the [[world economy]]. Countries compete to provide the best possible business environment for [[multinational corporations]]. Such competition is evident by the policies undertaken by these countries to educate the future workforce. For example, East Asian economies such as Singapore, Japan and South Korea tend to emphasize education by allocating a large portion of the budget to this sector, and by implementing programmes such as [[gifted education]].

===Law===
{{Main|Competition law}}
[[File:Usdepartmentofjustice.jpg|thumb|right|The [[United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]] building in [[Washington, D.C.]] is home to the influential [[United States antitrust law|antitrust]] enforcers of U.S. competition laws]]
Competition [[law]], known in the [[United States]] as antitrust law, has three main functions. First it prohibits agreements aimed to restrict free trading between business entities and their customers. For example, a [[cartel]] of sports shops who together fix football jersey prices higher than normal is illegal.&lt;ref&gt;''JJB Sports v OFT [2004] CAT 17''&lt;/ref&gt; Second competition law can ban the existence or abusive behaviour of a firm dominating the market. One case in point could be a software company who through its [[monopoly]] on computer platforms makes consumers use its media player.&lt;ref&gt;in the E.U. side of the saga, see [http://europa.eu.int/jurisp/cgi-bin/gettext.pl?lang=en&amp;num=79958777T1904%20R0201_2&amp;doc=T&amp;ouvert=T&amp;seance=ORD&amp;where=() Case T-201/04] ''Microsoft v. Commission'' Order, 22 December 2004&lt;/ref&gt; Third to preserve competitive markets, the law supervises the [[mergers and acquisitions]] of very large corporations. Competition authorities could for instance require that a large packaging company give plastic bottle [[license]]s to competitors before taking over a major [[Polyethylene terephthalate|PET]] producer.&lt;ref&gt;Case C-12/03 P, Commission v. Tetra Laval&lt;/ref&gt; In this case (as in all three), competition law aims to protect the [[consumer welfare|welfare of consumers]] by ensuring business must compete for its share of the [[market economy]].

In recent decades, competition law has also been sold as good medicine to provide better [[public services]], traditionally funded by [[tax]] payers and administered by [[Democracy|democratically]] accountable [[government]]s. Hence competition law is closely connected with the law on deregulation of access to markets, providing state aids and subsidies, the [[privatisation]] of state-owned assets and the use of independent sector regulators, such as the United Kingdom telecommunications watchdog [[Ofcom]]. Behind the practice lies the theory, which over the last fifty years has been dominated by [[neo-classical economics]]. Markets are seen as the most efficient method of allocating resources, although sometimes [[market failure|they fail]], and regulation becomes necessary to protect the ideal market model. Behind the theory lies the history, reaching back further than the [[Roman Empire]]. The business practices of market traders, [[guilds]] and governments have always been subject to scrutiny and sometimes severe sanctions. Since the twentieth century, competition law has become global. The two largest, most organised and influential systems of competition regulation are [[United States antitrust law]] and [[European Community competition law]]. The respective national authorities, the [[U.S. Department of Justice]] (DOJ) and the [[Federal Trade Commission]] (FTC) in the United States and the [[Directorate-General for Competition (European Commission)|European Commission's Competition Directorate General]] (DGCOMP) have formed international support and enforcement networks. Competition law is growing in importance every day, which warrants for its careful study.

== Trade ==

Competition is also found in [[trade]]. For nations, as well as firms it is important to understand trade dynamics in order to market their goods and services effectively in international markets. [[Balance of trade]] can be considered a crude, but widely used proxy for international [[competitiveness]] across levels: [[country]], [[industry]] or even [[business|firm]]. Research data hints that exporting firms have a higher survival rate and achieve greater employment growth compared with non-exporters.

Using a simple concept to measure heights that firms can climb may help improve execution of strategies. International [[competitiveness]] can be measured on several criteria but few are as flexible and versatile to be applied across levels as [[Competitiveness|Trade Competitiveness Index (TCI)]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://kmomaya.files.wordpress.com/2015/05/ijm_pranusha_bhokray_momaya_export_competitiveness_pre-publication_review.pdf | title = Export Competitiveness of Select Firms from India: Glimpse of Trends and Implications | author = Manthri P., Bhokray K. and Momaya K. S. | journal = Indian Journal of Marketing | volume = 45 | issue = 5 | pages = 7–13 | year = 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Politics ==
Competition is also found in [[politics]]. In [[democracy|democracies]], an [[election]] is a competition for an elected office. In other words, two or more candidates strive and compete against one another to attain a position of power. The winner gains the seat of the elected office for a predefined period of time, towards the end of which another election is usually held to determine the next holder of the office.

In addition, there is inevitable competition inside a government. Because several offices are appointed, potential candidates compete against the others in order to gain the particular office. Departments may also compete for a limited amount of resources, such as for [[budget|funding]]. Finally, where there are [[party systems]], elected leaders of different parties will ultimately compete against the other parties for [[law]]s, [[funding]] and [[political power|power]].

Finally, competition also exists between [[government]]s. Each [[country]] or [[nationality]] struggles for world dominance, power, or [[military]] strength. For example, the [[United States]] competed against the [[Soviet Union]] in the [[Cold War]] for world power, and the two also struggled over the different types of government (in these cases [[representative democracy]] and [[communism]]). The result of this type of competition often leads to worldwide tensions, and may sometimes erupt into [[war]]fare.

== Sports ==
{{Anchor|Competitive sports}}&lt;!-- Previous title. 2013-07-01 --&gt;
[[File:US Olympic Committee Headquarters by David Shankbone.jpg|thumb|The [[USOC]]'s headquarters in [[Colorado Springs, Colorado]]. The [[Olympic Games]] are regarded as the international pinnacle of sports competition.]]
While some [[sport]]s and [[game]]s (such as [[fishing]] or [[hiking]]) have been viewed as primarily recreational, most sports are considered competitive. The majority involve competition between two or more persons (sometimes using [[horse racing|horses]] or [[auto racing|cars]]). For example, in a game of [[basketball]], two teams compete against one another to determine who can score the most points. When there is no set reward for the winning team, many players gain a sense of [[pride]]. In addition, extrinsic rewards may also be given. Athletes, besides competing against other humans, also compete against [[nature]] in sports such as [[whitewater kayaking]] or [[mountaineering]], where the goal is to reach a destination, with only natural barriers impeding the process. A regularly scheduled (for instance annual) competition meant to determine the &quot;best&quot; competitor of that cycle is called a [[championship]].
[[File:Citi Field Day.jpg|thumb|left|[[Baseball]], a competitive sport]]
Competitive sports are governed by codified rules agreed upon by the participants. Violating these rules is considered to be [[unfair competition]]. Thus, sports provide artificial (not natural) competition; for example, competing for control of a ball, or defending territory on a playing field is not an innate biological factor in humans. Athletes in sports such as [[gymnastics]] and competitive [[diving]] compete against each other in order to come closest to a conceptual ideal of a perfect performance, which incorporates measurable criteria and standards which are translated into numerical ratings and scores by appointed judges.

Sports competition is generally broken down into three categories: '''individual''' sports, such as [[archery]]; '''dual''' sports, such as [[tennis|doubles tennis]], and '''team''' sports competition, such as [[cricket]] or [[football]]. While most sports competitions are recreation, there exist several [[major]] and [[minor league|minor]] professional sports leagues throughout the world. The [[Olympic Games]], held every four years, is usually regarded as the international pinnacle of sports competition.

== Education ==
Competition is a major factor in education. On a global scale, national education systems, intending to bring out the best in the next generation, encourage competitiveness among students through [[scholarships]]. Countries such as England and Singapore have [[special education]] programmes which cater for specialist students, prompting charges of [[academic elitism]]. Upon receipt of their academic results, students tend to compare their grades to see who is better. In severe cases, the pressure to perform in some countries is so high that it can result in stigmatization of intellectually deficient students, or even suicide as a consequence of failing the exams; Japan being a prime example (see [[Education in Japan]]). This has resulted in critical re-evaluation of examinations as a whole by educationalists {{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}. Critics of competition as a motivating factor in education systems, such as [[Alfie Kohn]], assert that competition actually has a net negative influence on the achievement levels of students, and that it &quot;turns all of us into losers&quot; (Kohn 1986). Economist [[Richard Layard]] has commented on the harmful effects, stating &quot;people feel that they are under a great deal of pressure. They feel that their main objective in life is to do better than other
people. That is certainly what young people are being taught in school every day. And it's not a good basis for a society.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-13052639 ''Group dedicated to happiness launched in UK'', BBC video, April 12, 2011]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Literature ==
Literary competitions, such as contests sponsored by [[literary journals]], publishing houses and theaters, have increasingly become a means for aspiring writers to gain recognition. Awards for fiction include those sponsored by the ''[[Missouri Review]]'', ''[[Boston Review]]'', ''[[Indiana Review]]'', ''[[North American Review]]'' and ''[[Southwest Review]]''. The [[Edward Albee|Albee]] Award, sponsored by the Yale Drama Series, is among the most prestigious playwriting awards.{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}}

== Games of luck ==
In Australia, New Zealand and the United Kingdom, competitions or lottos are the equivalent of what are commonly known as [[sweepstakes]] in the United States. The correct technical name for Australian consumer competitions is a trade promotion lottery or lottos.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.olgr.nsw.gov.au/promos_trade_promos.asp |title=OLGR &gt; Promotions and competitions &gt; Trade promotion lotteries |publisher=Olgr.nsw.gov.au |date= |accessdate=2013-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Competition or trade promotion lottery entrants enter to win a prize or prizes, hence many entrants are all in competition, or competing for a limited number of prizes.

A trade promotion lottery or competition is a free entry lottery run to promote goods or services supplied by a business. An example is where you purchase goods or services and then given the chance to enter into the lottery and possibly win a prize. A trade promotion lottery can be called a lotto, competition, contest, sweepstake, or giveaway.

People that enjoy entering competitions are known as compers. Many compers attend annual national conventions. In 2012 over 100 people from around Australia met on the Gold Coast, Queensland to discuss competitions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lottos.com.au/competitions/viewthreadlite.php?tid=275933 |title=NATIONAL LOTTOS MEET GOLD COAST 16TH SEPTEMBER 2012 :) |publisher=Lottos.com.au |date= |accessdate=2013-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aca.ninemsn.com.au/article.aspx?id=8536705 |title=Comp Queens |publisher=Aca.ninemsn.com.au |date=2012-09-21 |accessdate=2013-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Study==
Competition has been studied in several fields, including [[psychology]], [[sociology]] and [[anthropology]]. Social [[psychologist]]s, for instance, study the nature of competition. They investigate the natural urge of competition and its circumstances. They also study [[group dynamics]], to detect how competition emerges and what its effects are. [[Sociologist]]s, meanwhile, study the effects of competition on society as a whole. In addition, [[anthropologist]]s study the history and prehistory of competition in various cultures. They also investigate how competition manifested itself in various [[culture|cultural]] settings in the past, and how competition has developed over time.

==Competitiveness==
{{Main|Competitiveness}}
Many [[philosopher]]s and [[psychologist]]s have identified a trait in most living organisms which can drive the particular organism to compete. This trait, called competitiveness, is viewed as an innate [[biology|biological]] [[Trait (biological)|trait]] which coexists along with the urge for survival. Competitiveness, or the inclination to compete, though, has become synonymous with aggressiveness and ambition in the [[English language]]. More advanced [[civilization]]s integrate aggressiveness and competitiveness into their [[Social interaction|interactions]], as a way to distribute resources and adapt. Many plants compete with neighboring ones for sunlight.

However, [[Stephen Jay Gould]] and others have argued that as one ascends the evolutionary hierarchy, competitiveness (the survival instinct) becomes less innate, and more a learned behavior.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}} The same could be said for co-operation: in humans, at least, both co-operation and competition are considered learned behaviors{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}, because the human species learns to adapt to environmental pressures. Consequently, if survival requires competitive behaviors, the individual will compete, and if survival requires co-operative behaviors, the individual will co-operate. In the case of humans, therefore, aggressiveness may be an innate characteristic, but a person need not be competitive at the same time, for instance when scaling a cliff. On the other hand, humans seem also to have a nurturing instinct, to protect newborns and the weak. While that does not necessitate co-operative behavior, it does help.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}

The term also applies to [[econometrics]]. Here, it is a comparative measure of the ability and performance of a firm or sub-sector to sell and produce/supply goods and/or services in a given market. The two academic bodies of thought on the assessment of competitiveness are the '''Structure Conduct Performance Paradigm''' and the more contemporary '''New Empirical Industrial Organisation''' model. Predicting changes in the competitiveness of business sectors is becoming an integral and explicit step in public policymaking. Within capitalist economic systems, the drive of enterprises is to maintain and improve their own competitiveness.

=== Hypercompetitiveness ===
The tendency toward extreme, unhealthy competition has been termed '''hypercompetitiveness'''. This concept originated in [[Karen Horney]]'s theories on [[neurosis]]; specifically, the highly aggressive personality type which is characterized as &quot;moving against people&quot;. In her view, some people have a need to compete and win at all costs as a means of maintaining their [[self-esteem|self-worth]]. These individuals are likely to turn any activity into a competition, and they will feel threatened if they find themselves losing. Researchers have found that men and women who score high on the trait of hypercompetitiveness are more [[Narcissism|narcissistic]] and less psychologically healthy than those who score low on the trait.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Ryckman, R. M., Thornton, B., Butler, J. C. |year=1994 |title= Personality correlates of the hypercompetitive attitude scale: Validity tests of Horney's theory of neurosis |work=[[Journal of Personality Assessment]] |volume=62 |pages=84–94 |url=http://www.leaonline.com/doi/abs/10.1207/s15327752jpa6201_8?cookieSet=1&amp;journalCode=jpa |doi=10.1207/s15327752jpa6201+8}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Hypercompetitive individuals generally believe that &quot;[[winning isn't everything; it's the only thing]]&quot;.{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}}

It promotes a &quot;climate of competitive egoism and individualism&quot;, with competition for jobs and competition between employees; Marx said competition between workers exceeds that demonstrated by company owners.&lt;ref name=&quot;allenb&quot;&gt;
Allen E. Buchanan, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=j1AOAAAAQAAJ&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;hl=bg&amp;pg=PP1#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Marx and justice: the radical critique of liberalism]'', [[Taylor &amp; Francis]], 1982
&lt;/ref&gt; He also points out that competition separates individuals from one another and while concentration of workers and development of better communication alleviate this, they are not a decision.&lt;ref name=&quot;allenb&quot;/&gt;

===Freud===
[[Sigmund Freud]] explained competition as a primal dilemma in which all infants find themselves. The infant competes with other family members for the attention and affection of the parent of the opposite sex or the primary caregiving parent. During this time, a boy develops a deep fear that the father (the son's prime rival) will punish him for these feelings of desire for the mother, by castrating  him. Girls develop penis envy towards all males. The girl’s envy is rooted in the biologic fact that, without a penis, she cannot sexually possess mother, as the infantile id demands, resultantly, the girl redirects her desire for sexual union upon father in competitive rivalry with her mother. This constellation of feelings is known as [[Oedipus Complex]] ( after the Greek Mythology figure who accidentally killed his father and married his mother). This is associated with the [[phallic stage]] of childhood development where intense primal emotions of competitive rivalry with (usually) the parent of the same sex are rampant and create a crisis that must be negotiated successfully for healthy psychological development to proceed. Unresolved Oedipus complex competitiveness issues can lead to lifelong neuroses manifesting in various ways related to an overdetermined relationship to competition.

===Gandhi===
[[Mahatma Gandhi|Gandhi]] speaks of egoistic competition.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gandhi&quot;&gt;
Parmeshwari Dayal, [https://books.google.com/books?id=FemHmw5fGQUC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;hl=bg&amp;pg=PP1#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Gandhian Theory of Social Reconstruction], Atlantic Publishers &amp; Dist, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; For him, such qualities glorified and/or left unbridled, can lead to violence, conflict, discord and destructiveness. For Gandhi, competition comes from the ego, and therefore society must be based on mutual love, cooperation and sacrifice for the well-being of humanity.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gandhi&quot;/&gt; In the society desired by Gandhi, each individual will cooperate and serve for the welfare of others and people will share each other's joys, sorrows and achievements as a norm of a social life. For him, in a non-violent society, competition does not have a place and this should become realized with more people making the personal choice to have fewer tendencies toward egoism and selfishness.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gandhi&quot;/&gt;

'''Valentine's Day''', also called '''Saint Valentine's Day'''  or the '''Feast of Saint Valentine''',&lt;ref&gt;Chambers 21st Century Dictionary, Revised ed., Allied Publishers, 2005 ISBN 9780550142108&lt;/ref&gt; is an annual [[holiday]] celebrated on February 14. It originated as a [[Western Christianity|Western]] [[Christianity|Christian]] [[Christian liturgy|liturgical]] feast day honoring one or more early [[saint]]s named ''[[Saint Valentine|Valentinus]]'', and is recognized as a significant cultural and commercial celebration in many regions around the world, although it is not a [[public holiday]] in any country.

Several [[Christian martyr|martyrdom]] stories associated with the various Valentines that were connected to February 14 were added to later [[Martyrology|martyrologies]],&lt;ref&gt;Ansgar, 1986, ''Chaucer and the Cult of Saint valentine'', pp. 46-58&lt;/ref&gt; including a popular [[hagiographical]] account of Saint Valentine of [[Rome]] which indicated he was imprisoned for performing weddings for soldiers who were forbidden to marry and for ministering to Christians, who were [[Persecution of Christians in the Roman Empire|persecuted under the Roman Empire]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Cooper2013&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Cooper|first=J.C.|title=Dictionary of Christianity|date=23 October 2013|publisher=Routledge|language=English |isbn=9781134265466|page=278|quote=Valentine, St (d. c. 270, f.d. 14 February).

His day is 14 February, as is that of St Valentine, bishop of Terni, who was martyred a few years later in 273.}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Legendary material in Christian hagiography|legend]], during his imprisonment, Saint Valentine healed the daughter of his jailer, Asterius,&lt;ref name=&quot;Ball1993&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Ball|first=Ann|title=A Litany of Saints|date=1 January 1992|publisher=[[Our Sunday Visitor|OSV]]|language=English|isbn=9780879734602|quote=While in prison, he restored sight to the little blind daughter of his judge, Asterius, who thereupon was converted with all his family and suffered martyrdom with the saint.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and before his execution, he wrote her a letter signed &quot;Your Valentine&quot; as a farewell.&lt;ref name=&quot;Guiley2001&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Guiley|first=Rosemary|title=The Encyclopedia of Saints|year=2001|publisher=[[Infobase Publishing]]|language=English |isbn=9781438130262|page=341|quote=On the morning of his execution, he supposedly sent a farewell message to the jailer's daughter, signed “from your Valentine.” His body was buried on the Flaminian Way in Rome, and his relics were taken to the church of St. Praxedes.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The day first became associated with [[Romance (love)|romantic love]] within the circle of [[Geoffrey Chaucer]] in the 14th century, when the tradition of [[courtly love]] flourished. In 18th-century England, it evolved into an occasion in which [[intimate relationship|lovers]] expressed their love for each other by presenting flowers, offering [[confectionery]], and sending [[greeting card]]s (known as &quot;''valentines''&quot;).  In Europe, [[Saint Valentine's Key]]s are given to lovers &quot;as a romantic symbol and an invitation to unlock the giver’s heart&quot;, as well as to children, in order to ward off [[epilepsy]] (called Saint Valentine's Malady).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.prm.ox.ac.uk/amulets/index.php/keys-amulet2/index.html|title=St Valentine Key, Italy|year=2012|work=[[Pitt Rivers Museum]]|publisher=[[University of Oxford]]|accessdate=June 20, 2014|quote=While Saint Valentine’s keys are traditionally gifted as a romantic symbol and an invitation to unlock the giver’s heart, Saint Valentine is also a patron saint of epilepsy. The belief that he could perform miraculous cures and heal the condition – also known as ‘Saint Valentine’s illness’ or ‘Saint Valentine’s affliction’ – was once common in southern Germany, eastern Switzerland, Austria, and northern Italy. To this day, a special ceremony where children are given small golden keys to ward off epilepsy is held at the Oratorio di San Giorgio, a small chapel in Monselice, Padua, on 14 February each year.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Valentine's Day symbols that are used today include the [[heart (symbol)|heart-shaped]] outline, doves, and the figure of the winged [[Cupid]]. Since the 19th century, handwritten valentines have given way to mass-produced greeting cards.&lt;ref name=&quot;Leigh Eric Schmidt 1993 pp. 209–245&quot;&gt;Leigh Eric Schmidt, &quot;The Fashioning of a Modern Holiday: St. Valentine's Day, 1840–1870&quot; ''Winterthur Portfolio'' '''28'''.4 (Winter 1993), pp. 209–245.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Historical facts===
[[File:St-valentine 110921-01.jpg|thumb|Shrine of St. Valentine in Whitefriar Street Carmelite Church in Dublin, Ireland]]

Numerous early [[Christian]] martyrs were named [[Saint Valentine|Valentine]].&lt;ref&gt;Henry Ansgar Kelly, in ''Chaucer and the Cult of Saint Valentine'' (Leiden: Brill) 1986, accounts for these and further local Saints Valentine (Ch. 6 &quot;The Genoese Saint Valentine and the observances of May&quot;) in arguing that Chaucer had an established tradition in mind, and (pp. 79 ff.) linking the Valentine in question to Valentine, first bishop of Genoa, the only Saint Valentine honoured with a feast in springtime, the season indicated by Chaucer. Valentine of Genoa was treated by [[Jacobus de Voragine|Jacobus of Verazze]] in his ''Chronicle of Genoa'' (Kelly p. 85).&lt;/ref&gt; The Valentines honored on February 14 are Valentine of Rome (''Valentinus presb. m. Romae'') and Valentine of Terni (''Valentinus ep. Interamnensis m. Romae'').&lt;ref&gt;''Oxford Dictionary of Saints'', ''s.v.'' &quot;Valentine&quot;: &quot;The [[Acta Sanctorum|Acts]] of both are unreliable, and the Bollandists assert that these two Valentines were in fact one and the same.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Valentine of Rome was a priest in Rome who was martyred in 269 and was added to the calendar of saints by Pope Galesius in 496 and was buried on the [[Via Flaminia]]. The relics of Saint Valentine were kept in the [[Catacombs of San Valentino|Church and Catacombs of San Valentino]] in Rome, which &quot;remained an important pilgrim site throughout the Middle Ages until the relics of St. Valentine were transferred to the church of [[Santa Prassede]] during the pontificate of [[Pope Nicholas IV|Nicholas IV]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Matilda Webb 2001&quot;&gt;Matilda Webb, The Churches and Catacombs of Early Christian Rome, 2001, Sussex Academic Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.novareinna.com/festive/saintval.html |publisher=novareinna.com |title=Saint Valentine's Day: Legend of the Saint}}&lt;/ref&gt; The flower-crowned skull of Saint Valentine is exhibited in the Basilica of [[Santa Maria in Cosmedin]], Rome. Other relics are found at [[Whitefriar Street Carmelite Church]] in Dublin, Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Meera|first=Lester|title=Sacred Travels|year=2011|publisher=Adams Media|isbn=1440525463|page=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Valentine of Terni became bishop of Interamna (modern [[Terni]]) and is said to have been martyred during the persecution under Emperor [[Aurelian]] in 273. He is buried on the Via Flaminia, but in a different location from Valentine of Rome. His relics are at the Basilica of Saint Valentine in Terni (''Basilica di San Valentino''). Jack B. Oruch states that &quot;abstracts of the acts of the two saints were in nearly every church and monastery of Europe.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Alison Chapman. Patrons and Patron Saints in Early Modern English Literature. Routledge. pg. 122.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Catholic Encyclopedia]]'' also speaks of a third saint named Valentine who was mentioned in early [[martyrology|martyrologies]] under date of February 14. He was martyred in Africa with a number of companions, but nothing more is known about him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15254a.htm |publisher=newadvent.org |title=Catholic Encyclopedia: St. Valentine}}&lt;/ref&gt; Saint Valentine's&lt;!--which one?--&gt; head was preserved in the abbey of [[New Minster, Winchester]], and venerated.&lt;ref name=&quot;ansgar&quot;/&gt;

February 14 is celebrated as St. Valentine's Day in various [[Christian denomination]]s; it has, for example, the rank of 'commemoration' in the [[Calendar of saints (Church of England)|calendar of saints]] in the [[Anglican Communion]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Anglican&quot;/&gt; In addition, the [[feast day]] of Saint Valentine is also given in the [[Calendar of Saints (Lutheran)|calendar of saints]] of the [[Lutheran Church]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Pfatteicher2008&quot;/&gt; However, in the 1969 revision of the [[Roman Catholic Calendar of Saints]], the [[Calendar of Saints|feast day]] of Saint Valentine on February 14 was [[Mysterii Paschalis|removed]] from the [[General Roman Calendar]] and relegated to particular (local or even national) calendars for the following reason: &quot;Though the memorial of Saint Valentine is ancient, it is left to particular calendars, since, apart from his name, nothing is known of Saint Valentine except that he was buried on the Via Flaminia on February 14.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''Calendarium Romanum ex Decreto Sacrosancti Œcumenici Concilii Vaticani II Instauratum Auctoritate Pauli PP. VI Promulgatum'' (Typis Polyglottis Vaticanis, MCMLXIX), p. 117.&lt;/ref&gt;

The feast day is still celebrated in [[Balzan]] ([[Malta]]) where relics of the saint are claimed to be found, and also throughout the world by [[Traditionalist Catholics]] who follow the older, pre-[[Second Vatican Council]] calendar. In the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]], St. Valentine's Day is celebrated on [[July 6 (Eastern Orthodox liturgics)|July 6]], in which [[Saint Valentine]], the Roman presbyter, is honoured; furthermore, the Eastern Orthodox Church observes the feast of Hieromartyr Valentine, Bishop of Interamna, on [[July 30 (Eastern Orthodox liturgics)|July 30]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pravmir.com/st-valentines-day-legend-and-reality/|title=St. Valentine|work=pravmir.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stmarina.org/valentine.html Coptic Orthodox Church – From Where Valentine's Day Comes From] {{wayback|url=http://www.stmarina.org/valentine.html |date=20100525101359 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.happy-valentines-day-2014.com/2014/01/valentines-day-history-myths.html |title= Happy Valentine’s Day History And Myths Behind It}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Legends ===
[[File:St-valentine-baptizing-st-lucilla-jacopo-bassano.jpg|thumb|left|St Valentine baptizing St Lucilla, Jacopo Bassano]]
J.C. Cooper, in ''The Dictionary of Christianity'', writes that Saint Valentine was &quot;a priest of Rome who was imprisoned for succouring persecuted Christians.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;JC Cooper 2013&quot;&gt;J.C. Cooper, Dictionary of Christianity, 2013, Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt; Contemporary records of Saint Valentine were most probably destroyed during this [[Diocletianic Persecution]] in the early 4th century.&lt;ref name=&quot;oruch&quot;/&gt; In the 5th or 6th century, a work called ''Passio Marii et Marthae'' published a story of martyrdom for Saint Valentine of Rome, perhaps by borrowing tortures that happened to other saints, as was usual in the literature of that period. The same events are also found in ''[[Bede|Bede's Martyrology]]'', which was compiled in the 8th century.&lt;ref name=&quot;oruch&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ansgar49&quot;&gt;Ansgar, 1986, pp. 49–50&lt;/ref&gt;  It states that Saint Valentine was persecuted as a [[Christian]] and interrogated by [[Roman Emperor]] [[Claudius Gothicus|Claudius II]] in person. Claudius was impressed by Valentine and had a discussion with him, attempting to get him to convert to Roman [[paganism]] in order to save his life. Valentine refused and tried to convert Claudius to Christianity instead. Because of this, he was executed. Before his execution, he is reported to have performed a miracle by healing Julia, the blind daughter of his jailer Asterius. The jailer's daughter and his forty-four member [[household]] (family members and servants) came to believe in [[Jesus]] and were [[baptized]].&lt;ref name=&quot;oruch&quot;/&gt;

A later ''Passio'' repeated the legend, adding that [[Pope Julius I]] built a church over his sepulchre (it is a confusion with a 4th-century tribune called Valentino who donated land to build a church at a time when Julius was a Pope).&lt;ref name=&quot;ansgar49&quot;/&gt; The legend was picked up as fact by later martyrologies, starting by [[Bede]]'s martyrology in the 8th century.&lt;ref name=&quot;ansgar49&quot;/&gt; It was repeated in the 13th century, in ''[[Legenda Aurea]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.catholic-forum.com/saints/golden169.htm ''Legenda Aurea'', &quot;Saint Valentine&quot;], catholic-forum.com.&lt;/ref&gt;

There is an additional embellishment to ''The Golden Legend'', which according to Henry Ansgar Kelly, was added centuries later, and widely repeated.&lt;ref name=&quot;your valentine&quot;&gt;Ansgar, 1986, p. 59. It originated in the 1797 edition of ''Kemmish's Annual'', according to Frank Staff, ''The Valentine and Its Origins'' (London, 1969), p. 122. Ansgar was unable to corroborate this.&lt;/ref&gt; On the evening before Valentine was to be [[executed]], he is supposed to have written the first &quot;valentine&quot; card himself, addressed to the daughter of his jailer Asterius, who was no longer blind, signing as &quot;Your Valentine.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;your valentine&quot;/&gt; The expression &quot;From your Valentine&quot; was later adopted by modern Valentine letters.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ruth Lee 1952&quot;&gt;Ruth Webb Lee, A History of Valentines, 1952, Studio Publications in association with Crowell.&lt;/ref&gt; This legend has been published by both [[American Greetings]] and [[The History Channel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/st-valentine-beheaded|title=St. Valentine beheaded - Feb 14, 278|date=14 February 2012|publisher=[[History (TV channel)|History]]|accessdate=9 April 2015|quote=When Valentine’s actions were discovered, Claudius ordered that he be put to death. Valentine was arrested and dragged before the Prefect of Rome, who condemned him to be beaten to death with clubs and to have his head cut off. The sentence was carried out on February 14, on or about the year 270. Legend also has it that while in jail, St. Valentine left a farewell note for the jailer’s daughter, who had become his friend, and signed it “From Your Valentine.”}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Valentineanddisciples.jpg|thumb|[[Saint Valentine|Saint Valentine of Terni]] and his disciples]]
[[John Foxe]], an English historian, as well as the [[Order of Carmelites]], state that Saint Valentine was buried in the [[Santa Prassede|Church of Praxedes]] in Rome, located near the cemetery of [[Saint Hippolytus]]. This order says that according to legend, &quot;Julia herself planted a pink-blossomed almond tree near his grave. Today, the almond tree remains a symbol of abiding love and friendship.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;John Foxe. Voices of the Martyrs. Bridge Logos Foundation. pg. 62.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.carmelites.ie/ireland/whitefriar%20st/valentine.htm  Shrine of St Valentine, Whitefriar Street Church]&lt;/ref&gt;

Another embellishment suggests that Saint Valentine performed clandestine [[Christian views on marriage|Christian weddings]] for soldiers who were forbidden to marry.&lt;ref name=&quot;David Harkness 1961&quot;&gt;David James Harkness, Legends and Lore: Southerns Indians Flowers Holidays, vol. XL, No. 2, April 1961, University of Tennessee Newsletter (bimonthly), p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt; The Roman Emperor Claudius II supposedly forbade this in order to grow his army, believing that married men did not make for good soldiers.&lt;ref name=&quot;David Harkness 1961&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Max Christensen 1997&quot;&gt;Max L. Christensen, Heroes and Saints: More Stories of People Who Made a Difference, 1997, Westminster John Knox Press. Chapter &quot;The First Valentine&quot;, p. 25 ISBN 066425702X&lt;/ref&gt; However, this supposed marriage ban was never issued, and in fact Claudius II told his soldiers to take two or three women for themselves after his victory over the [[Goths]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Monger2013&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=George Monger|title=Marriage Customs of the World: An Encyclopedia of Dating Customs and Wedding Traditions, Expanded Second Edition &amp;#91;2 Volumes&amp;#93;|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=avDXAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA665|date=April 9, 2013|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-1-59884-664-5|pages=665–671}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to legend, in order &quot;to remind these men of their vows and God’s love, Saint Valentine is said to have cut hearts from parchment&quot;, giving them to these soldiers and [[Persecution of Christians in the Roman Empire|persecuted Christians]], a possible origin of the widespread use of hearts on St. Valentine's Day.&lt;ref name=&quot;Frank Staff 1969&quot;&gt;Frank Staff, The Valentine &amp; Its Origins, 1969, Frederick A. Praeger.&lt;/ref&gt;

Saint Valentine supposedly wore a purple [[amethyst]] ring, customarily worn on the hands of Christian [[bishop]]s with an image of [[Cupid]] engraved in it, a recognizable symbol associated with love that was legal under the Roman Empire;&lt;ref name=&quot;Max Christensen 1997&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;AMNH 1958&quot;&gt;The Illustrated Library of the Natural Sciences, Volume 1, 1958, Simon and Schuster. p. 85 &quot;The amethyst is the birthstone for February, and Saint Valentine is supposed to have worn an amethyst engraved with a figure of Cupid&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Roman soldiers would recognize the ring and ask him to perform marriage for them.&lt;ref name=&quot;Max Christensen 1997&quot;/&gt; Probably due to the association with Saint Valentine, amethyst has become the [[birthstone]] of February, which is thought to attract love.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hesse2007&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Rayner W.

==Folk traditions==
While the European folk traditions connected with Saint Valentine and St. Valentine's Day have become marginalized by the modern Anglo-American customs connecting the day with [[romantic love]], there are some remaining associations connecting the saint with the advent of [[Spring (season)|spring]].{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}

While the custom of sending cards, flowers, chocolates and other gifts originated in the UK, Valentine's Day still remains connected with  various regional customs in England. In [[Norfolk]], a character called 'Jack' Valentine knocks on the rear door of houses leaving sweets and presents for children. Although he was leaving treats, many children were scared of this mystical person.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.information-britain.co.uk/customdetail.php?id=45|title=British Folk Customs, Jack Valentine, Norfolk|work=information-britain.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.visitnorwich.co.uk/valentines-romantic-norfolk.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Slovenia]], Saint Valentine or Zdravko was one of the saints of spring, the saint of good health and the patron of [[beekeepers]] and pilgrims.&lt;ref name=&quot;GG2008-02-15&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.gorenjskiglas.si/novice/gg_plus/index.php?action=clanek&amp;id=17462 |title=Sv.

A proverb says that &quot;Saint Valentine brings the keys of roots&quot;. Plants and flowers start to grow on this day. It has been celebrated as the day when the first work in the vineyards and in the fields commences. It is also said that birds propose to each other or marry on that day. Another proverb says ''&quot;Valentin – prvi spomladin&quot;'' (&quot;Valentine — the first spring saint&quot;), as in some places (especially [[White Carniola]]), Saint Valentine marks the beginning of spring.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://dnevnik.si/novice/prosti_cas/1042422995 |title=Vreme kot nalašč za izlete |language=Slovenian |trans_title=Weather As On Purpose for Trips |date=February 9, 2011 |newspaper=Dnevnik.si}}&lt;/ref&gt; Valentine's Day has only recently been celebrated as the day of love. The day of love was traditionally March 12, the [[Saint Gregory]]'s day, or February 22, [[Vincent of Saragossa|Saint Vincent's Day]]. The patron of love was [[Anthony of Padua|Saint Anthony]], whose day has been celebrated on June 13.&lt;ref name=&quot;GG2008-02-15&quot; /&gt;

== Connection with romantic love ==

=== Lupercalia ===
{{Main|Lupercalia}}
There is no evidence of any link between St. Valentine's Day and the rites of the ancient Roman festival, despite many claims by many authors.&lt;ref name=&quot;ansgar&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title= Secreted Desires: The Major Uranians: Hopkins, Pater and Wilde |author= Michael Matthew Kaylor |publisher= [[Masaryk University]] Press |year= 2006 |isbn= 80-210-4126-9 |edition= electronic |page= footnote 2 in page 235 |url= https://books.google.com/?id=-Wa7SIsAQgAC&amp;pg=PA235&amp;dq=saint+valentine's+day+lupercalia#v=onepage&amp;q=saint%20valentine's%20day%20lupercalia&amp;f=false |postscript= &lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter.

Popular modern sources claim links to unspecified Greco-Roman February holidays alleged to be devoted to fertility and love to St. Valentine's Day, but prior to [[Chaucer]] in the 14th century, there were no links between the Saints named Valentinus and romantic love.&lt;ref name=&quot;oruch&quot;/&gt; Earlier links as described above were focused on ''sacrifice'' rather than romantic love. In the [[Attic calendar|ancient Athenian calendar]] the period between mid-January and mid-February was the month of [[Greek calendar|Gamelion]], dedicated to the sacred marriage of [[Zeus]] and [[Hera]].{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}

In [[Ancient Rome]], [[Lupercalia]], observed February 13–15, was an archaic rite connected to fertility. Lupercalia was a festival local to the city of Rome. The more general Festival of [[Juno Februa]], meaning &quot;Juno the purifier&quot; or &quot;the chaste Juno&quot;, was celebrated on February 13–14. Pope [[Gelasius I]] (492–496) abolished Lupercalia. Some researchers have theorized that Gelasius I replaced Lupercalia with the celebration of the Purification of Mary in February 14 and claim a connection to the 14th century's connotations of romantic love, but there is no historical indication that he ever intended such a thing.&lt;ref group=&quot;notes&quot;&gt;Ansgar, 1976, pp. 60–61. The replacement of Lupercalia with Saint Valentine's celebration was suggested by researchers Kellog and Cox. Ansgar says &quot;It is hardly credible, then, that Pope Gelasius could have introduced the feast of the Purification to counteract the Lupercalia, and in fact the historical records of his pontificate give no hint of such an action.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;oruch lupercalia&quot;&gt;Jack B. Oruch, &quot;St. Valentine, Chaucer, and Spring in February&quot; ''Speculum'' '''56'''.3 (July 1981:534–565)&lt;/ref&gt; Also, the dates don't fit because at the time of Gelasius I the feast was only celebrated in Jerusalem, and it was on February 14 only because Jerusalem placed the Nativity on January 6.&lt;ref group=&quot;notes&quot;&gt;Ansgar, 1976, pp. 60–61. This feast is celebrated 40 days after the Nativity. In Jerusalem the Nativity was celebrated on January 6, and this feast in February 14. But, in the West and even in Eastern places such as Antioch and Alexandria, Nativity was celebrated on December 25, and this Purification was not celebrated. When this feast was introduced to Rome, it was directly placed in February 2. Around that time, Jerusalem adopted the Nativity date of December 25 and moved the Purification to February 2.&lt;/ref&gt; Although it was called &quot;Purification of Mary&quot;, it dealt mainly with the presentation of Jesus at the temple.&lt;ref name=&quot;auto&quot;&gt;Ansgar, 1976, pp. 60–61.&lt;/ref&gt; The Jerusalem's Purification of Mary on February 14 became the [[Presentation of Jesus at the Temple]] on February 2 as it was introduced to Rome and other places in the sixth century, after Gelasius I's time.&lt;ref name=&quot;auto&quot;/&gt;&lt;!--Candlemas is treated elsehere; here it is a confusing extraneity: Some historians argue that [[Candlemas]] (then held on February 14, later moved to February 2) was promoted as its replacement, but this feast was already being celebrated in [[Jerusalem]] by AD 381.--&gt;&lt;!--the date was established in the martyrologies:&quot;The pope also declared in 500 that the feast of [[St. Valentine]] would be on February 15.&quot;--&gt;

[[Alban Butler]] in his ''Lifes of the Principal Saints'' (1756–1759) claimed without proof that men and women in Lupercalia drew names from a jar to make couples, and that modern Valentine's letters originated from this custom. In reality, this practice originated in the Middle Ages, with no link to Lupercalia, with men drawing the names of girls at random to couple with them. This custom was combated by priests, for example by [[Frances de Sales]] around 1600, apparently by replacing it with a religious custom of girls drawing the names of apostles from the [[altar]]. However, this religious custom is recorded as soon as the 13th century in the life of Saint [[Elizabeth of Hungary]], so it could have a different origin.&lt;ref name=&quot;ansgar&quot;&gt;Ansgar, 1986, pp. [https://books.google.com/books?id=_bqdZbKPztMC&amp;pg=PA60&amp;dq=saint+valentine's+lupercalia+year&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=uXI4T8CgLITX0QWB4OiSAg&amp;ved=0CDYQ6AEwATgK#v=onepage&amp;q=saint%20valentine's%20lupercalia%20year&amp;f=false 58–63]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{anchor|Chaucer's love}}

=== Chaucer's love birds ===
Jack B. Oruch writes that the first recorded association of Valentine's Day with romantic love is in ''[[Parlement of Foules]]'' (1382) by [[Geoffrey Chaucer]].&lt;ref name=&quot;oruch&quot;&gt;Oruch, Jack B., &quot;[http://www.jstor.org/stable/2847741 St. Valentine, Chaucer, and Spring in February]&quot;, ''Speculum'', '''56''' (1981): 534–65. Oruch's survey of the literature finds no association between Valentine and romance prior to Chaucer. He concludes that Chaucer is likely to be &quot;the original mythmaker in this instance.&quot; [http://colfa.utsa.edu/chaucer/ec23.html Colfa.utsa.edu]&lt;/ref&gt; Chaucer wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;''For this was on seynt Volantynys day''&lt;br /&gt;''Whan euery bryd comyth there to chese his make''.&lt;/blockquote&gt;[&quot;For this was on St. Valentine's Day, when every bird cometh there to choose his mate.&quot;]

This poem was written to honor the first anniversary of the engagement of King [[Richard II of England]] to [[Anne of Bohemia]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ansgar2001&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://spotlight.ucla.edu/faculty/henry-kelly_valentine/|title=Henry Ansgar Kelly, Valentine's Day |author= Meg Sullivan |date= February 1, 2001 |work= UCLA Spotlight}}&lt;/ref&gt; A treaty providing for a marriage was signed on May 2, 1381.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://public.wsu.edu/~delahoyd/chaucer/PF.html |title=Chaucer: The Parliament of Fowls}}, wsu.edu&lt;/ref&gt;

Readers have uncritically assumed that Chaucer was referring to February 14 as Valentine's Day; however, mid-February is an unlikely time for birds to be mating in [[England]]. Henry Ansgar Kelly has observed that Chaucer might have had in mind the feast day of St. Valentine of Genoa, an early [[bishop of Genoa]] who died around AD 307; it was probably celebrated on 3 May.&lt;ref name=&quot;ansgar2001&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kelly, Henry Ansgar, ''Chaucer and the Cult of Saint Valentine'' (Brill Academic Publishers, 1997), ISBN 90-04-07849-5. Chapter 6 The Genoese St. Valentine, p. 80–83.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iol.co.za/general/newsview.php?art_id=qw981696180625B241&amp;click_id=1890&amp;set_id=1 |title=Take heart, Valentine's every other week |publisher=Independent Online |quote=Kelly gives the saint's day of the Genoese Valentine as May 3 and also claims that Richard's engagement was announced on this day. |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090205160538/http://www.iol.co.za/general/newsview.php?art_id=qw981696180625B241&amp;click_id=1890&amp;set_id=1 |archivedate=February 5, 2009 |date=February 9, 2001 |accessdate=February 14, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jack B. Oruch notes that [[vernal equinox|the date on which spring begins]] has changed since Chaucer's time because of the [[axial precession|precession of the equinoxes]] and the introduction of the more accurate [[Gregorian calendar]] only in 1582. On the [[Julian calendar]] in use in Chaucer's time, 14 February would have fallen on the date now called 23 February, a time when some birds have started mating and nesting in England.&lt;ref name=&quot;oruch&quot;/&gt;

Chaucer's ''Parliament of Foules'' refers to a supposedly established tradition, but there is no record of such a tradition before Chaucer. The speculative derivation of sentimental customs from the distant past began with 18th-century [[Antiquary|antiquaries]], notably [[Alban Butler]], the author of ''Butler's Lives of Saints'', and have been perpetuated even by respectable modern scholars. Most notably, &quot;the idea that Valentine's Day customs perpetuated those of the Roman [[Lupercalia]] has been accepted uncritically and repeated, in various forms, up to the present&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;ansgar&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;oruch 539&quot;&gt;Oruch 1981:539.&lt;/ref&gt;

Three other authors who made poems about [[birds mating]] on St. Valentine's Day around the same years: [[Otton de Grandson]] from Savoy, [[John Gower]] from [[England]], and a knight called Pardo from Valencia. Chaucer most probably predated all of them but, due to the difficulty of dating medieval works, it is not possible to ascertain which of the four first had the idea and influenced the others.&lt;ref&gt;Ansgar, 1986, Chapter 5, Grandson, Pardo and Gower, pp. 64–76&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Court of love ===
The earliest description of February 14 as an annual celebration of love appears in the ''Charter of the Court of Love''. The charter, allegedly issued by [[Charles VI of France]] at [[Mantes-la-Jolie]] in 1400, describes lavish festivities to be attended by several members of the royal court, including a feast, amorous song and poetry competitions, [[jousting]] and dancing.&lt;ref name=&quot;ansgar court&quot;/&gt; Amid these festivities, the attending ladies would hear and rule on disputes from lovers.&lt;ref name=&quot;goodrich&quot;&gt;Goodrich, Peter (1996) ''Law in the Courts of Love''&lt;/ref&gt; No other record of the court exists, and none of those named in the charter were present at Mantes except Charles's queen, [[Isabeau of Bavaria]], who may well have imagined it all while waiting out a plague.&lt;ref name=&quot;ansgar court&quot;&gt;Ansgar, 1986, Chapter 8, The Hibermantino of the Mating Season, pp. 131–138&lt;/ref&gt;

===Valentine poetry===
The earliest surviving valentine is a 15th-century [[Rondeau (poetry)|rondeau]] written by [[Charles, Duke of Orléans]] to his wife, which commences.
{{quote|''Je suis desja d'amour tanné''&lt;br /&gt;
''Ma tres doulce Valentinée...''|Charles d'Orléans|Rondeau VI, lines 1–2&lt;ref&gt;''[[:wikisource:A Farewell to Love|A Farewell to Love]]'' in [[wikisource]]&lt;/ref&gt;}} At the time, the duke was being held in the [[Tower of London]] following his capture at the [[Battle of Agincourt]], 1415.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.history.com/topics/valentines-day History Channel], historychannel.com.&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest surviving valentines in English appear to be those in the ''[[Paston Letters]]'', written in 1477 by Margery Brewes to her future husband John Paston &quot;my right well-beloved Valentine&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Davis, Norman. ''The Paston Letters: A Selection in Modern Spelling''. Oxford University Press, 1983. pp. 233–5.&lt;/ref&gt;

Valentine's Day is mentioned ruefully by Ophelia in ''[[Hamlet]]'' (1600–1601):
{{quote|''To-morrow is Saint Valentine's day,''&lt;br /&gt;''All in the morning betime,''&lt;br /&gt;''And I a maid at your window,''&lt;br /&gt;''To be your Valentine.''&lt;br /&gt;''Then up he rose, and donn'd his clothes,''&lt;br /&gt;''And dupp'd the chamber-door;''&lt;br /&gt;''Let in the maid, that out a maid''&lt;br /&gt;''Never departed more.''|William Shakespeare|''Hamlet'', Act IV, Scene 5}}

[[John Donne]] used the legend of the marriage of the birds as the starting point for his [[epithalamion]] celebrating the marriage of [[Elizabeth of Bohemia|Elizabeth]], daughter of [[James I of England]], and [[Frederick V, Elector Palatine]], on Valentine's Day:

{{quote|''Hayle Bishop Valentine whose day this is''&lt;br /&gt;
''All the Ayre is thy Diocese''&lt;br /&gt;
''And all the chirping Queristers''&lt;br /&gt;
''And other birds ar thy parishioners''&lt;br /&gt;
''Thou marryest every yeare''&lt;br /&gt;
''The Lyrick Lark, and the graue whispering Doue,''&lt;br /&gt;
''The Sparrow that neglects his life for loue,''&lt;br /&gt;
''The houshold bird with the redd stomacher''&lt;br /&gt;
''Thou makst the Blackbird speede as soone,''&lt;br /&gt;
''As doth the Goldfinch, or the Halcyon''&lt;br /&gt;
''The Husband Cock lookes out and soone is spedd''&lt;br /&gt;
''And meets his wife, which brings her feather-bed.''&lt;br /&gt;
''This day more cheerfully than ever shine''&lt;br /&gt;
''This day which might inflame thy selfe old Valentine.''|John Donne|''Epithalamion Vpon Frederick Count Palatine and the Lady Elizabeth marryed on St. Valentines day''}}

The verse ''[[Roses are red]]'' echoes conventions traceable as far back as [[Edmund Spenser]]'s epic ''[[The Faerie Queene]]'' (1590):

In 1797, a British publisher issued ''The Young Man's Valentine Writer'', which contained scores of suggested sentimental [[Verse (poetry)|verses]] for the young lover unable to compose his own. Printers had already begun producing a limited number of cards with verses and sketches, called &quot;mechanical valentines,&quot; and a [[Penny Post#United Kingdom|reduction in postal rates]] in the next century ushered in the less personal but easier practice of mailing Valentines. That, in turn, made it possible for the first time to exchange cards anonymously, which is taken as the reason for the sudden appearance of racy verse in an era otherwise prudishly [[Victorian era|Victorian]].&lt;ref&gt;Charles Panati

In the second half of the 20th century, the practice of exchanging cards was extended to all manner of gifts. Such gifts typically include [[rose]]s, and [[chocolate]]s packed in a red satin, heart-shaped box. In the 1980s, the [[diamond]] industry began to promote Valentine's Day as an occasion for giving [[jewelry]].{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}

The U.S. Greeting Card Association estimates that approximately 190 million valentines are sent each year in the US. Half of those valentines are given to family members other than husband or wife, usually to children. When the valentine-exchange cards made in school activities are included the figure goes up to 1 billion, and teachers become the people receiving the most valentines.&lt;ref name=&quot;american&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.greetingcard.org/userfiles/file/2010%20Valentines%20Day.pdf|title=Americans Valentine's Day |year= 2010 |accessdate= February 16, 2010 |publisher= U.S. Greeting Card Association}}{{dead link|date=August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The average valentine’s spending has increased every year in the U.S, from $108 a person in 2010 to $131 in 2013.&lt;ref name=&quot;plu.edu&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mastmedia.plu.edu/2014/02/13/valentines-day-spending-is-global/|title=Valentine’s Day spending is global|work=Mast Media}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The rise of Internet popularity at the turn of the millennium is creating new traditions. Millions of people use, every year, digital means of creating and sending Valentine's Day greeting messages such as [[e-cards]], [[love coupons]] or printable greeting cards. An estimated 15 million e-valentines were sent in 2010.&lt;ref name=&quot;american&quot; /&gt; Valentine's Day is considered by some to be a [[Hallmark holiday]] due to its commercialization.&lt;ref name=&quot;wp&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/on-valentines-day-do-we-still-need-hallmark/2012/02/08/gIQAsaKP4Q_story.html|title=On Valentine’s Day, do we still need Hallmark? |last=Lenz|first=Kristin |work=[[The Washington Post]] |date=February 10, 2012|accessdate=February 14, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Celebration and status worldwide==
Valentine's Day customs{{which|date=February 2015}} developed in early modern England and spread throughout the [[Anglosphere]] in the 19th century.
In the later 20th and early 21st centuries, these customs spread to other countries, but their effect has been more limited than those of [[Halloween|Hallowe'en]], or than aspects of [[Christmas]], (such as [[Santa Claus]]).{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}

Due to a concentrated marketing effort, Valentine's Day is celebrated in some [[East Asia]]n countries with [[China|Chinese]] and [[South Korea]]ns spending the most money on Valentine's gifts.&lt;ref name=&quot;showbizandstyle.inquirer.net&quot;&gt;Domingo, Ronnel.

===Americas===

====Latin America====
In some [[Latin America]]n countries Saint Valentine's Day is known as &quot;el día de los enamorados&quot; (day of lovers)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/translate/spanish-english/enamorado#enamorado_2 enamorado], Oxford Dictionaies. Retrieved: February 14, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; or as &quot;Día del Amor y la Amistad&quot; (Day of Love and Friendship).

It is also common to see people perform &quot;acts of appreciation&quot; for their friends.
In [[Guatemala]] it is known as the &quot;Día del Cariño&quot; (Affection Day).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Para quererte |date= February 10, 2010 |work=El Periódico de Guatemala |url=http://www.elperiodico.com.gt/es/20100210/opinion/137067/ |postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt; }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Brazil]], the ''[[Dia dos Namorados]]'' (lit. &quot;Lovers' Day&quot;, or &quot;Boyfriends'/Girlfriends' Day&quot;) is celebrated on June 12, probably because that is the day before [[Anthony of Padua|Saint Anthony's]] day, known there as the ''marriage saint'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.suapesquisa.com/datascomemorativas/dia_dos_namorados.htm História do Dia dos Namorados no Brasil e no mundo, São Valentim, data 12 de junho, tradição] suapesquisa.com – Datas Comemorativas&lt;/ref&gt; when traditionally many single women perform popular rituals, called ''simpatias'', in order to find a good husband or boyfriend. Couples exchange gifts, chocolates, cards and flower bouquets. The February 14 Valentine's Day is not celebrated at all because it usually falls too little before or too little after the [[Brazilian Carnival]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,900628,00.html The Psychology of Carnaval], ''[[TIME Magazine]]'', February 14, 1969&lt;/ref&gt; — that can fall anywhere from early February to early March and lasts almost a week. Because of the absence of Valentine's Day and due to the celebrations of the Carnivals, Brazil is a popular tourist spot during February for Western singles who want to get away from the holiday.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://travel.usnews.com/features/7_Best_Cities_for_Singles/|title=7 Best Cities for Singles|work=usnews.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In most of Latin America the ''Día del amor y la amistad''  and the ''Amigo secreto'' (&quot;Secret friend&quot;) are quite popular and are usually celebrated together on February 14 (one exception is [[Colombia]], where it is celebrated on the third Saturday in September). The latter consists of randomly assigning to each participant a recipient who is to be given an anonymous gift (similar to the [[Christmas]] tradition of [[Secret Santa]]).{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}

===Asia===

====China====
In Chinese, Valentine's Day is called lovers' festival ({{zh|s=情人节|t=情人節|p=qíng rén jié}}). The &quot;Chinese Valentine's Day&quot; is the [[Qixi Festival]], celebrated on the seventh day of the seventh month of the lunar calendar. It commemorates a day on which a legendary cowherder and weaving maid are allowed to be together. In [[Chinese culture]], there is an older observance related to lovers, called &quot;[[Qi Xi|The Night of Sevens]]&quot; ({{zh|c=七夕|p=Qi Xi}}). According to the legend, the [[Altair|Cowherd star]] and the [[Vega|Weaver Maid star]] are normally separated by the [[Milky Way]] (silvery river) but are allowed to meet by crossing it on the 7th day of the 7th month of the [[Chinese calendar]].{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}

In recent years, celebrating [[White Day]] has also become fashionable among some young people.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}

====India====
In [[India]], in antiquity, there was a tradition of adoring [[Kamadeva]], the lord of love; exemplificated by the erotic carvings in the [[Khajuraho Group of Monuments]] and by the writing of the [[Kamasutra]] treaty of lovemaking.&lt;ref name=&quot;rana&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=India's fascination with Valentine's Day |author=Rana, Vijay |work=[[BBC]] |date=February 14, 2002 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/1820440.stm |postscript=  }}&lt;/ref&gt; This tradition was lost around the [[Middle Ages]], when Kamadeva was no longer celebrated, and public displays of sexual affection became frowned upon.&lt;ref name=&quot;rana&quot;/&gt; This repression of public affections persisted until the 1990s.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}

Valentine's Day celebrations did not catch on in India until around 1992. It was spread due to the programs in commercial TV channels, such as [[MTV]], dedicated radio programs and love letter competitions, in addition to an economical liberalization that allowed the explosion of the valentine card industry.&lt;ref name=&quot;rana&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;derne&quot;/&gt; Economic liberalization also helped the Valentine card industry.&lt;ref name=&quot;derne&quot;/&gt; The celebration has caused a sharp change on how people have been displaying their affection in public since the Middle Ages.&lt;ref name=&quot;rana&quot;/&gt;

In modern times, Hindu and Islamic&lt;ref name=&quot;monger&quot;/&gt; traditionalists have considered the holiday to be cultural contamination from the West, a result of the globalization in India.&lt;ref name=&quot;rana&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;derne&quot;/&gt; [[Shiv Sena]] and the [[Sangh Parivar]] have asked their followers to shun the holiday and the &quot;public admission of love&quot; because of them being &quot;alien to Indian culture&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;sandbrook&quot;&gt;{{Cite book |title= Civilizing globalization: a survival guide |series= SUNY series in radical social and political theory |editor= Richard Sandbrook |author= Anil Mathew Varughese |chapter= Globalization versus cultural authenticity?

Valentine's Day has been strongly criticized from a [[postcolonial]] perspective by intellectuals from the Indian left. The holiday is regarded as a front for &quot;Western imperialism&quot;, &quot;[[neocolonialism]]&quot;, and &quot;the exploitation of working classes through [[commercialism]] by [[multinational corporation]]s&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Sharma|first1= Satya|year= 1996|title= The cultural costs of a globalized economy for India |journal= Dialectical Anthropology |volume=21 |issue= 3–4|pages= 299–316 |doi= 10.1007/BF00245771}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is claimed that as a result of Valentine's Day, the [[working class]]es and [[Rural poverty|rural poor]] become more disconnected socially, politically, and geographically from the hegemonic [[capitalist]] power structure. They also criticize mainstream media attacks on Indians opposed to Valentine's Day as a form of [[demonization]] that is designed and derived to further the Valentine's Day agenda.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Mankekar|first= Purnima|year= 1999|title= Screening, Culture, Viewing Politics: An Ethnography of Television, Womanhood  Nation in Postcolonial India |publisher= Duke University Press|isbn= 0-8223-2390-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;As quoted in ‘India Today: Pot Pourri Generation’ September 15 issue, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

====Iran====
In the first part of the 21st century, the celebration of Valentine's Day in [[Iran]] has been harshly criticized by Islamic teachers who see the celebrations as opposed to [[Islamic culture]]. In 2011, the Iranian printing works owners' union issued a directive banning the printing and distribution of any goods promoting the holiday, including [[greeting card|cards]], gifts and [[teddy bear]]s. &quot;Printing and producing any goods related to this day including posters, boxes and cards emblazoned with hearts or half-hearts, red [[rose]]s and any activities promoting this day are banned&amp;nbsp;...

In Iran, the [[Sepandarmazgan]], or Esfandegan, is a festival where people express love towards their mothers and wives, and it is also a celebration of earth in ancient Persian culture.
It has been progressively forgotten in favor of the Western celebration of Valentine's Day. The Association of Iran's Cultural and Natural Phenomena has been trying since 2006 to make Sepandarmazgan a national holiday on February 17, in order to replace the Western holiday.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Esfandegan to Replace Valentine |publisher=Iran Daily |page=6 |date=December 31, 2008 |url=http://www.nitc.co.ir/iran-daily/1387/3307/pdf/i6.pdf |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110511131810/http://www.nitc.co.ir/iran-daily/1387/3307/pdf/i6.pdf |archivedate=May 11, 2008 |postscript= &lt;!--None--&gt;}}, nitc.co.ir&lt;/ref&gt;

====Israel====
In [[Israel]], the Jewish tradition of [[Tu B'Av]] has been revived and transformed into the Jewish equivalent of Valentine's Day. It is celebrated on the 15th day of the month of [[Av]] (usually in late August). In ancient times girls would wear white dresses and dance in the vineyards, where the boys would be waiting for them ([[Mishna]] Taanith end of Chapter 4). Today, Tu B'Av is celebrated as a second holiday of love by secular people (along with Valentine's Day), and it shares many of the customs associated with Saint Valentine's Day in western societies. In modern Israeli culture Tu B'Av is a popular day to pronounce love, propose marriage and give gifts like cards or flowers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Evolution of Tu Be'av into Jewish Valentine's Day |date= February 8, 2012|work= [[The Jerusalem Post]] |author=Binyamin Kagedan |url= http://www.jpost.com/JewishWorld/JewishFeatures/Article.aspx?id=279840}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Japan====
In [[Japan]], [[Morozoff Ltd.]] introduced the holiday for the first time in 1936, when it ran an advertisement aimed at foreigners. Later in 1953, it began promoting the giving of heart-shaped chocolates; other Japanese confectionery companies followed suit thereafter. In 1958, the [[Isetan]] [[Department stores in Japan|department store]] ran a &quot;Valentine sale&quot;. Further campaigns during the 1960s popularized the custom.&lt;ref name=japantimes&gt;{{cite news |last=Gordenker |first=Alice |title=White Day |url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2006/03/21/news/white-day/ |work=[[The Japan Times]] |date=March 21, 2006 |accessdate=June 30, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;rupp&quot;&gt;{{Cite book |title= Gift-giving in Japan: cash, connections, cosmologies |author= Katherine Rupp |edition= illustrated |publisher= [[Stanford University Press]] |year= 2003 |isbn= 0-8047-4704-0|pages=149–151 |url= https://books.google.com/?id=KHkyUp-EH2MC&amp;lpg=PA150&amp;dq=japan%20valentine's%20day&amp;pg=PA145#v=onepage&amp;q=japan%20valentine's%20day |postscript= &lt;!--None--&gt; }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The custom that only women give chocolates to men may have originated from the translation error of a chocolate-company executive during the initial campaigns.&lt;ref name=&quot;jasgp&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Valentine's Day in Japan |author=Chris Yeager |date=February 13, 2009 |publisher=[[Japan America Society of Greater Philadelphia]] (JASGP) |url= http://jasgp.org/content/view/636/179/ |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110725083844/http://jasgp.org/content/view/636/179/ |archivedate=July 25, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, [[Office lady|office ladies]] give chocolate to their co-workers. Unlike western countries, gifts such as greeting cards,&lt;ref name=&quot;jasgp&quot;/&gt; candies, [[flower]]s, or [[dating|dinner dates]]&lt;ref name=&quot;yoshimura&quot;/&gt; are uncommon, and most of the activity about the gifts is about giving the right amount of chocolate to each person.&lt;ref name=&quot;jasgp&quot;/&gt; Japanese chocolate companies make half their annual sales during this time of the year.&lt;ref name=&quot;jasgp&quot;/&gt;

Many women feel obliged to give chocolates to all male co-workers, except when the day falls on a Sunday, a holiday. This is known as ''giri-choko'' (義理チョコ), from ''[[Giri (Japanese)|giri]]'' (&quot;obligation&quot;) and ''choko'', (&quot;chocolate&quot;), with unpopular co-workers receiving only &quot;ultra-obligatory&quot; ''chō-giri choko'' cheap chocolate. This contrasts with ''honmei-choko'' (本命チョコ, lit. &quot;true feeling chocolate&quot;), chocolate given to a loved one. Friends, especially girls, may exchange chocolate referred to as ''tomo-choko'' (友チョコ); from ''tomo'' meaning &quot;friend&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Office Ladies and Salaried Men: Power, Gender, and Work in Japanese Companies | author = Yuko Ogasawara | edition = illustrated | editor = [[University of California Press]] | year = 1998 | isbn = 0-520-21044-1 | pages = 98–113, 142–154, 156, 163 | url = https://books.google.com/?id=9_yjfAZo4jIC&amp;pg=PA98&amp;vq=valentine+day&amp;dq=japan+chocolate+saint+valentin | publisher = [[University of California Press]]| location = Berkeley }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1980s, the Japanese National Confectionery Industry Association launched a successful campaign to make March 14 a &quot;reply day&quot;, where men are expected to return the favour to those who gave them chocolates on Valentine's Day, calling it [[White Day]] for the color of the chocolates being offered. A previous failed attempt to popularize this celebration had been done by a [[marshmallow]] manufacturer who wanted men to return marshmallows to women.&lt;ref name=&quot;japantimes&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;rupp&quot;/&gt;

Men are expected to return gifts that are at least two or three times more valuable than the gifts received in Valentine's Day. Not returning the gift is perceived as the man placing himself in a position of superiority, even if excuses are given. Returning a present of equal value is considered as a way to say that the relationship is being cut. Originally only chocolate was given, but now the gifts of jewelry, accessories, clothing and lingerie are usual. According to the official website of White Day, the color white was chosen because it's the color of purity, evoking &quot;pure, sweet teen love&quot;, and because it's also the color of sugar. The initial name was &quot;Ai ni Kotaeru White Day&quot; (Answer Love on White Day).&lt;ref name=&quot;japantimes&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;rupp&quot;/&gt;

In Japan, the romantic &quot;date night&quot; associated to Valentine's Day is celebrated on [[Christmas Eve]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |date=February 14, 2007 |author= Ron Huza (he was an [[English as a foreign or second language|ESL]] in Japan for 11 years) |title= Lost in translation: The cultural divide over Valentine's Day |work= [[The Gazette (Montreal)|The Gazette]] |url= http://www.canada.com/montrealgazette/news/editorial/story.html?id=2ae6a44a-2f29-45a3-a257-2a13b3d3149d |postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt; }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2006 survey of people between 10 and 49 years of age in Japan, [[Oricon|Oricon Style]] found the 1986 [[Sayuri Kokushō]] [[Single (music)|single]] &quot;[[Valentine Kiss]]&quot; to be the most popular Valentine's Day song, even though it sold only 317,000 copies.&lt;ref name=&quot;oricon-pop-valentine&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oricon.co.jp/news/ranking/11073/|script-title=ja:大公開！『バレンタインソング』といえばこの曲！|trans_title=The Great Exhibition!

The final song in the top five was &quot;[[My Funny Valentine]]&quot; by [[Miles Davis]].&lt;ref name=&quot;oricon-pop-valentine&quot;/&gt;

In Japan, a slightly different version of a holiday based on a lovers' story called [[Tanabata]] (七夕) has been celebrated for centuries, on July 7 ([[Gregorian calendar]]).&lt;ref&gt;Caprice ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=Y9c9AvTd9RUC&amp;pg=PA305&amp;dq=Tanabata+july+7th&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=ac1QTPi0H8bGONGczNQI&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CC8Q6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Tanabata%20july%207th&amp;f=false Reflections]'' AuthorHouse, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; It has been considered by Westerners as similar to St. Valentine's Day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Japan has a Valentine Day based on a tender legend |author= E.I.S. |work= [[New York Times]] |date= February 15, 1925 |url= http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F20612FD395B12738DDDAC0994DA405B858EF1D3 |postscript= &lt;!--None--&gt; }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Lebanon ====

[[Saint Valentine]] is the [[patron saint]] for a large part of the Lebanese population. Couples take the opportunity of Valentine's feast day to exchange sweet words and gifts as proof of love. Such gifts typically include chocolates boxes, Valentine's Cupcakes as well as red roses which are the emblem of sacrifice and passion.

==== Malaysia ====
Islamic officials in [[Malaysia]] warned Muslims against celebrating Valentine's Day, linking it with vice activities. Deputy Prime Minister Muhyiddin Yassin said the celebration of romantic love was &quot;not suitable&quot; for Muslims. Wan Mohamad Sheikh Abdul Aziz, head of the Malaysian Islamic Development Department ([[JAKIM#Official religion|Jakim]]), which oversees the country's Islamic policies said that a [[fatwa]] (ruling) issued by the country's top clerics in 2005 noted that the day 'is associated with elements of Christianity,' and 'we just cannot get involved with other religions' worshipping rituals.' Jakim officials planned to carry out a nationwide campaign called &quot;Awas Jerat Valentine's Day&quot; (&quot;Mind the Valentine's Day Trap&quot;), aimed at preventing Muslims from celebrating the day on February 14, 2011. Activities include conducting raids in hotels to stop young couples from having unlawful sex and distributing leaflets to Muslim university students warning them against the day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Malaysian Muslims warned against Valentine's Day |work=[[The Straits Times]] |date=February 13, 2011 |url=http://www.straitstimes.com/BreakingNews/SEAsia/Story/STIStory_634485.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110429094726/http://www.straitstimes.com/BreakingNews/SEAsia/Story/STIStory_634485.html |archivedate=April 29, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Malaysia Warns Muslims of Valentine's Day Trap |publisher=BBC News |date= February 13, 2011 |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-pacific-12443104}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On Valentine's Day 2011, Malaysian religious authorities arrested more than 100 Muslim couples concerning the celebration ban. Some of them would be charged in the Shariah Court for defying the department's ban against the celebration of Valentine's Day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thejakartaglobe.com/home/malaysia-arrests-100-muslim-couples-for-celebrating-lovers-day/422743 |title=Malaysia Arrests 100 Muslim Couples for Celebrating Lovers' Day |publisher=The Jakarta Globe |date= |accessdate=August 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Pakistan ====
The concept of Valentine's Day was introduced into Pakistan during the late 1990s with special TV and radio programs. The [[Jamaat-e-Islami Pakistan|Jamaat-e-Islami]] political party has called for the banning of Valentine's Day celebration.&lt;ref name=&quot;bbcanger&quot;/&gt; Despite this, the celebration is becoming popular among urban youth and the florists expect to sell a great amount of flowers, especially red roses. The case is the same with card publishers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Flower sellers await Valentine's Day |publisher=[[The Nation (Pakistani newspaper)|The Nation]] |date=February 8, 2010 |url=http://www.nation.com.pk/pakistan-news-newspaper-daily-english-online/Regional/Islamabad/08-Feb-2010/Flower-sellers-await-Valentines-Day |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110427063605/http://www.nation.com.pk/pakistan-news-newspaper-daily-english-online/Regional/Islamabad/08-Feb-2010/Flower-sellers-await-Valentines-Day |archivedate=April 27, 2011 |postscript= &lt;!--None--&gt; }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, local governing body of Peshwar officially banned the celebration of Valentine's Day in the city of Peshwar. The ban was also implemented in other city such as Kohat by the local government.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/pakistan-valentines-day-celebrations-banned-peshawar-1543705 &quot;Pakistan: Valentine's Day celebrations banned in Peshawar&quot;] February 13, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

====Philippines====
In the [[Philippines]], Valentine's Day is called ''Araw ng mga Puso'' in much the same manner as in the West. It is usually marked by a steep increase in the price of flowers, particularly red roses.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}

====Saudi Arabia====
In [[Saudi Arabia]], in 2002 and 2008, [[Committee for the Promotion of Virtue and the Prevention of Vice (Saudi Arabia)|religious police]] banned the sale of all Valentine's Day items, telling shop workers to remove any red items, because the day is considered a Christian holiday.&lt;ref name=&quot;bbc 2002&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title=Cooling the ardour of Valentine's Day |publisher=BBC News |date=February 3, 2002 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/1818642.stm }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;bbc saudi&quot;/&gt; This ban has created a [[black market]] for [[rose]]s and [[wrapping paper]].&lt;ref name=&quot;bbc saudi&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/7239005.stm |title=Saudis clamp down on valentines |publisher=BBC News |date=February 11, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;LA Times 2010&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title= Saudi officials put the squeeze on Valentine's Day |author= Lutz, Meris |date= February 13, 2010 |work= [[LA Times]] |url= http://articles.latimes.com/2010/feb/13/world/la-fg-saudi-valentine13-2010feb13}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, the religious police arrested more than 140 Muslims for celebrating the holiday, and confiscated all red roses from flower shops.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title= Religious police swoop on Valentine's Day lovers |date= February 15, 2012 |author= BBC |work= ABC News |url= http://www.abc.net.au/news/2012-02-15/saudi-heart-breakers/3830624 |postscript= &lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter.

&quot;Saudi cleric Sheikh Muhammad Al-'Arifi said on Valentine's Day Eve that celebrating this holiday constitutes [[bid'a]] – a forbidden innovation and deviation from religious law and custom – and mimicry of the West.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Raialyoum.com, February 13, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.memri.org/report/en/0/0/0/0/0/0/7994.htm#_edn2 &quot;Saudis Sentenced To Prison, Flogging For Celebrating Valentine's Day.&quot;] MEMRI.org.

====Singapore====
According to findings, [[Singapore]]ans are among the biggest spenders on Valentine's Day, with 60% of Singaporeans indicating that they would spend between $100 and $500 during the season leading up to the holiday.&lt;ref name=&quot;showbizandstyle.inquirer.net&quot;/&gt;

====South Korea====
In [[South Korea]], women give chocolate to men on February 14, and men give non-chocolate candy to women on March 14 ([[White Day]]). On April 14 (Black Day), those who did not receive anything on February 14 or March go to a Chinese-Korean restaurant to eat black noodles (자장면 ''[[jajangmyeon]]'') and lament their 'single life'.&lt;ref name=yoshimura /&gt; Koreans also celebrate [[Pepero Day]] on November 11, when young couples give each other Pepero cookies. The date '11/11' is intended to resemble the long shape of the cookie. The 14th of every month marks a love-related day in Korea, although most of them are obscure. From January to December: Candle Day, Valentine's Day, White Day, [[Black Day]], Rose Day, Kiss Day, Silver Day, Green Day, Music Day, Wine Day, Movie Day, and Hug Day.&lt;ref&gt;{{Wayback |date=20090217041952 |url=http://www.centredaily.com/479/story/1118881.html |title=Korea rivals U.S. in romantic holidays }}, ''Centre Daily Times'', February 14, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Korean women give a much higher amount of chocolate than Japanese women.&lt;ref name=yoshimura&gt;{{cite journal |title= No matter where you're from, Valentine's Day still means the same |author= Risa Yoshimura |volume= 78 |issue= 18 |date= February 14, 2006 |work= [[The Pacer]] |url= http://pacer.utm.edu/2926.htm |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20060427124136/http://pacer.utm.edu/2926.htm |archivedate= April 27, 2006 |postscript= &lt;!--None--&gt; }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Taiwan====

In [[Republic of China|Taiwan]], traditional [[Qixi Festival]], Valentine's Day and White Day are all celebrated. However, the situation is the reverse of Japan's. Men give gifts to women on Valentine's Day, and women return them on [[White Day]].&lt;ref name=yoshimura /&gt;

===Europe===

====United Kingdom====
In the UK, just under half of the population spend money on their Valentines and around £1.3 billion is spent yearly on cards, flowers, chocolates and other gifts, with an estimated 25 million cards being sent.

In Wales, some people celebrate [[Dydd Santes Dwynwen]] (''St Dwynwen's Day'') on January 25 instead of (or as well as) Valentine's Day. The day commemorates [[Dwynwen|St Dwynwen]], the patron saint of Welsh lovers.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}

====Finland and Estonia====
In [[Finland]] Valentine's Day is called ''ystävänpäivä'' which translates into &quot;Friend's Day&quot;. As the name indicates, this day is more about remembering friends, not significant others. In [[Estonia]] Valentine's Day is called ''sõbrapäev'', which has the same meaning.&lt;ref name=&quot;s6brap2ev&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.folklore.ee/Berta/tahtpaev-valentinipaev.php|title=BERTA - Eesti rahvakalendri tähtpäevade andmebaas|work=folklore.ee}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====France====
In France, a traditionally [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] country, Valentine's Day is known simply as &quot;[[Saint Valentine|Saint Valentin]]&quot;, and is celebrated in much the same way as other western countries.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}

====Greece====
St. Valentine's Day, or Ημέρα του Αγίου Βαλεντίνου in Greek tradition was not associated with romantic love; In the Eastern Orthodox church there is another Saint  who protects people who are in love, [[Hyacinth of Caesarea]] (feast day July 3), but in contemporary Greece, this tradition has mostly been superseded by the &quot;globalized&quot; form of Valentine's Day.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}

====Portugal====
In [[Portugal]] it is more commonly referred to as &quot;Dia dos Namorados&quot; (Lover's Day / Day of the Enamoured).{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}

====Romania====
In recent years, Romania has also started celebrating Valentine's Day. This has drawn backlash from several groups, institutions&lt;ref&gt;{{Wayback |date=20100627093822 |url=http://www.cultura.ro/Documents.aspx?ID=190 |title=Valentine`s Day versus Dragobete }}, cultura.ro {{ro icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; and nationalist organizations like [[Noua Dreapta|Noua Dreaptǎ]], who condemn Valentine's Day for being superficial, commercialist and imported Western [[kitsch]]. In order to counter the perceived denaturation of national culture, [[Dragobete]], a spring festival celebrated in parts of Southern Romania, has been rekindled as the traditional Romanian holiday for lovers. Its date used to vary depending on the geographical area, however nowadays it is commonly observed on February 24. The holiday is named after a character from Romanian folklore who was supposed to be the son of [[Baba Dochia]]. His name has been associated, possibly through [[folk etymology]], to the word ''drag'' (&quot;dear&quot;), which can also be found in the word ''dragoste'' (&quot;love&quot;).{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}

====Scandinavia====
[[File:Valentine's Day dinner group at Lars Jacob's 2015 (1).JPG|thumb|[[Lars Jacob]] and Emil Eikner host a Valentine's Day celebration dinner in [[Stockholm]] in 2015]]
In [[Denmark]] and [[Norway]], although February 14 is known as ''Valentinsdag'', it is not celebrated to a large extent, but is largely imported from American culture, and some people take time to eat a romantic dinner with their partner, to send a card to a secret love or give a red rose to their loved one. The cut-flower industry in particular is still working on promoting the holiday. In Sweden it is called ''Alla hjärtans dag'' (&quot;All Hearts' Day&quot;) and was launched in the 1960s by the flower industry's commercial interests, and due to the influence of American culture. It is not an official holiday, but its celebration is recognized and sales of cosmetics and flowers for this holiday are only exceeded by those for Mother's Day.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}

====Spain====

In Spain, Valentine's Day is known as &quot;[[Saint Valentine|San Valentín]]&quot; and is celebrated the same way as in the UK, it is however not celebrated in [[Catalonia]].{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}

[[File:Selburose-sweater.jpg|thumb|280px|A pullover]]
A '''sweater''' (American English) is a knitted garment intended to cover the torso and arms.&lt;ref&gt;[http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/sweater sweater: definition of sweater in Oxford dictionary (British &amp; World English),&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; A sweater is either a '''pullover''' or a [[cardigan (sweater)|cardigan]], distinguished in that cardigans open at the front while pullovers do not. In British English, a pullover may also be called a '''jumper''' or '''jersey''', and there is no [[hypernym]] equivalent to ''sweater'' covering both pullovers and cardigans.

Sweaters are worn by adults and children of all genders; often over a [[shirt]], [[blouse]], [[T-shirt]], or other top, but sometimes next to the skin. Sweaters were traditionally made from [[wool]], but can now be made of [[cotton]], [[synthetic fiber]]s, or any combination thereof. Sweaters are maintained by washing or dry cleaning, and the use of a [[lint roller]] or [[Pill (textile)|pill]] razor.

[[File:Hot dog sweater 1434172037.jpg|thumb| left|&quot;Hot dog&quot; Sweater]]
The term &quot;sweater&quot; is a catch-all for a variety of knit garments. Although the term often refers to a pullover, it can also refer to a [[cardigan (sweater)|cardigan]], a garment that opens and fastens down the front. Within either group, there is a great variety of design. Various [[neckline]]s are found, although the V-neck, turtleneck and the crew neck are the most popular.  The [[waistline (clothing)|waistline]] is typically at hip height or slightly longer, just overlapping the waist of one's pants or skirt, but can vary significantly. It can range from just below the bust in women's garments to mid-thigh in either sex, or even longer in a knitted variation of the [[poncho]] [[shirtdress]]. The [[sleeve]] length is also variable, ranging from full-length or three-quarters to short-sleeved, cap sleeves or sleeveless. The front [[style line|seam]] or opening of a cardigan allows for further different styles, such as a [[surplice]] or a [[bolero jacket]].  All hems may have various types of borders, such as [[picot]]s, [[ribbing (knitting)|ribbing]] and frills.

[[basic knitted fabrics|Knitted fabrics]] are generally somewhat [[elasticity (physics)|elastic]] and have a softer hand (feel or drape) than woven fabric, sweaters that are more tightly fitted or have a soft drape may conform well to the body without requiring [[tailoring]] necessary in a woven garment such as darts, flares and gores. Even when such shaping is used, it can be knit into the fabric itself, without requiring seams.

==Nomenclature==
[[File:1940 Trachtenstrickjacke anagoria.JPG|thumb|A sweater]]
[[File:Islandpullover 004.jpg|thumb| A pullover from Iceland]]
[[File:Jumper altered PsCSJPG10.jpg|thumb|A jumper.]]
A sweater with an open front fastened by [[button]]s or a [[zipper]] is generally called a '''[[Cardigan (sweater)|cardigan]]''', but the nomenclature for other styles in different [[List of dialects of the English language|dialects]] can be quite confusing. In [[British English]], a sweater may also be called a pullover, jumper or jersey. In the United States however, &quot;[[Jumper (dress)|jumper]]&quot; refers to a style of women's sleeveless dress, worn over a blouse or shirt, and &quot;jersey&quot; refers to a knit shirt, especially if part of an athletic uniform. If sleeveless, such a garment may be called a &quot;tank top&quot; in British English, while &quot;tank top&quot; in [[US English]] refers to a [[sleeveless shirt|sleeveless shirt or undershirt]]. In the U.S. and in [[Australian English]], a sleeveless sweater may also be called a [[sweater vest]], especially if it has a V-neck and somewhat formal appearance resembling a formal vest, a garment known as a [[waistcoat]] in the U.K. In British English, &quot;vest&quot; refers to an undershirt. In [[South African English]], a sweater is always called a '''jersey'''. In the sport of [[ice hockey]], the top of a hockey player's uniform had traditionally been a sweater; and even though modern hockey uniform tops are more commonly a [[jersey (clothing)|jersey]] they are typically referred to as a &quot;hockey sweater,&quot; regardless of the style, but frequently, in the U.S. it is called a hockey &quot;jersey.&quot;

==Customary wear==
[[File:Seaman jumper.JPG|thumb|right|Seaman's jumper, woolen, hand-knitted.]]
Thin sweaters may be worn tucked in to the waistband of [[trousers]]; but otherwise, men's sweaters are worn untucked. Nonetheless, some individuals, including some television and film actors, have been known for wearing tucked-in sweaters.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gq.com/style/style-guy/coats-and-sweaters/200501/tucking-in-models-ralph-lauren&lt;!--Notable individuals seen wearing their sweaters tucked include [[Cary Grant]], [[Gary Cooper]], [[Russ Salzberg]], [[Sylvester McCoy]], and [[Hadley Eliker]].  The most widely known is [[Bill Cosby]], for whom the [[neologism]] ''Cosby sweater'' was coined. &lt;see previous cite for link&gt; --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Sweaters are a versatile item of clothing and can be worn on top of almost any outfit. Sports sweaters are often worn on tops of sports kit while traveling to or from a sports ground. Sweaters can be worn with a [[dress shirt]] underneath (and optionally a [[Necktie|tie]]), which has the advantage of allowing the wearer to have the option of removing the sweater when it is uncomfortably warm and still looking presentable in many situations. Layering and the ease with which it allows for temperature regulation is a major benefit of the sweater as an article of clothing. Various methods have evolved for conveniently carrying a sweater, once removed.  The three most common approaches are: around the waist (either loin cloth, or knotted in front style) and over the shoulder.

In the late 20th century the sweater increasingly came to be worn as an alternative to a shirt when finer materials made them more comfortable next to the skin.

Some people enjoy wearing Christmas related sweaters around Christmas time to get into the festive spirit. 
Some women's sweaters are meant to be worn belted; a belt or drawstring is sometimes knitted into the sweater itself. Leggings are commonly worn with long sweaters or [[sweater dress]]es.

==Ice hockey==
The [[Hockey jersey|uniforms]] that present day [[ice hockey]] players wear are sometimes referred to as &quot;sweaters&quot;, although they more closely resemble the jerseys worn in [[Football (soccer)|other sports]]. This is because original uniforms were simply sweaters with the team's logo stitched on the front. However, as technology changed, so did the uniforms as actual sweaters absorbed too much moisture and became weighed down and bulky throughout the course of a game.

==Sweatshirts==
{{anchor|Sweatshirt}}Sweatshirts are arguably a type of sweater, but made of a fabric and cut similar to [[sweatpants]]. A sweatshirt worn with sweatpants forms a [[sweatsuit]] a kind of exercise clothing designed to raise the core body temperature and cause [[perspiration]] in order to lose body weight before a weigh in for a weight divided sport. It is fashioned out of a thick, usually cotton jersey material.{{cn|date=July 2015}} Sweatshirts are also almost exclusively casual attire and not dressy as some other sweaters may be. Sweatshirts may or may not have a zipper or hood.

In the [[Gregorian calendar]], Diwali night falls between mid-October and mid-November.

Before Diwali night, people clean, renovate, and decorate their homes and offices.&lt;ref name=&quot;Raat&quot;&gt;{{cite book|url = https://books.google.com/?id=6A9EZRQIT9kC&amp;pg=PA109&amp;dq=lamps+kept+on+diwali+lakshmi#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title = Meri Khoj Ek Bharat Ki|author=Pramodkumar|quote=It is extremely important to keep the house spotlessly clean and pure on Diwali.

Diwali is an important festival for Hindus. The name of festive days as well as the rituals of Diwali vary significantly among Hindus, based on the region of India. In many parts of India,&lt;ref&gt;Karen Bellenir (1997), Religious Holidays and Calendars: An Encyclopedic Handbook, 2nd Edition, ISBN 978-0780802582, Omnigraphics&lt;/ref&gt; the festivities start with [[Dhanteras]] (in Northern and Western part of India), followed by [[Naraka Chaturdashi|Naraka Chaturdasi]] on second day, Deepavali on the third day, ''Diwali Padva'' dedicated to wife–husband relationship on the fourth day, and festivities end with [[Bhau-beej]] dedicated to sister–brother bond on the fifth day. [[Dhanteras]] usually falls eighteen days after [[Navrati|Dussehra]].

On the same night that Hindus celebrate Diwali, [[Jainism|Jains]] celebrate a festival of lights to mark the attainment of ''[[moksha]]'' by [[Mahavira]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Sharma2006&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|year=2006|title=Fairs and Festivals of India|first=S.P.|last=Sharma|first2=Seema|last2=Gupta|publisher=Pustak Mahal|isbn=978-81-223-0951-5|page=79|url=https://books.google.com/?id=wPPr9HdmnHcC&amp;pg=PA79&amp;dq=diwali+mahavira+527}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;N.

Diwali dates back to ancient times in India, as a festival after the summer harvest in the [[Hindu calendar]] month of [[Kartik (month)|Kartika]]. The festival is mentioned in Sanskrit scriptures such as the ''[[Padma Purana]]'', the ''[[Skanda Purana]]'' both completed in second half of 1st millennium AD but believed to have been expanded from a core text from an earlier era. The ''diyas'' (lamps) are mentioned in Skanda Purana to symbolically represent parts of sun, the cosmic giver of light and energy to all life, who seasonally transitions in the Hindu calendar month of Kartik.&lt;ref name=tp&gt;Pintchman, Tracy. ''Guests at God's Wedding: Celebrating Kartik among the Women of Benares'', pp.&amp;nbsp;59–65. State University of New York Press, 2005. ISBN 0-7914-6596-9.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lochtefeld, James G. &quot;Kartik&quot; in ''The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Hinduism'', Vol.&amp;nbsp;1:&amp;nbsp;A–M, p.&amp;nbsp;355. Rosen Publishing. ISBN 978-0-8239-3179-8.&lt;/ref&gt; Hindus in some regions of India associate Diwali with the legend of Yama and [[Nachiketa]] on Kartika ''amavasya'' (Diwali night).&lt;ref&gt;[http://sanskritdocuments.org/articles/diwali-article-200310-tarang.pdf Diwali – the season of Festivals] Tarang (October 2003), page 4&lt;/ref&gt; The Nachiketa story about right versus wrong, transient wealth versus true wealth, ignorance versus knowledge is recorded in [[Katha Upanishad]] composed in 1st millennium BC.&lt;ref&gt;[[Max Müller]] (Translator), The Upanishads, {{Google books|gV8sAAAAYAAJ|Katha Upanishad|page=1}}, Quote: &quot;The wise prefers the good to the pleasant, but the fool chooses the pleasant through greed and avarice. Wide apart are these two, ignorance and wisdom. [...] What is called a treasure is transient, for the eternal is not obtained by things which are not eternal. The wise who, by means of meditation on his Self, recognizes the Ancient, he indeed leaves (transient) joy and sorrow far behind. [...] Beyond the senses there are the objects, beyond the objects there is the mind, beyond the mind there is the intellect, the Self is beyond the intellect. Beyond the Self is the Undeveloped, beyond the Undeveloped is the [[Purusha]]. Beyond the Purusha there is nothing, this is the goal, the highest road. A wise man should keep down speech and (impulses of) mind, he should keep them within the Self which is knowledge.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

King Harsha in the 7th century Sanskrit play [[Nagananda]] mentions Deepavali as ''Deepapratipadutsava'', where lamps were lit and newly engaged brides and grooms were given gifts.&lt;ref name=bnsharma&gt;BN Sharma, Festivals of India, South Asia Books, ISBN 978-0836402834, pp. 9–35&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=yaksha&gt;{{cite book|last1=Varadpande|first1=Manohar Laxman|title=History of Indian Theatre, Volume 1|date=1987|publisher=Abhinav Publications|isbn=9788170172215|page=159|accessdate=18 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Rajasekhara]] referred to Deepavali as ''Dipamalika'' in his 9th century ''Kavyamimamsa'', wherein he mentions the tradition of homes being whitewashed and oil lamps decorating homes, streets and markets in the night.&lt;ref name=bnsharma/&gt; The Persian traveller and historian [[Abū Rayḥān al-Bīrūnī|Al Biruni]], in his 11th century memoir on India, wrote Deepavali being celebrated by Hindus on New Moon day of the month of Kartika.&lt;ref&gt;R.N. Nandi (2009), in A Social History of Early India (Editor: B. Chattopadhyaya), Volume 2, Part 5, Pearson Education, ISBN 978-8131719589, pp. 183–184&lt;/ref&gt;

==Significance==
Diwali is one of the happiest holidays in India and [[Nepal]] with significant preparations. People clean their homes and decorate them for the festivities. Diwali is one of the biggest shopping seasons in India and [[Nepal]]; people buy new clothes for themselves and their families, as well as gifts, appliances, kitchen utensils, even expensive items such as cars and gold jewelry.&lt;ref&gt;Dianne MacMillan (1997), Diwali: Hindu Festival of Lights, Enslow Publishers, ISBN 978-0894908170&lt;/ref&gt; People also buy gifts for family members and friends which typically include sweets, dry fruits, and seasonal specialties depending on regional harvest and customs. It is also the period when children hear ancient stories, legends, myths about battles between good and evil or light and darkness from their parents and elders. Girls and women go shopping and create rangoli and other creative patterns on floors, near doors and walkways. Youth and adults alike help with lighting and preparing for ''patakhe'' (fireworks).&lt;ref name=dhcd&gt;Deborah Heiligman, Celebrate Diwali, ISBN 978-0-7922-5923-7, National Geographic Society, Washington DC&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Suzanne Barchers 2013&quot;&gt;Suzanne Barchers (2013), The Big Book of Holidays and Cultural Celebrations, Shell Education, ISBN 978-1425810481&lt;/ref&gt;

There is significant variation in regional practices and rituals. Depending on the region, prayers are offered before one or more deities, with most common being Lakshmi – the goddess of wealth and prosperity. On Diwali night, fireworks light up the neighborhood skies. Later, family members and invited friends celebrate the night over food and sweets.&lt;ref name=&quot;dhcd&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Suzanne Barchers 2013&quot;/&gt;

===Spiritual significance===
Diwali is celebrated by Hindus, Jains, and Sikhs and some Buddhists&lt;ref name=&quot;diwaliBuddhist&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thehindu.com/features/kids/light-that-lamp/article4066750.ece|title=Light that lamp}}&lt;/ref&gt; to mark different historical events, stories or myths but they all symbolise the victory of light over darkness, knowledge over ignorance, good over evil, hope over despair.&lt;ref name=htoday&gt;[http://www.hinduismtoday.com/pdf_downloads/pagers/Hindu-Festival_Diwali_broadsheet-color.pdf Diwali – Celebrating the triumph of goodness] Hinduism Today (2012)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Jacobi1884&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jean Mead, How and why Do Hindus Celebrate Divali?, ISBN 978-0-237-534-127, pages 8–12&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Yoga]]'', ''[[Vedanta]]'', and ''[[Samkhya]]'' schools of [[Hindu philosophy]] share the belief that there is something beyond the physical body and mind which is pure, infinite, and eternal, called the ''[[Ātman (Hinduism)|Atman]]''. The celebration of Diwali as the &quot;victory of good over evil&quot; refers to the light of higher knowledge dispelling all ignorance, the ignorance that masks one's true nature, not as the body, but as the unchanging, infinite, [[Immanence|immanent]] and [[Transcendence (religion)|transcendent]] reality. With this awakening comes compassion and the awareness of the oneness of all things, and knowledge overcomes ignorance. Diwali is the celebration of this inner light over spiritual darkness,&lt;ref&gt;[http://kids.nationalgeographic.com/kids/stories/peopleplaces/diwali/ Diwali, India's Festival of Light] R.M.

[[File:Ravi Varma-Lakshmi.jpg|thumb|Diwali is celebrated in the honour of [[Lakshmi]], the goddess of wealth.]]
The religious significance of Deepavali varies regionally within India, depending on the school of Hindu philosophy, regional myths, legends, and beliefs.

[[Hindus]] across the world celebrate Diwali in honor of the return of Lord [[Rama]], his wife [[Sita]] and his brother [[Lakshmana]] from exile of 14 years after Rama defeated [[Ravana]]. To honor the return of Lord Rama, Sita and Lakshmana from Lanka and to illuminate their path, villagers light [[Diyas]] to celebrate the triumph of good over evil.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/rama/ry021.htm&lt;/ref&gt; For some, Diwali also celebrates the return of [[Pandavas]] after 12 years of [[Vanvas]] and one year of &quot;Agyatavas&quot; in ''[[Mahabharata]]''. Furthermore, Deepavali is linked to the celebration of [[Lakshmi]], who is venerated amongst Hindus as the goddess of wealth and prosperity and is the wife of Lord [[Vishnu]]. The 5-day festival of Diwali begins on the day Goddess Lakshmi was born from [[Samudra manthan|the churning of cosmic ocean of milk]] by the gods and the demons; while the night of Diwali is the day Lakshmi chose Vishnu as her husband and they were married.&lt;ref name=tp/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Karen Pechilis 2007 pp 273-275&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Pechilis |first1=Karen |year=2007 |title=Guests at God's Wedding: Celebrating Kartik among the Women of Benares |journal=The Journal of Asian Studies |volume=66 |issue=1 |pages=273–5 |doi=10.1017/S0021911807000460}}&lt;/ref&gt; Along with Lakshmi, devotees make offerings to [[Ganesha]], who symbolizes ethical beginnings and fearless remover of obstacles; [[Saraswati]], who embodies music, literature and learning and [[Kubera]], who symbolizes book-keeping, treasury and wealth management.&lt;ref name=tp/&gt; Other Hindus believe that Diwali is the day Vishnu came back to Lakshmi and their abode in the [[Vaikuntha]]; so those who worship Lakshmi receive the benefit of her good mood, and therefore are blessed with mental, physical and material wellbeing during the year ahead.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.indiaexpress.com/faith/festivals/dhistory.html Diwali History] Indian Express (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

Hindus in India's eastern region, such as [[Odisha]] and [[West Bengal]], worship the goddess [[Kali]] instead of Lakshmi, and call the festival [[Kali Puja]].&lt;ref&gt;BUCK, C.

People mark Mount [[Govardhan]], and celebrate legends about Krishna. In other regions, the feast of [[Govardhan Puja]] (or Annakoot) is celebrated, with 56 or 108 different cuisines prepared, offered to Krishna, then shared and celebrated by the local community.

In West and certain Northern parts of India, the festival of Diwali marks the start of a new Hindu year.

===Sikhism===
{{main|Bandi Chhor Divas}}
Diwali for Sikhs marks the Bandi Chhor Divas, when [[Guru Har Gobind]] freed himself and some Hindu [[Rajah]]s, from the [[Gwalior Fort]], from the prison of the Mughal emperor, [[Jahangir]], and arrived at the Golden Temple in Amritsar. Ever since then, Sikhs celebrate ''Bandi Choorh Divas'', with the annual lighting up of [[Harmandir Sahib|Golden Temple]], fireworks and other festivities. In the post-[[Guru Gobind Singh]] era, ''[[Sarbat Khalsa]]'' used to meet on Diwali and [[Baisakhi]] to discuss important issues concerning Sikh community.&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.co.in/books?id=gqIbJz7vMn0C&amp;pg=PA62&amp;lpg=PA62&amp;dq=guru+gobind+singh+diwali+history&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=fQD4xjQGQz&amp;sig=izSHX5krnOzr02IPRPMSWwhKPlA&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CIIBEOgBMBNqFQoTCIfA6IPchckCFYe2jgod3wQLEw#v=onepage&amp;q=guru%20gobind%20singh%20diwali%20history&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jainism===
{{main|Diwali (Jainism)}}
Diwali has special significance in [[Jainism]]. [[Mahavira]], the last of the [[Tirthankar]] of this era, attained [[Nirvana]] on this day at [[Pawapuri|Pavapuri]] on 15 October 527 BCE, on Kartik Krishna Amavasya. According to the ''[[Kalpasutra (Jain)|Kalpasutra]]'' by [[Acharya]] [[Bhadrabahu]], 3rd century BC, many gods were present there, illuminating the darkness.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jacobi1884&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=Sacred Books of the East|volume=22: Gaina Sutras Part I|first=Hermann|last=Jacobi|year=1884}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, Jains celebrate Diwali as a day of remembering Mahavira. On Diwali morning, Nirvan Ladoo is offered after praying to Lord Mahavira in all Jain temples all across the world. Gautam Gandhar Swami, the chief disciple of Lord Mahavira achieved omniscience(Kevala Gyan) later the same day.

===Buddhism===
The [[Newar people|Newar]] people in Nepal, who are Buddhist celebrate the festival through chanting mantras and remembering [[Ashoka]]'s conversion to [[Buddhism]] following the [[Kalinga War]].&lt;ref name=&quot;diwaliBuddhist&quot;/&gt;

==Description and rituals==
Diwali is a five-day festival in many regions of India, with Diwali night centering on the new moon – the darkest night – at the end of the Hindu lunar month of [[Ashvin]] and the start of the month of [[Kartika (month)|Kartika]]. In the Common Era calendar, Diwali typically falls towards the end of October, or first half of November each year. The darkest night of autumn lit with [[Diya (light)|diya]]s, candles and lanterns, makes the festival of lights particularly memorable.&lt;ref&gt;J Gordon Melton, Religious Celebrations: An Encyclopedia of Holidays Festivals Solemn Observances and Spiritual Commemorations, ISBN 978-1598842050, see Diwali, Constance Jones (2011), ABC-CLIO, pp 252–255&lt;/ref&gt; Diwali is also a festival of sounds and sights with fireworks and [[rangoli]] designs; the festival is a major celebration of flavors with feasts and numerous mithai (sweets, desserts),&lt;ref name=jgl/&gt; as well as a festival of emotions where Diwali ritually brings family and friends together every year.&lt;ref name=&quot;dhcd&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Suzanne Barchers 2013&quot;/&gt;

Rituals and preparations for Diwali begin days or weeks in advance. The festival formally begins two days before the night of Diwali, and ends two days thereafter. Each day has the following rituals and significance:&lt;ref name=tp/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Note: there are regional variations, which are explained in a separate section.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.diwalifestival.org/scfi.html Diwali, the festival of lights] Society for the Confluence of Festivals in India (2012)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Lights and Reflections Diwali India November 2013.jpg|thumb|left|On Dhanteras, ''diya'' lights are left burning all night.&lt;ref name=tp/&gt;]]

===Dhanteras (Day 1)===
{{main|Dhanteras}}
Dhanteras (celebrated in Northern and Western part of India) starts off the five day festival. Starting days before and through Dhanteras, houses and business premises are cleaned, renovated and decorated. Women and children decorate entrances with Rangoli – creative colourful floor designs both inside and in the walkways of their homes or offices. Boys and men get busy with external lighting arrangements and completing all renovation work in progress. For some, the day celebrates the churning of cosmic ocean of milk between the forces of good and forces of evil; this day marks the birthday of Lakshmi – the Goddess of Wealth and Prosperity, and the birthday of Dhanvantari – the God of Health and Healing. On the night of Dhanteras, diyas (lamps) are ritually kept burning all through the nights in honor of Lakshmi and Dhanvantari.&lt;ref name=tp/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Karen Pechilis 2007 pp 273-275&quot;/&gt;

Dhanteras is also a major shopping day, particularly for gold or silver articles. Merchants, traders and retailers stock up, put articles on sale, and prepare for this day. [[Lakshmi Puja]] is performed in the evening. Some people decorate their shops, work place or items symbolizing their source of sustenance and prosperity.

===Naraka Chaturdasi (Day 2)===
{{main|Naraka Chaturdashi}}
''Narak Chaturdasi'' is the second day of festivities, and is also called ''Choti Diwali''. The Hindu literature narrates that the asura (demon) Narakasura was killed on this day by Krishna, Satyabhama and Kali. The day is celebrated by early morning religious rituals and festivities followed on. Typically, house decoration and colourful floor patterns called [[rangoli]] are made on or before Narak Chaturdasi. Special bathing rituals such as a fragrant oil bath are held in some regions, followed by minor pujas. Women decorate their hands with henna designs. Families are also busy preparing homemade sweets for main Diwali.&lt;ref name=htoday/&gt;&lt;ref name=tp/&gt;

===Lakshmi Puja (Day 3)===
{{Main|Lakshmi Puja}}
The third day is the main festive day. People wear new clothes or their best outfits as the evening approaches. Then ''diyas'' are lit, pujas are offered to [[Lakshmi]], and to one or more additional deities depending on the region of India; typically [[Ganesha]], [[Saraswati]], and [[Kubera]].&lt;ref name=tp/&gt; Lakshmi symbolises wealth and prosperity, and her blessings are invoked for a good year ahead.&lt;ref&gt;[http://Bandi /www.indiaexpress.com/faith/festivals/dhistory.html Diwali History]&lt;/ref&gt;

Lakshmi is believed to roam the earth on Diwali night. On the evening of Diwali, people open their doors and windows to welcome Lakshmi, and place ''diya'' lights on their windowsills and balcony ledges to invite her in. On this day, the mothers who work hard all year, are recognized by the family and she is seen to embody a part of Lakshmi, the good fortune and prosperity of the household.&lt;ref name=jgl/&gt; Small earthenware lamps filled with oil are lighted and placed in rows by some Hindus along the parapets of temples and houses. Some set ''diyas'' adrift on rivers and streams. Important relationships and friendships are also recognized during the day, by visiting relatives and friends, exchanging gifts and [[South Asian sweets|sweets]].&lt;ref name=htoday/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John Bowker, ed., Oxford Concise Dictionary of World Religions (Oxford UP, 2000), See Festivals&lt;/ref&gt;

After the ''puja'', people go outside and celebrate by lighting up ''patakhe'' (fireworks). The children enjoy [[sparklers]] and variety of small fireworks, while adults enjoy playing with ground chakra, Vishnu chakra, flowerpots (anaar), [[sutli bomb]], rockets and bigger fireworks.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thehindu.com/features/kids/light-up-your-day/article5281060.ece Light up your day] The Hindu (28 October 2013)&lt;/ref&gt; The fireworks signify celebration of Diwali as well a way to chase away evil spirits.&lt;ref name=&quot;Firecracker2&quot;&gt;{{cite book|url = https://books.google.com/?id=GErOyV7FBNUC&amp;pg=PA175&amp;dq=lamps+diwali+evil+spirits#v=onepage&amp;q=lamps%20diwali%20evil%20spirits&amp;f=false|title = Asian American History|first=Valerie|last=Petrillo|publisher=Chicago Review Press|quote=There are firecrackers everywhere to scare off evil spirits and contribute to the festive atmosphere.|accessdate = 26 October 2011|isbn = 978-1-55652-634-3|date = 28 May 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Firecracker3&quot;&gt;{{cite book|url = https://books.google.com/?id=TRyb8XqB7dEC&amp;pg=SA9-PA1&amp;dq=lamps+diwali+evil+spirits#v=onepage&amp;q=lamps%20diwali%20evil%20spirits&amp;f=false|title = The International Holiday &amp; Festival Primer|first=David|last=DeRocco|first2=Joan|last2=Dundas|author3=Ian Zimmerman|publisher=Full Blast Productions|quote=But as well as delighting the spectators, the fireworks are believed to chase away evil spirits.|accessdate = 26 October 2011|isbn = 978-1-895451-24-5|year = 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; After fireworks, people head back to a family feast, conversations and ''[[South Asian sweets|mithai]]'' (sweets, desserts).&lt;ref name=tp/&gt;

===Padwa, Balipratipada (Day 4)===
{{main|Balipratipada}}

The day after Diwali, is celebrated as Padwa. This day ritually celebrates the love and mutual devotion between the wife and husband.&lt;ref name=tp/&gt; The husbands give thoughtful gifts, or elaborate ones to respective spouses. In many regions, newly married daughters with their husbands are invited for special meals. Sometimes brothers go and pick up their sisters from their in-laws home for this important day. The day is also a special day for the married couple, in a manner similar to anniversaries elsewhere in the world. The day after Diwali devotees perform Goverdhan puja in honor of Lord Krishna.

Diwali also marks the beginning of new year, in some parts of India, where the Hindu [[Vikram Samvat]] calendar is popular. Merchants and shopkeepers close out their old year, and start a new fiscal year with blessings from Lakshmi and other deities.

===Bhai Duj, Bhaiya Dooji (Day 5)===
{{main|Bhau-beej}}
The last day of festival is called Bhai dooj (Brother’s second) or Bhai tika in Nepal, where it is the major day of the festival. It celebrates the sister-brother loving relationship, in a spirit similar to [[Raksha Bandhan]] but with different rituals. The day ritually emphasizes the love and lifelong bond between siblings. It is a day when women and girls get together, perform a puja with prayers for the well being of their brothers, then return to a ritual of food-sharing, gift-giving and conversations. In historic times, this was a day in autumn when brothers would travel to meet their sisters, or bring over their sister’s family to their village homes to celebrate their sister-brother bond with the bounty of seasonal harvests.&lt;ref name=tp/&gt;

===Festival of peace===
On this festive occasion, Hindu, Jain and Sikh communities also mark charitable causes, kindness, and for peace. For example, at the international border, every year on Diwali, Indian forces approach Pakistani forces and offer traditional Indian sweets on the occasion of Diwali. The Pakistani soldiers anticipating the gesture, return the goodwill with an assortment of Pakistani sweets.&lt;ref&gt;[http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/diwali-manmohan-singh-amritsar-pranab-mukherjee-hamid-ansari-india-pakistan/1/321508.html Diwali Lights up India] India Today (3 November 2013)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Andhra Pradesh===
In Andhra Pradesh, the festivities center over two days – Naraka Chaturthasi and Deepavali Amaavasya. The festivities start out at the crack of dawn and carry on well into the night. Most people make a trip to the local temple along with their families to seek the blessings of their respective gods. The night sky is lit up with a scintillating array of noisy fireworks.

Diwali is one of the seven most important festivals of [[Andhra Pradesh]]. It is very popular with children who celebrate Diwali because of the excitement of bursting firecrackers. Special shops to sell firecrackers are set up in all towns, cities and bigger villages. Some areas host local stage story telling called Hari Katha. Some areas may put a huge Narakasura dummy made with fireworks. This will be burst by a person dressed as Lord Krishna or, more accurately, a costume of [[Satyabhama]], the consort of [[Lord Krishna]], who actually killed the demon [[Narakasura]]; an event that is celebrated as Diwali for generations. The evening sky of Diwali is a colourful sight to watch.

People clean/white-wash or paint/decorate their homes as it is a very auspicious day; to welcome the goddess of wealth and prosperity i.e. Lakshmi devi to their homes. Homes are lit up with hundreds of diyas and colourful diwali rangolis adorn the doorways. After all this preparation all the members of the family perform the Lakshmi puja. Another custom involves decorating homes with paper figures.

Festivities cut across boundaries to move on from the small villages to the big towns, often beginning almost a month before Diwali. Sales of expensive silk saris, jewellery, ornaments, and household goods increase. From the poor to the rich, everyone indulges in the largest shopping spree of the year. Sweets, which are an integral part of any festival in Andhra Pradesh, are prepared or purchased from shops. The festival is full of messages depicting one or more aspects of human life, relationships, and ancient traditions.

The houses are cleaned and decorated with [[kandeel]](known as ''Akashdivo'' in [[Konkani language|Konkani]]), lamps, mango leaves, and marigold flowers. The utensils are made to shine, filled with water, and decorated for the holy bath the following morning. On the eve of Naraka Charurdashi, paper-made effigies of [[Narakasura]], filled with grass and firecrackers symbolizing evil, are made. These effigies are burnt at around four o'clock in the morning. Firecrackers are burst, and people return home to take a scented oil bath. Lamps are lit in a line.

===Maharashtra===
Preparations for Diwali start before the festival with housewives preparing sweets and savory snacks collectively called 'Faral'. The snacks include ''Chakali, Laddu, Karanji, Chiwada'' and other festive foods.

In [[Maharashtra]], Diwali starts from ''Vasubaras'' which is the 12th day of the 2nd half of the Marathi month ''[[Ashvin]]''. This day is celebrated by performing an ''[[Aarti]]'' of the cow and its calf – which is a symbol of love between mother and her baby.

The next day is ''[[Dhana Trayodashi]]''. Traders and business people give special importance to this festival. It is also considered an auspicious day for making important purchases, especially metals, including kitchenware and precious metals like silver and gold.

The day after ''Naraka Chaturdashi'' comes ''[[Lakshmi-pooja]]''. It occurs on ''Amavasya'' i.e. no moon day. The dark night is illuminated by lamps and at dusk firecrackers are burst. New account books are opened after a ''pooja''. Generally the traders do not make any payments on that day to preserve ''Lakshmi'' in home. In every household, cash, jewellery and an idol of the goddess Lakshmi is worshipped. Friends, neighbours and relatives are invited over and celebrations are in full swing.

===Tamil Nadu===
[[File:படையல்.jpg|thumb|A homemade feast and clothes as gifts on Diwali night.]]

Known as Deepavali (தீபாவளி) in [[Tamil Nadu]], it commemorates the death of [[Narakasura]] at the hands of Lord Sri [[Krishna]]. It is believed that Narakasura, a malevolent demon, tortured common people and they prayed to lord Krishna to defeat him. The people then celebrated Narakasura's defeat with [[sparkler]]s, lights and [[firecracker]]s. This celebration has continued down the generations as Diwali. In Tamil Nadu, Diwali falls on the 14th day preceding the amavasya (new moon) in the solar month of [[Aippasi]].{{citation needed|date=July 2014}} The day begins with an early morning oil bath, wearing new clothes, bursting of firecrackers, visiting Lord [[Ganesha]], Lord [[Vishnu]] and [[Shiva]] temples. The exchange of sweets between neighbours, visiting relations, and preparing Diwali special sweets are traditions of the day.

Typical Deepavali celebrations begin with waking up early in the morning, before sun rise, followed by an oil-bath. The bathing tradition involves extensive massaging of warm til-oil containing pepper corns and betel leaves.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}} New clothes are typically worn as a part of celebrations. After the bath, a home-made medicine known as &quot;Deepavali Lehiyam&quot; is consumed, which is supposed to aid in soothing digestive problems that may ensue because of feasting that occurs later in the day. Sparklers, firecrackers and lights are used extensively, much like the rest of the world where Deepavali is celebrated. Tamil Nadu will celebrate it on the preceding day, [[Naraka Chaturdashi]]. In Tamil Nadu, Diwali is calculated when chaturdashi prevails during sunrise, precisely at 4am-6am. If chaturdashi prevails after 6am it is not considered. For example, if chaturdashi tithi begins at 2:30 pm the preceding day and ends at 1pm next day, the next day will be celebrated as Diwali. Lamps are lit on the night of [[Karthikai Deepam]], in the Tamil solar month of [[Karthikai]].{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}

In different versions, either [[Krishna]] or [[Krishna]]'s wife [[Satyabhama]] killed Narakasura during the [[Dwapara yuga]]. The festival is celebrated over six days. It starts with ''Govatsa Dwadashi''. ''Go'' means cow and ''vatsa'' means calf. ''Dwadashi'' means the 12th day. The story associated with this day is that of King [[Prithu]], son of the tyrant King Vena. Because of the ill rule of Vena, there was a terrible famine and earth stopped being fruitful. Prithu chased the earth, who is usually represented as cow, and ‘milked’ her, meaning that he brought prosperity to the land. On second day, people shop for utensils, clothes, gold and other items. The third day is called ''Chaturdashi'', the day on which the demon Narakasura was killed by Krishna – an incarnation of [[Vishnu]]. It signifies the victory of good over evil and light over darkness. The day is celebrated with puja, fireworks, and feast. The fourth day, is Diwali night, celebrated like rest of India. The fifth day is Govardhan Puja, celebrated as the day [[Krishna]] defeated [[Indra]] by the lifting of [[Govardhana hill]] to save his kinsmen and cattle from rain and floods.

Originally celebrated by imported indentured labourers from the Indian subcontinent during British rule in the then Colony of Fiji during the 19th century, it was set as a holiday at independence in 1970 as the government wished to set aside one religious public holiday each for Fiji's three largest religions, i.e., Christianity, Hinduism and Islam.

The festival celebrates Lakshmi, the goddess of wealth and prosperity, and investment, spending and purchases are considered auspicious.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/937525dc-e33f-11df-97db-00144feabdc0.html#axzz2mQO5gu5S India’s banks face pre-Diwali cash crunch]  James Lamont, The Financial Times (29 October 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/festive-season-consumer-spending-slowing-economy-inflation-retailers/1/321275.html Diwali lights up consumer spending, festive spirit beats inflation] M.G.

==Issues==
There has been growing concern and questions on the environmental and health impact of Diwali, as with other major festivals of the world.

===Air pollution===
One study indicates that air pollution worsens not as much during fireworks, but after fireworks celebration is over, with fine particulate matter ([[PM2.5]]) levels about four times worse than pre-Diwali levels, and average levels about two times a normal day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Barman SC, Singh R, Negi MP, Bhargava SK |title=Fine particles (PM2.5) in ambient air of Lucknow city due to fireworks on Diwali festival |journal=Journal of Environmental Biology |volume=30 |issue=5 |pages=625–32 |date=September 2009 |pmid=20136038}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study indicated that there is high accumulation of PM2.5 generated because of fireworks on Diwali festival which remains suspended in the air. The peak pollution lasts for about one day, and the pollutant concentrations return to background levels after 24 hours.

Another study indicates that ground level ozone pollution is also formed during Diwali.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Attri AK, Kumar U, Jain VK |title=Formation of ozone by fireworks |journal=Nature |volume=411 |issue=6841 |pages=1015 |date=June 2001 |pmid=11429593 |doi=10.1038/35082634}}&lt;/ref&gt; The dispersal and decay times for increased ground level ozone is also about one day.

===Burn injuries===
There is an increase in burn injuries in India during Diwali from fireworks. A firework called ''anar'' (fountain) has been found to cause 65% of the injuries. Adults are the typical victims. Newspapers advise splashing cold water immediately after the burn, which along with proper nursing of the wound helps reduce complications. Most burns are Group I type burns (minor) requiring outpatient care.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Mohan D, Varghese M |title=Fireworks cast a shadow on India's festival of lights |journal=World Health Forum |volume=11 |issue=3 |pages=323–6 |year=1990 |pmid=2291800}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Ahuja RB, Bhattacharya S |title=Burns in the developing world and burn disasters |journal=BMJ |volume=329 |issue=7463 |pages=447–9 |date=August 2004  |pmid=15321905 |pmc=514214 |doi=10.1136/bmj.329.7463.447}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Diwali prayers==

;Prayers
The prayers vary widely by region of India. An example [[Veda|vedic]] prayer from [[Brhadaranyaka Upanishad]] celebrating lights is:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Jha |first1=J.

[[File:MARIANA_DE_MELO.JPG|thumb|upright|Two people wearing shorts. (Argentina, 2011)]]

'''Shorts''' are a [[garment]] worn by both men and women over their [[human pelvis|pelvic]] area, circling the waist and splitting to cover the upper part of the legs, sometimes extending down to the knees but not covering the entire length of the leg. They are called &quot;shorts&quot; because they are a shortened version of [[trousers]], which cover the entire leg. Shorts are typically worn in warm weather or in an environment where comfort and air flow are more important than the protection of the legs.
 
There are a variety of shorts, ranging from knee-length short trousers that can in some situations be worn as formal clothes to beachwear and athletic shorts. Some types of shorts are typically worn by women, such as [[culotte]]s, which are a divided [[skirt]] resembling a pair of loose-cut shorts.

==Terminological differences==
In British English the term &quot;short trousers&quot; has been used, but only for shorts that are a short version of real{{clarify|date=November 2015}} trousers (pants), e.g. tailored shorts, often lined, as typically worn as part of [[school uniform]] for boys up to their early teens,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/short-trousers |title= Short trousers |publisher= Oxford Dictionary}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/history/making_history/makhist10_prog3c.shtml |title= Short trousers for boys |publisher= BBC History}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://ppparchive.durham.gov.uk/photos/picviewer.asp?previous=1550&amp;submit.x=37&amp;submit.y=48 |title= People past and present |publisher= Durham County Council Archives}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by servicemen and policemen in tropical climates. The American term &quot;short pants&quot; is probably the nearest equivalent in the US, there they might now be called &quot;dress shorts&quot;, a term that has not gained much currency in Britain. A somewhat similar garment worn by men in Australia is called &quot;[[Stubbies (brand)|stubbies]]&quot;. &quot;Shorts&quot; is used unqualified in British English to refer to sports shorts, athletic shorts, or casual shorts: the last is nowadays commonplace in warm weather in the UK.

The term &quot;boxer shorts&quot; was an American coinage for a particular kind of men's [[underwear]], and is now common in Britain. However, boxer shorts are often referred to as &quot;boxers&quot; in the USA. The word &quot;pants&quot; refers to outerwear (trousers) in American usage (except when modified to &quot;underpants&quot;) but when used unqualified in British English generally means underwear.

== Sociology ==
{{Refimprove section|date=July 2015}}

=== Europe and America ===
[[File:Leaders welcoming boy into Mexico Scouting.jpg|right|thumb|[[Scouting|Boy Scouts]] wearing shorts. (Mexico, 2010)]]

In much of Europe and the Americas during the 19th and early 20th centuries shorts were worn as outerwear only by young boys until they reached a certain height or maturity. When boys got older, typically around puberty, they would receive their first pair of long trousers. This produced the perception that shorts were only for young boys.  Because of this, men would not wear shorts to avoid looking immature. Women tended not to wear shorts in most cultures, due to social mores: they were expected to wear [[dress]]es, or [[skirt]]s and [[blouse]]s.

In the 1890s, knee pants (an early type of short pants) became the standard wear for American boys. Many urban school portraits from the 1890s show all but the oldest boys wearing knee pants.&lt;ref&gt;[http://histclo.com/schun/country/us/is/chron/19/us-isc1890.html U.S. School Clothes: Individual Schools--The 1890s] at Boys' Historical Clothing School Uniform Pages.&lt;/ref&gt; North American boys normally wore knee pants with short stockings.&lt;ref&gt;[http://histclo.com/Country/us/gar/pants/knee/us-pantk.html North America Boys Garments: Pants--Knee Pants] at Boys' Historical Clothing School Uniform Pages.&lt;/ref&gt; This began to change after the 1900s when North American boys began wearing [[knickerbockers (clothing)|knickerbockers]], while short pants became more popular in Europe. In the 1930s, shorts started to be worn for casual comfort (e.g. outdoor and athletic activities) by both men and women. However, it was still taboo to wear shorts outside certain activities.

Since about the time of [[World War II]], when many soldiers served in tropical locations, adult men have worn shorts more often, especially in summer weather, but the perception of shorts as being only for young boys took several decades to change, and to some extent still exists in certain circles. By the late 20th century however it became common for men to wear shorts as casual wear in summer.

However, in many countries there are few formal settings where wearing shorts would be acceptable, as they are considered casual wear. Notable exceptions where men may wear short trousers to the office or at a formal gathering are South Africa, Bermuda, Australia and New Zealand. Since the 1990s, casual office dress has grown to include formal shorts in some UK and U.S. businesses, but by no means universally.

=== Worldwide ===
Adults are also commonly seen wearing shorts, however wearing shorts is less common among women in traditional eastern countries than in the West, although this varies widely by region - women more often wear shorts in large, cosmopolitan cities. In some countries adult women can be seen wearing loose-fitting shorts that end at or just below the knee, as these are seen as sufficiently modest.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.npr.org/sections/npr-history-dept/2015/04/07/397804245/when-wearing-shorts-was-taboo When wearing shorts was taboo in USA -by www.npr.org ]&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''miniskirt''' (sometimes hyphenated as &quot;mini-skirt&quot;) is a skirt with a [[hemline]] well above the knees, generally at mid-thigh level, normally no longer than {{convert|10|cm|in|0|abbr=on}} below the buttocks;&lt;ref&gt;{{fr}} Sophie George, ''Le Vêtement de A à Z'', ISBN 978-2-9530240-1-2, p.100.&lt;/ref&gt; and a '''minidress''' is a dress with such a hemline. A ''micro-miniskirt'' or '''microskirt''' is a miniskirt with its hemline at the upper thigh.

Short skirts have existed for a long time, though they were generally not called &quot;mini&quot; until after the 1960s. Instances of clothing resembling miniskirts have been identified by archaeologists and historians as far back as c.1390–1370 BCE. In the early 20th century, the dancer [[Josephine Baker]]'s banana skirt that she wore for her mid-1920s performances in the [[Folies Bergère]] was subsequently likened to a miniskirt. Extremely short skirts became a staple of 20th-century science fiction, particularly in 1940s pulp artwork such as that by [[Earle K. Bergey]] who depicted futuristic women in a &quot;stereotyped combination&quot; of metallic miniskirt, bra and boots. Hemlines were just above the knee in 1961, and gradually climbed upward over the next few years. By 1966, some designs had the hem at the upper thigh. Stockings with suspenders were not considered practical with miniskirts and were replaced with coloured tights. The popular acceptance of miniskirts peaked in the &quot;[[Swinging London]]&quot; of the 1960s, and has continued to be commonplace among many women, especially teenagers, pre-teens, and young adults. Before that time, short skirts were only seen in sport and dance clothing, such as skirts worn by female tennis players, figure skaters, cheerleaders, and dancers.

Several designers have been credited with the invention of the 1960s miniskirt, most significantly the London-based designer [[Mary Quant]] and the Parisian [[André Courrèges]].

==Pre-1960==

While very short skirts have existed for a long time, they were generally not called &quot;mini&quot; until after the 1960s. Instances of clothing resembling miniskirts have been identified by archaeologists and historians as far back as c.1390–1370 BCE. This is the date of the [[Egtved Girl]], a [[Nordic Bronze Age]] burial of a young girl who was wearing a short woollen skirt with bronze ornaments that has been compared to a miniskirt.&lt;ref name=&quot;Harding2000&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=A.

One of the earliest known cultures where women regularly wore clothing resembling miniskirts was a subgroup of the [[Miao people]] of China, the Duan Qun Miao ({{zh|c=短裙苗|p= duǎn qún miáo}}, literally &quot;short skirt Miao&quot;).&lt;ref name=norma&gt;{{cite book |last1=Diamond |first1=Norma |editor1-last=Harrell |editor1-first=Stevan |title=Cultural encounters on China's ethnic frontiers|date=1997|publisher=University of Washington Press |location=Seattle |isbn=0-295-97528-8 |pages=98–103|edition=2nd pr. |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=WChrSv86uIsC&amp;pg=PA98 |chapter=Defining the Miao}}&lt;/ref&gt; In albums produced during the [[Qing dynasty]] (1644–1912) from the early eighteenth century onwards to illustrate the various types of Miao, the Duan Qun Miao women were depicted wearing &quot;mini skirts that barely cover the buttocks.&quot;&lt;ref name=norma/&gt; At least one of the &quot;One Hundred Miao Pictures&quot; albums contains a poem that specifically describes how the women's short skirts and navel-baring styles were an identifier for this particular group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Steele|first1=Apollonia|title=Chinese Language Book|url=http://www.ucalgary.ca/lib-old/SpecColl/Chinese/index.html|publisher=University of Calgary library|accessdate=21 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Unknown (pre-1911)|last2=Zhang|first2=Jane (translator)|title=Duan Qun Miao (Mini-Skirt Miao)|url=http://www.ucalgary.ca/lib-old/SpecColl/Chinese/page32.html|publisher=University of Calgary Library|accessdate=21 October 2015|date=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Extremely short skirts became a staple of 20th-century science fiction, particularly in 1940s pulp artwork such as that by [[Earle K.

==1960s==

The manager of an unnamed shop in London's Oxford Street began experimenting in 1960 with skirt hemlines an inch above the knees of window mannequins, and noted how positively his customers responded.&lt;ref&gt;Montreal Gazette, May 28, 1960, page 2&lt;/ref&gt; Hemlines were just above the knee in 1961, and gradually climbed upward over the next few years. By 1966, some designs had the hem at the upper thigh.

Extremely short skirts, some as much as eight inches above the knee, were observed in Britain in the summer of 1962.&lt;ref name=gilmore&gt;{{cite news|last1=Gilmore|first1=Eddie|title=British Girls (Ya! Ya!) Wear Skirts 8 Inches Above Knee|url=http://www.newspapers.com/clip/3454305/independent/|accessdate=16 November 2015|work=Independent (Long Beach, California) |via=[[Newspapers.com]]|date=12 June 1962|page=22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The young women who wore these short skirts were called &quot;Ya-Ya girls,&quot; a term derived from &quot;yeah, yeah&quot; which was a popular [[catcall]] at the time.&lt;ref name=gilmore/&gt; One retailer noted that the fashion for layered net [[crinoline|crinoline petticoats]] raised the hems of short skirts even higher.&lt;ref name=gilmore/&gt; The designer [[Mary Quant]] was quoted as saying that &quot;short short skirts&quot; indicated youthfulness which was seen as desirable, fashion-wise.&lt;ref name=gilmore/&gt;

The earliest known reference to the miniskirt is in a humorous 1962 article datelined Mexico City and describing the &quot;mini-skirt&quot; or &quot;Ya-Ya&quot; as a controversial item of clothing that was the latest thing on the production line there.  The article characterized the miniskirt as stopping eight inches above the knee.  It referred to a writing by a psychiatrist, whose name it did not provide, who had argued that the miniskirt was a youthful protest of international threats to peace.  Much of the article described the reactions of men, who were said to favor the fashion on young women to whom they were unrelated, but to oppose it on their own wives and fiancés.&lt;ref&gt;John Abney, &quot;Yahoo!  The Ya-Ya!&quot; ''Billings Gazette'', Aug. 6, 1962, p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Designer claims===
[[File:Mary Quant in a minidress (1966).jpg|thumb|150px|Mary Quant wearing a minidress, December 1966]]

Several designers have been credited with the invention of the 1960s miniskirt, most significantly the London-based designer [[Mary Quant]] and the Parisian [[André Courrèges]]. Although Quant reportedly named the skirt after her favourite make of car, the [[Mini]],&lt;ref name=miles&gt;{{cite book |last1=Miles |first1=Barry |title=The British invasion: the music, the times, the era |date=2009 |publisher=Sterling |location=New York, NY |isbn=9781402769764 |page=203|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=r8xbaIlrUREC&amp;pg=PA203}}&lt;/ref&gt; there is no consensus as to who designed it first. [[Valerie Steele]] has noted that the claim that Quant was first is more convincingly supported by evidence than the equivalent Courrèges claim.&lt;ref name=steele&gt;{{cite book |last1=Steele |first1=Valerie |title=Fifty years of fashion : new look to now |date=2000 |publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven |isbn=9780300087383 |pages=51–64 |edition=English |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=xqEt6Dpb4TYC&amp;pg=PA52}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the contemporary fashion journalist [[Marit Allen]], who edited the influential &quot;Young Ideas&quot; pages for UK [[Vogue (British magazine)|''Vogue'']], firmly stated that the British designer, [[John Bates (designer)|John Bates]] was the first to offer fashionable miniskirts.&lt;ref name=allen&gt;{{cite web |title=Garments worn by Marit Allen |url=http://www.vam.ac.uk/content/articles/g/garments-worn-by-marit-allen/ |publisher=Victoria and Albert Museum |accessdate=12 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other designers, including [[Pierre Cardin]] and [[Yves Saint Laurent (designer)|Yves Saint Laurent]], had also been raising hemlines at the same time.&lt;ref name=polanc&gt;{{cite book |last1=Polan  |first1=Brenda |last2=Tredre |first2=Roger |title=The great fashion designers |date=2009 |publisher=Berg Publishers |location=Oxford |isbn=9780857851741 |pages=123–125 |edition=English |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=6nevAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA123|chapter=André Courrèges}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Mary Quant
The miniskirt is one of the garments most widely associated with Mary Quant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Horton |first1=Ros |last2=Simmons |first2=Sally|title=Women who changed the world : fifty inspirational women who shaped history |date=2006 |publisher=Quercus |location=London |isbn=9781847240262 |page=170}}&lt;/ref&gt; Quant herself is ambivalent about the claim that she invented the miniskirt, stating that her customers should take credit, as she herself wore very short skirts, and they requested even shorter hemlines for themselves.&lt;ref name=polanq&gt;{{cite book |last1=Polan  |first1=Brenda |last2=Tredre |first2=Roger |title=The great fashion designers |date=2009 |publisher=Berg Publishers |location=Oxford |isbn=9780857851741 |pages=103–105 |edition=English |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=6nevAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA103|chapter=Mary Quant}}&lt;/ref&gt; Regardless of whether or not Quant invented the miniskirt, it is widely agreed that she was one of its highest-profile champions.&lt;ref name=steele/&gt;&lt;ref name=polanc/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Kennedy |first1=Carol |title=From Dynasties to Dotcoms : The Rise, Fall and Reinvention of British Business in the Past 100 Years |date=2003 |publisher=Kogan Page Ltd |location=London |isbn=9780749441272 |page=122 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=9XL5nk5D6woC&amp;pg=PA122}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Quant had started experimenting with shorter skirts in the late 1950s, when she started making her own designs up to stock her boutique on the King's Road.&lt;ref name=polanq/&gt; Among her inspirations was the memory of seeing a young tap-dancer wearing a &quot;tiny skirt over thick black tights,&quot; influencing her designs for young, active women who did not wish to resemble their mothers.&lt;ref name=polanq/&gt; In addition to the miniskirt, Quant is often credited with inventing the coloured and patterned [[tights]] that tended to accompany the garment, although their creation is also attributed to the Spanish couturier [[Cristóbal Balenciaga]] who offered [[harlequin]]-patterned tights in 1962&lt;ref name=jess/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Carter|first=Ernestine|title=The changing world of fashion: 1900 to the present|year=1977|publisher=Weidenfeld and Nicolson|location=London|isbn=9780297773498|pages=213|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?ei=PNn-T8q3GMXV0QXltIC7Bw&amp;id=AkdEAAAAYAAJ&amp;dq=Balenciaga+stockings+patterned&amp;q=Balenciaga+harlequin#search_anchor}}&lt;/ref&gt; or to Bates.&lt;ref name=bates43&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lester|first1=Richard|title=John Bates : fashion designer|date=2008|publisher=ACC Editions|location=Woodbridge, Suffolk|isbn=9781851495702|page=43}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;André Courrèges
Courrèges has explicitly claimed that he invented the mini, and accused Quant of only &quot;commercialising&quot; it.&lt;ref name=steele/&gt; He presented short skirts measuring four inches above the knee in January 1965 for that year's Spring/Summer collection,&lt;ref name=polanc/&gt; although some sources claim that Courrèges had been designing miniskirts as early as 1961, the year he launched his couture house.&lt;ref name=steele/&gt; The collection, which also included [[pantsuit|trouser suits]] and cut-out backs and midriffs, was designed for a new type of athletic, active young woman.&lt;ref name=polanc/&gt; Courrèges had presented &quot;above-the-knee&quot; skirts in the previous year, with his August 1964 haute couture presentation proclaimed the &quot;best show seen so far&quot; for that season by ''[[The New York Times]]''.&lt;ref name=peterson&gt;{{cite news|last1=Peterson|first1=Patricia|title=Courrèges Is Star of Best Show Seen So Far|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1964/08/03/courreges-is-star-of-best-show-seen-so-far.html|accessdate=11 January 2016|work=The New York Times|date=3 August 1964}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Courrèges look, featuring a knit [[bodystocking]] with a [[gabardine]] miniskirt slung around the hips, was widely copied and plagiarised, much to the designer's chagrin, and it would be 1967 before he again held a press showing for his work.&lt;ref name=polanc/&gt; Steele has described Courrèges's work as a &quot;brilliant couture version of youth fashion&quot; whose sophistication far outshone Quant's work, although she champions the Quant claim.&lt;ref name=steele/&gt; Others, such as Jess Cartner-Morley of ''[[The Guardian]]'' explicitly credit him, rather than Quant, as the miniskirt's creator.&lt;ref name=jess&gt;{{cite news|last=Cartner-Morley|first=Jess|title=Chelsea girl who instigated a new era|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2000/dec/02/audreygillan|accessdate=12 July 2012|newspaper=The Guardian|date=2 December 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;John Bates and others
[[File:1965 John Bates for Jean Varon mindress 01.jpg|thumb|150px|John Bates minidress, 1965.

The idea that John Bates, rather than Quant or Courrèges, innovated the miniskirt had an influential champion in [[Marit Allen]], who as editor of the influential &quot;Young Ideas&quot; pages for UK [[Vogue (British magazine)|''Vogue'']], kept track of up-and-coming young designers.&lt;ref name=allen/&gt; In 1966 she chose Bates to design her mini-length wedding outfit in white gabardine and silver [[PVC]].&lt;ref name=allen/&gt; In January 1965 Bates's &quot;skimp dress&quot; with its &quot;short-short skirt&quot; was featured in ''Vogue,'' and would later be chosen as the [[Dress of the Year]].&lt;ref name=bates45&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lester|first1=Richard|title=John Bates : fashion designer|date=2008|publisher=ACC Editions|location=Woodbridge, Suffolk|isbn=9781851495702|page=45}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last=Breward |editor1-first=Christopher |editor2-last=Lister|editor2-first=Jenny|editor3-last=Gilbert|editor3-first=David |title=Swinging sixties : fashion in London and beyond ; 1955 – 1970|date=2006|publisher=V&amp;A Publ. |location=London |isbn=9781851774845 |page=31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dress of the Year walkthrough|url=http://www.fashionmuseum.co.uk/galleries/dress-year |website=Fashion Museum, Bath|publisher=Bath &amp; North East Somerset Council 2015|accessdate=21 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bates was also famous for having designed mini-coats and dresses and other outfits for [[Emma Peel]] (played by [[Diana Rigg]]) in the TV series ''[[The Avengers (TV series)|The Avengers]]'', although the manufacturers blocked his request for patterned tights to enable Emma Peel to fight in skirts if necessary.&lt;ref name=allen/&gt;&lt;ref name=bates43/&gt;

An alternative origin story for the miniskirt came from [[Barbara Hulanicki]] of the London boutique [[Biba]], who recalled that in 1966 she received a delivery of stretchy [[jersey (fabric)|jersey]] skirts that had shrunk drastically in transit. Much to her surprise, the ten-inch long garments rapidly sold out.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Staff writer|title=Barbara Hulanicki and Biba|url=http://www.vam.ac.uk/content/articles/b/biba,-barbara-hulanicki/|publisher=Victoria and Albert Museum|accessdate=21 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1967 [[Rudi Gernreich]] was among the first American designers to offer miniskirts, in the face of strongly worded censure and criticism from American couturiers [[James Galanos]] and [[Norman Norell]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Staff writer|title=Fashion: Up, Up &amp; Away|accessdate=21 October 2015|work=TIME|agency=Time Inc.|date=1 December 1967}}{{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt; Criticism of the miniskirt also came from the Paris couturier [[Coco Chanel]],who declared the style &quot;disgusting&quot; despite being herself famed for supporting shorter skirts in the 1920s.&lt;ref name=steele/&gt;

===Reception===
Owing to Quant's position in the heart of fashionable &quot;[[Swinging London]]&quot;, the miniskirt was able to spread beyond a simple street fashion into a major international trend. The style came into prominence when [[Jean Shrimpton]] wore [[White shift dress of Jean Shrimpton|a short white shift dress]], made by Colin Rolfe, on 30 October 1965 at Derby Day, first day of the annual [[Melbourne Cup]] Carnival in Australia, where it caused a sensation. According to Shrimpton, who claimed that the brevity of the skirt was due mainly to Rolfe's having insufficient material, the ensuing controversy was as much as anything to do with her having dispensed with a hat and gloves, seen as essential accessories in such a conservative society.&lt;ref name=&quot;shrimpton&quot;&gt;Shrimpton, Jean (1990). ''An Autobiography''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;milesago&quot;&gt;Kimball, Duncan (2002-09-12). Jean Shrimpton in Melbourne.

Upper garments, such as rugby shirts, were sometimes adapted as mini-dresses. With the rise in hemlines, the wearing of tights or [[pantyhose]], in place of [[stockings]], became more common. Some European countries &lt;!---which? Must look this up---&gt; banned mini-skirts from being worn in public, claiming they were an invitation to rapists. In response, Quant retorted that there was clearly no understanding of the tights worn underneath.&lt;ref name=&quot;Adburgham&quot;&gt;Adburgham, Alison (1967-10-10). Mary Quant.

===1970s===

From 1969 onwards, the fashion industry largely returned to longer skirts such as the ''midi'' and the ''maxi''. Journalist [[Christopher Booker]] gave two reasons for this reaction: firstly, that &quot;there was almost nowhere else to go ... the mini-skirts could go no higher&quot;; and secondly, in his view, &quot;dressed up in mini-skirts and shiny [[Polyvinyl chloride|PVC]] [[Mackintosh|macs]], given such impersonal names as 'dolly birds', girls had been transformed into throwaway plastic objects&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Booker (1980) ''The Seventies''&lt;/ref&gt; Certainly this lengthening of hemlines coincided with the growth of the [[feminist]] movement.  However, in the 1960s the mini had been regarded as a symbol of liberation, and it was worn by some, such as [[Germaine Greer]] and, in the following decade, [[Gloria Steinem]],.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/1995/09/24/RV65259.DTL | work=The San Francisco Chronicle | title=Making Ms.Story / The biography of Gloria Steinem, a woman of controversy and contradictions | first=Patricia | last=Holt | date=22 September 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; Greer herself wrote in 1969 that:

{{quote|The women kept on dancing while their long skirts crept up, and their [[girdle]]s dissolved, and their nipples burst through like hyacinth tips and their clothes withered away to the mere wisps and ghosts of draperies to adorn and glorify ...&lt;ref&gt;Greer, Germaine (1969-02). Germaine Greer in ''[[Oz (magazine)|Oz]]'', February 1969.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Indeed, miniskirts never entirely went away and, for example, were often worn by [[Debbie Harry|Deborah Harry]], of the group [[Blondie (band)|Blondie]], during the &quot;new wave&quot; of the late 70s. The song &quot;(I Don't Want to Go to) Chelsea&quot; (1978), by new wave artist [[Elvis Costello]], contained the line: &quot;There's no place here for the mini-skirt waddle&quot;.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}

===1980s===
In spring of 1982, (see June ''Time Magazine'') short skirts began to re-emerge, notably in the form of &quot;[[Rah-rah skirt|rah-rahs]]&quot;, which were modeled on those worn by female cheerleaders at sporting and other events. In 1985, the British designer [[Vivienne Westwood]] offered her first &quot;mini-crini,&quot; an abbreviated version of the Victorian [[crinoline]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Staff writer |title=Vivienne Westwood designs |url=http://www.vam.ac.uk/content/articles/v/vivienne-westwood-designs/ |publisher=Victoria and Albert Museum|accessdate=5 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its mini-length, bouffant silhouette inspired the puffball skirts widely presented by more established designers such as [[Christian Lacroix]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cicolini|first1=Alice|last2=British Council|title=Inside out: underwear and style in the UK|date=2000|publisher=Black Dog}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Evans |first1=Caroline |editor1-last=Breward |editor1-first=Christopher |editor2-last=Ehrman |editor2-first=Edwina |editor3-last=Evans |editor3-first=Caroline |title=The London look : fashion from street to catwalk |date=2004 |page=149| publisher=Yale University Press / Museum of London |location=New Haven |isbn=9780300103991 |chapter=Cultural Capital 1976–2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1989, Westwood's mini-crini was described as having combined two conflicting ideals – the crinoline, representing a &quot;mythology of restriction and encumbrance in woman's dress,&quot; and the &quot;equally dubious mythology of liberation&quot; associated with the miniskirt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Evans |first1=Caroline |last2=Thornton |first2=Minna |title=Women and Fashion: A New Look |date=1989 |publisher=Quartet Books |location=London |isbn=9780704326910 |pages=148–150}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the 1980s, many women began to incorporate the miniskirt into their business attire, a trend which grew during the remainder of the century. The titular character of the 1990s television program ''[[Ally McBeal]]'', a lawyer portrayed by [[Calista Flockhart]], has been credited with popularising micro-skirts.&lt;ref name=standring&gt;{{cite news|last1=Standring|first1=Chris|title=Top Trends: Spring’s long skirts flatter every body|url=http://www.edmontonjournal.com/trends+spring+long+skirts+flatter+every+body/10787269/story.html|accessdate=20 October 2015|work=Edmonton Journal|agency=Postmedia Network Inc.|date=2 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1990s onwards===

The very short skirt is an element of Japanese school uniform which since the 1990s has been exploited by young women who are part of the ''[[kogal]]'' (or ''[[gyaru]]'') subculture as part of their look.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Parry|first1=Richard Lloyd|title=Japan's schoolgirls set the trend|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/japans-schoolgirls-set-the-trend-1295844.html|accessdate=26 October 2015|work=The Independent|date=22 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Gyaru'' deliberately wear their skirts short enough to reveal [[panties]] (actually a second pair worn over actual knickers) as a form of exhibitionism known as ''[[panchira]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Miller |first1=Laura |editor1-last=Mathews |editor1-first=Gordon |editor2-last=White |editor2-first=Bruce |title=Japan's Changing Generations: Are Young People Creating a New Society? |date=2012 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=9781134353897 |pages=87–88 |url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=Y4K2D1O5tkQC&amp;pg=PA87|chapter=Youth fashion and beautification}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 21st century micro-minis were once again revived.&lt;ref name=cumming/&gt;&lt;ref name=aniello/&gt; In 2003 [[Tom Ford]], at that time described as one of the few designers able to effortlessly dictate changes in fashion, stated that micro-skirts would be the height of fashion for Spring/Summer 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Staff writer|title=Gucci Spring/Summer 2003 Ready-To-Wear|url=http://www.vogue.co.uk/fashion/spring-summer-2003/ready-to-wear/gucci/catwalk-report|website=Vogue|publisher=Condé Nast|accessdate=20 October 2015|date=29 September 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; For fashionable wear, early 21st century microskirts were often worn with [[leggings]] or [[tights]] in order to avoid revealing too much.&lt;ref name=standring/&gt;&lt;ref name=aniello/&gt; At this time, an even briefer version of the micro-mini emerged, creating a garment sometimes described as a &quot;belt-skirt.&quot;&lt;ref name=aniello&gt;{{cite news |author=Fulvio Aniello |title=Donne con la gonna|url=http://www.fashiontimes.it/2010/11/donne-con-la-gonna/|accessdate=20 October 2015|work=The Fashion Times|publisher=Drawers Media Srl|date=14 November 2010 |language=Italian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Swimwear''' is [[clothing]] designed to be worn by people engaging in a water-based activity or [[List of water sports|water sports]], such as [[human swimming|swimming]], [[diving]] and [[surfing]], or sun-orientated activities, such as [[sun bathing]]. Different types may be worn by men, women, and children. Swimwear is described by a number of names, some of which are used only in particular locations, including '''swimsuit''', '''bathing suit''', '''swimming costume''', '''bathing costume''', '''swimming suit''', '''swimmers''', '''swimming togs''', '''bathers''', '''cossie''' (short for &quot;costume&quot;), or '''swimming trunks''' for men, besides others.

A swimsuit can be worn as an [[undergarment]] in sports that require a wetsuit such as [[water skiing]], [[scuba diving]], [[surfing]], and [[wakeboarding]]. Swimsuits may also be worn to display the wearer's [[physical attractiveness|physical attributes]], as in the case of [[beauty pageant]]s or [[bodybuilding]] contests, and [[glamour photography]] and magazines like the annual ''[[Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue]]'' feature models and sports personalities in swimsuits.

There is a very wide range of styles of modern swimsuits available, which vary as to body coverage and materials. The choice of style may depend on community standards of [[modesty]], as well as current fashions and personal preferences. Swimwear for men usually exposes the chest, while suits for women do not.

==Materials==
[[Rayon]] was used in the 1920s in the manufacture of tight-fitting swimsuits,&lt;ref name=sydelle&gt;{{cite web|last=Sydelle|first=John|title=The Swimsuit Industry|url=http://smallbusiness.chron.com/swimsuit-industry-18779.html |work=The Houston Chronicle |accessdate=August 29, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; but its durability, especially when wet, proved problematic,&lt;!-- Rayon also had the lowest elastic recovery of any fiber.--&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Kadolph&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=Textiles|edition=9|author=Kadolph, Sara J. and Langford, Anna L.|publisher=Prentice Hall|isbn=0-13-025443-6|year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; with [[Jersey (clothing)|jersey]] and [[silk]] also sometimes being used.&lt;ref name=glamoursurf&gt;{{cite web|title=Vintage Swimwear Timeline|url=http://www.glamoursurf.com/swimwear_timeline.html|publisher=Glamoursurf.com|accessdate=August 29, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1930s, new materials were being developed and use in swimwear, particularly [[latex]] and [[nylon]], and swimsuits gradually began hugging the body.&lt;ref name=carnival&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.carnaval.com/bikini/#In%20Brazil |title=History of the Bikini |publisher=Carnival}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Swimsuit styles==
In western culture, men's swimsuit styles include [[boardshorts]], [[jammer (swimwear)|jammers]], [[Trunks (clothing)|swim trunks]], [[swim briefs|briefs]] or &quot;[[Speedo (suit style)|speedos]]&quot;, [[Thong (clothing)|thongs]], and [[g-string]]s, in order of decreasing lower body coverage.

Women's swimsuits are generally described as [[one-piece swimsuit|one-piece]], [[bikini]]s, or [[Thong (clothing)|thong]]s. While they go through many trends in pattern, length and cut there is not much modification to the original variety of suit. A recent innovation is the [[burqini]], favored by some Muslim women, which covers the whole body and head (but not face) in a manner similar to a diver's [[wetsuit]]. These are an updated version of full-body swimwear, which has been [[sea bathing|available for centuries]], but conforms with [[Islam]]'s traditional emphasis on modest dress. In [[Egypt]], the term &quot;[[Sharia]] swimsuit&quot; is used to describe full-body swimwear.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/910379.stm

| valign=&quot;top&quot; | Swim briefs, often made of wool and held in place with a military-style canvas belt at the waist, go back at least to the 1930s.  They can be seen in hundreds of print ads, worn by muscleman [[Charles Atlas]], and were very popular.  Although in a style that today appears similar to underwear [[briefs]], it is likely that the swimwear preceded the underwear,   A nylon version (without the belt), pictured at left, was launched at the [[1956 Summer Olympics|1956 Melbourne Olympics]] by [[Speedo]]. Swim briefs are now often made of a [[nylon]] and [[spandex]] composite, while some longer lasting suits are made from [[polyester]]. The style varies from a full seat to [[Thong (clothing)|thong]] or [[g-string]]. Most swim briefs have a beige or white lining on the inside front made of a similar fabric.

They are usually shorter than  [[boardshorts]] but longer than  [[boxer shorts]]. They feature a polyester liner inside the shorts. Although trunks have been used as swimwear since the 1940s, their heyday was in 1990s when they were highly popularised thanks in part to TV shows like ''[[Baywatch]]''. Today, they have been eclipsed by boardshorts among teenagers and young adults. They remain the norm with older age groups and young children.

In other cultures (particularly the UK) the term 'trunks' is used to describe swim briefs, although it has been increasingly common for any men's swimwear to be generically described as 'trunks'.

==Body coverage==

Swimsuits can be [[skin-tight clothing|skin-tight]] or loose-fitting. They are often lined with another layer of fabric if the outer fabric becomes [[transparency (optics)|transparent]] when wet.

Swimsuits range from designs that almost completely cover the body to designs that expose almost all of the body. The choice of swimsuit will depend on personal and community standards of [[modesty]] and on considerations such as how much or how little [[Sun protective clothing|sun protection]] is desired, and prevailing [[Fashion#Clothing|fashion]]s. Almost all swimsuits cover the [[genitals]] and [[pubic hair]], while most except [[Thong (clothing)|thongs]] or [[G-string]] cover much or all of the [[buttocks]]. &lt;ref name=menkes&gt;Suzy Menkes, &quot;[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F0CE7D81430F93BA25754C0A965958260&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=2 Runways: Remembrance of Thongs Past]&quot;, ''The New York Times'', July 18, 1993&lt;/ref&gt; 

Most swimsuits in [[western culture]] leave at least the head, shoulders, arms, and lower part of the leg (below the knee) exposed. Women's swimsuits generally cover at least the [[aereola]] and bottom half of the [[breast]]s, but some are designed for the top part of the swimsuit to be removed. In many countries, young girls and sometimes women choose not to wear a swimsuit top, and this can vary with the occasion, location, age, etc. 

Both men and women may sometimes wear swimsuits covering more of the body when swimming in cold water (see also [[wetsuit]] and [[dry suit]]). In colder temperatures, the swimwear is needed to conserve body heat and protect the body core from hypothermia.

==Swimwear and hygiene==
Germs, bacteria, and mold can grow very quickly on wet bathing suits. Medical professionals warn that wearing damp swimwear for long periods of time can cause a number of infections and rashes in children and adults, and warn against sharing bathing suits with others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.essortment.com/child-safety-public-swimming-pool-49723.html|title=Child Safety: Public Swimming Pool|date=16 May 1986|work=Essortment}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cdc.gov/healthywater/hygiene/disease/hot_tub_rash.html|title=Hot Tub Rash - Hygiene-related Diseases - Hygiene - Healthy Water - CDC|work=cdc.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; They suggest that changing out of a wet bathing suit right away can help prevent vaginal infections and itching in females&lt;ref name=Drexel&gt;Nyirjesy and Bayer [http://www.drexelmed.edu/Home/HealthEncyclopediaArticles/DiseasesandConditions/Vaginalyeastinfection.html Vaginal yeast infection], Drexel University College of Medicine&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Medline&gt;[http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/003159.htm Vaginal itching].

In public swimming pools in France for reasons of hygiene, it is only permitted to wear closer fitting styles of swimwear. Men, for instance,  must wear &quot;Speedo&quot; style bathing suits and not baggy shorts or trunks.&lt;ref&gt;Marsh, Janine.

== History ==
{{main|History of swimwear}}

===Pre-20th century===
[[Image:Bathing suit 1858.png|thumb|150px|1858 Woman's bathing suit]]
In [[classical antiquity]] swimming and bathing were done naked. There are Roman murals which show women playing sports and exercising wearing two-piece suits covering the areas around their breasts and hips in a fashion remarkably similar to the present-day bikini. However, there is no evidence that they were used for swimming. All classical pictures of swimming show nude swimmers.

In various cultural traditions one swims, if not in the nude, in a version in suitable material of a garment or undergarment commonly worn on land, e.g. a [[loincloth]] such as the Japanese man's [[fundoshi]].

In the United Kingdom until the mid-19th century there was no law against nude swimming, and each town was free to make its own laws. For example, the [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]] Corporation official bathing dress code of 1737 prescribed, for men:

&lt;blockquote&gt;It is Ordered Established and Decreed by this Corporation that no Male person above the age of ten years shall at any time hereafter go into any Bath or Baths within this City by day or by night without a Pair of [[Undergarment|Drawers]] and a [[Waistcoat]] on their bodies.&lt;ref name=Bath&gt;Quoted in Byrde, Penelope. &quot;That Frightful Unbecoming Dress: Clothes for Spa Bathing at Bath&quot;, Costume, No 21, 1987, p.50&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In rivers, lakes, streams and the sea men swam in the nude, where the practice was common. Those who didn't swim in the nude, stripped to their underwear. The English practice of men swimming in the nude was banned in the United Kingdom in 1860. Drawers, or [[caleçon]]s as they were called, came into use in the 1860s. Even then there were many who protested against them and wanted to remain in the nude. [[Francis Kilvert]] described men's bathing suits coming into use in the 1870s as &quot;a pair of very short red and white striped drawers&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Cec Cinder, PhD: ''The Nudist Idea'', Ultraviolet Press, Riverside, California: 1998, p. 333. ISBN 978-0-9652085-0-5&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Punch - Masculine beauty retouched1.png|thumb|Cartoon by [[George du Maurier]] in ''[[Punch (magazine)|Punch]]'', 1877, showing men's and children's bathing suits]]
Female bathing costumes were derived from those worn at Bath and other spas. It would appear that until the 1670s nude female bathing in the spas was the norm and that after that time women bathed clothed. Celia Fiennes gave a detailed description of the standard ladies' bathing costume in 1687:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The Ladyes go into the bath with Garments made of a fine yellow canvas, which is stiff and made large with great sleeves like a parson’s gown; the water fills it up so that it is borne off that your shape is not seen, it does not cling close as other linning, which Lookes sadly in the poorer sort that go in their own linning. The Gentlemen have drawers and wastcoates of the same sort of canvas, this is the best linning, for the bath water will Change any other yellow.&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Byrde, Penelope. &quot;That Frightful Unbecoming Dress: Clothes for Spa Bathing at Bath&quot;, Costume, No 21, 1987, pp.48–9&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Bath Corporation official bathing dress code of 1737 prescribed, for women:

&lt;blockquote&gt;No Female person shall at any time hereafter go into a Bath or Baths within this City by day or by night without a decent [[Chemise|Shift]] on their bodies.&lt;ref name=Bath /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

''The Expedition of Humphrey Clinker'' was published in 1771 and its description of ladies’ bathing costume is different from that of Celia Fiennes a hundred years earlier:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The ladies wear jackets and petticoats of brown linen, with chip hats, in which they fix their handkerchiefs to wipe the sweat from their faces; but, truly, whether it is owing to the steam that surrounds them, or the heat of the water, or the nature of the dress, or to all these causes together, they look so flushed, and so frightful, that I always turn my eyes another way.&lt;ref&gt;The Expedition of Humphrey Clinker, pp.68–9&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Penelope Byrde points out that Smollett’s description may not be accurate, for he describes a two-piece costume, not the one piece shift or smock that most people describe and is depicted in contemporary prints. His description does, however, tally with Elizabeth Grant’s description of the guide’s costume at Ramsgate in 1811. The only difference is in the fabric the costumes are made of. Flannel, however, was a common fabric for sea bathing costumes as many believed the warmer fabric was necessary in cold water.&lt;ref name=Austen&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jasa.net.au/seaside/Bathing.htm|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20130514035307/http://www.jasa.net.au/seaside/Bathing.htm|title=Bathing - Jane Austen at the seaside|archivedate=14 May 2013|work=jasa.net.au}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 18th century women wore &quot;bathing gowns&quot; in the water; these were long dresses of fabrics that would not become transparent when wet, with weights sewn into the hems so that they would not rise up in the water. The men's swim suit, a rather form-fitting wool garment with long sleeves and legs similar to long [[underwear]], was developed and would change little for a century.

In the 19th century, the woman's double suit was common, comprising a gown from shoulder to knees plus a set of trousers with leggings going down to the ankles.

In the [[Victorian era]], popular beach resorts were commonly equipped with [[bathing machine]]s designed to avoid the exposure of people in swimsuits, especially to people of the opposite sex.

In the United States, [[beauty pageant]]s of women in bathing costumes became popular from the 1880s. However, such events were not regarded as  respectable. Beauty contests became more respectable with the first modern &quot;[[Miss America]]&quot; contest held in 1921, though less respectable beauty contests continued to be held.

===20th century===
{{refimprove section|date=August 2013}}
[[Image:Annette Kellerman1.jpg|upright|thumb|[[Annette Kellerman]] in her one-piece bathing suit]]
[[Image:BathingMachineDontBeAfraid.jpg|thumb|Man and woman in swimsuits, c.1910; she is exiting a [[bathing machine]]]]

In 1907, the swimmer [[Annette Kellerman]] from [[Australia]] visited the United States as an &quot;underwater ballerina&quot;, a version of [[synchronized swimming]] involving diving into glass tanks. She was arrested for [[indecent exposure]] because her swimsuit showed arms, legs and the neck. Kellerman changed the suit to have long arms and legs and a collar, still keeping the close fit that revealed the shapes underneath. She later starred in several [[film|movies]], including one about her life. She marketed a line of bathing suits and her style of one-piece suits came to be known as &quot;the Annette Kellerman&quot;. The Annette Kellerman was considered the most offensive style of swimsuit in the 1920s and became the focus of censorship efforts.&lt;ref name=&quot;www1.assumption.edu&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www1.assumption.edu/ahc/vanities/default.html |title=Vanities |publisher=.assumption.edu |date= |accessdate=2013-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Meagan Hess |url=http://xroads.virginia.edu/~ma04/hess/fashion/inthiscorner3.html |title=Skirting the Skirts at the Bathing Beach |publisher=Xroads.virginia.edu |date= |accessdate=2013-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite opposition from some groups, the form-fitting style proved popular. It was not long before swimwear started to shrink further. At first arms were exposed and then legs up to mid-thigh. Necklines receded from around the neck down to around the top of the bosom. The development of new fabrics allowed for new varieties of more comfortable and practical swimwear.&lt;ref&gt;http://modadellacqua.com/blogs/news/32188611-history-of-male-swimwear-the-origins-of-the-bathing-suit-1880-1930-modesty-and-transgression&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to the figure-hugging nature of these garments, [[glamour photography]] since the 1940s and 1950s has often featured people wearing swimsuits. This type of glamour photography eventually evolved into swimsuit photography exemplified by the annual ''[[Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue]]''. Beauty contests also required contestants to wear form-fitting swimsuits.

The first [[bikinis]] appeared just after [[World War II]]. Early examples were not very different from the women's two pieces common since the 1920s, except that they had a gap below the breast line allowing for a section of bare midriff. They were named after [[Bikini Atoll]], the site of several nuclear weapons tests, for their supposed explosive effect on the viewer.

Through the 1950s, it was thought proper for the lower part of the bikini to come up high enough to cover the [[navel]]. From the 1960s on, the bikini shrank in all directions until it sometimes covered little more than the nipples and genitalia, although less revealing models giving more support to the breasts remained popular. At the same time, [[fashion designer]] [[Rudi Gernreich]] introduced the [[monokini]], a topless suit for women consisting of a modest bottom supported by two thin straps. Although not a commercial success, the suit opened eyes to new design possibilities. In the 1980s the [[thong (bikini, underwear)|thong]] or &quot;tanga&quot; came out of [[Brazil]], said to have been inspired by traditional garments of native tribes in the [[Amazon Basin|Amazon]]. However, the one-piece suit continued to be popular for its more modest approach.

Men's swimsuits developed roughly in parallel to women's during this period, with the shorts covering progressively less. Eventually racing-style &quot;speedo&quot; suits became popular&amp;mdash;and not just for their speed advantages.  [[Thong (clothing)|Thongs]], [[G-strings]], and [[bikini]] style suits are also worn. Typically these are more popular in more [[tropical]] regions; however, they may also be worn at public [[swimming pools]] and inland lakes. But in the 1990s, longer and baggier shorts became popular, with the hems often reaching to the knees. Often called boardshorts and swim trunks, these were often worn lower on the hips than regular shorts.

==Alternatives to swimsuits==
Since the early twentieth century a [[naturist]] movement has developed in western countries that seeks a return to non-sexual nakedness  when swimming and during other appropriate activities.&lt;ref name=BNWeb &gt;{{Citation | last = | first =|  title = British Naturism (BN)| date = | year = | url = http://www.bn.org.uk/pages/pages.asp?page_Id=3| issn= 0264 0406 |accessdate = 2011-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some women prefer to engage in water or sun activities with their torso uncovered. The practice is often described as &quot;[[toplessness]]&quot; or &quot;[[topfreedom]]&quot;.  In some places around the world, [[nude beach]]es have been set aside for people who choose to engage in normal beach activities in the nude.

As an alternative to a swimsuit, some people wear [[trousers]], [[underpants]] or a [[T-shirt]] either as a makeshift swimsuit or because they prefer [[Wetlook|regular clothes over swimsuits]]. In some countries, such as Thailand and Philippines, swimming in regular clothes is the norm while swimsuits are rare. At beaches, this may be more accepted than at swimming pools, which tend not to permit the use of underwear as swimwear&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elpasotexas.gov/parks/_documents/Appendix%20D%20-%20Swimming%20Pool%20Rules.pdf|format=PDF|title=El Paso, Texas, swimming pool rules Rules for swimmers. See rule 1|website=elpasotexas.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;  because underwear is unlined, may become translucent, and may be perceived as unclean.

[[Image:Conference table.jpg|thumb|Meetings are sometimes held around [[conference room|conference]] [[Furniture#Table|table]]s.]]

In a '''meeting''', two or more people come together to discuss one or more topics, often in a formal setting. 

== Definitions ==

[[File:2screensystem.jpg|thumb|A modern [[videoconferencing]] system]]

One Merriam-Webster dictionary defines a meeting as &quot;an act or process of coming together&quot; - for example &quot;as [...] an assembly for a common purpose [...]&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;pu&quot;&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/meeting Meeting – Definition and More from the Free Merriam-Webster Dictionary]. (n.d.). Dictionary and Thesaurus – Merriam-Webster Online. Retrieved 2016-02-04.&lt;/ref&gt;

A meeting is a gathering of two or more people that has been convened{{by whom?|date=February 2016}} for the purpose of achieving a common goal through verbal interaction, such as sharing information or reaching agreement.&lt;ref name=&quot;pi&quot;/&gt; Meetings may occur face-to-face or virtually, as mediated by communications technology, such as a [[conference call|telephone conference call]], a [[Skype|skyped conference call]] or a [[videoconferencing|videoconference]].

One can distinguish a meeting from other gatherings, such as a chance encounter (not convened), a sports game or a concert (verbal interaction is incidental), a party or the company of friends (no common goal is to be achieved) and a demonstration (whose common goal is achieved mainly through the number of demonstrators present, not through verbal interaction).

[[Meeting planner]]s and other meeting [[professional]]s may use the term &quot;meeting&quot; to denote an event booked at a hotel, [[convention center]] or any other venue dedicated to such gatherings.&lt;ref name=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;[http://www.bls.gov/oco/ocos298.htm Meeting and Convention Planners]. (2009, December 17). U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. Retrieved April 21, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;
In this sense, the term &quot;meeting&quot; covers a [[lecture]] (one presentation), [[seminar (disambiguation) | seminar]] (typically several presentations, small audience, one day), [[conference (disambiguation) | conference]] (mid-size, one or more days), [[congress]] (large, several days), [[trade fair | exhibition or trade show]] (with manned stands being visited by passers-by), [[Workshop (disambiguation) | workshop]] (smaller, with active participants), training [[course (disambiguation) | course]], [[team-building session]] and [[Kickoff meeting | kick-off event]].

== Types of meetings ==

[[Image:Conferenceroom2.JPG|thumb|Meetings are often held in [[conference room]]s]]

[[File:Training meeting in a ecodesign stainless steel company in brazil.JPG|thumb|Training meeting about [[sustainable design]]. The photo shows a training meeting with factory workers in a [[stainless steel]] [[ecodesign]] company from [[Rio de Janeiro]], [[Brazil]].]]

Common types of meeting include:
* [[Ad hoc]] meeting, a meeting called for a special purpose 
* [[Board of directors|Board]] meeting, a meeting of the [[Board of directors]] of an organization
* Investigative Meeting, generally when conducting a pre-interview, exit interview or a meeting among the investigator and representative
* [[Kickoff meeting]], the first meeting with the project team and the client of the project to discuss the role of each team member
* Management meeting, a meeting among managers
* Off-site meeting, also called &quot;offsite retreat&quot; and known as an [[Awayday]] meeting in the UK
* One-on-one meeting, between two individuals
* Pre-Bid Meeting, a meeting of various competitors and or contractors to visually inspect a jobsite for a future project.  The meeting is normally hosted by the future customer or engineer who wrote the project specification to ensure all bidders are aware of the details and services expected of them.  Attendance at the Pre-Bid Meeting may be mandatory.  Failure to attend usually results in a rejected bid
* Staff meeting, typically a meeting between a manager and those that report to the manager
* [[Stand-up meeting]], a meeting with attendees typically standing. The discomfort of standing for long periods helps to keep the meetings short.
* Team meeting, a meeting among colleagues working on various aspects of a team project
* Work Meeting, which produces a product or intangible result such as a decision

== Meeting frequency options ==
Since a meeting can be held once or often, the meeting organizer has to determine the repetition and frequency of occurrence of the meeting. Options generally include the following:
* A ''one-time meeting'' is the most common meeting type and covers events that are self-contained. While they may repeat often, the individual meeting is the entirety of the event. This can include a 2006 conference. The 2007 version of the conference is a stand-alone meeting event.
* A ''recurring meeting'' is a meeting that recurs periodically, such as an every Monday staff meeting from 9:00AM to 9:30 AM. The meeting organizer wants the participants to be at the meeting on a constant and repetitive basis. A recurring meeting can be ongoing, such as a weekly team meeting, or have an end date, such as a 5-week training meeting, held every Friday afternoon.
* A ''series meeting'' is like a recurring meeting, but the details differ from meeting to meeting. One example of a series meeting is a monthly &quot;lunch and learn&quot; event at a company, church, club or organization. The placeholder is the same, but the agenda and topics to be covered vary. This is more of a recurring meeting with the details to be determined.

[[File:Biskeri- Camping I IMG 7238.jpg|thumb|Camping in the [[Kullu District]] of [[Himachal Pradesh]], [[India]]]]

'''Camping''' is an elective [[outdoor activity|outdoor recreational]] activity. Generally held, participants leave developed areas to spend time outdoors in more natural ones in pursuit of activities providing them enjoyment.  To be regarded as &quot;camping&quot; a minimum of one night is spent outdoors, distinguishing it from day-tripping, picnicking, and other similarly short-term recreational activities.  Camping can be enjoyed through all four seasons.

Camping may involve sheltering in the open air, a [[tent]], [[Travel trailer|caravan]], [[motorhome]], or   primitive structure.  Luxury may be an element, as in early 20th century African [[safari]]s, but including accommodations in fully equipped fixed structures such as high-end [[sporting camp]]s under the banner of &quot;camping&quot; blurs the line.

Camping as a recreational activity became popular among elites in the early 20th century. With time, it grew more democratic, and varied. Modern participants frequent [[protected area|publicly owned natural resources]] such as [[national park|national]] and state parks, [[wilderness area]]s, and commercial campgrounds. Camping is a key part of many youth organizations around the world, such as [[Scouting]], which use it to teach both self-reliance and teamwork.

==Definition==
[[File:Unidentified group of men camping.jpg|thumb|Camping in [[Ontario]], circa 1907]]

Camping describes a range of activities and approaches to outdoor accommodation. [[Survivalist]] campers set off with as little as possible to get by, whereas [[recreational vehicle]] travelers arrive equipped with their own electricity, heat, and patio furniture. Camping may be combined with [[hiking]], as in [[backpacking (wilderness)|backpacking]], and is often enjoyed in conjunction with other outdoor activities such as [[canoeing]], [[climbing]], [[fishing]], and [[hunting]].

There is no universally held definition of what is and what is not camping.  Fundamentally, it reflects a combination of ''intent'' and the nature of activities involved.  A children's [[summer camp]] with dining hall meals and bunkhouse accommodations may have &quot;camp&quot; in its name but fails to reflect the spirit and form of &quot;camping&quot; as it is broadly understood.  Similarly, a [[homelessness|homeless]] person's lifestyle may involve many common camping activities, such as sleeping out and preparing meals over a fire, but fails to reflect the elective nature and pursuit of spirit rejuvenation that are integral aspect of camping.  Likewise, cultures with itinerant lifestyles or lack of permanent dwellings cannot be said to be &quot;camping&quot;, it is just their way of life.

==History==
{{globalize/UK|date=October 2013}}
[[File:Thomas Hiram Holding.jpg|thumb|[[Thomas Hiram Holding]] outside his camping tent.]]
The history of recreational camping is often traced back to [[Thomas Hiram Holding]], a British travelling tailor, but it was actually first popularised in the UK on the [[river Thames]]. By the 1880s large numbers of visitors took part in the pastime, which was connected to the late Victorian craze for pleasure boating. The early camping equipment was very heavy, so it was convenient to transport it by boat or to use craft that converted into tents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Wenham|first=S. M.|title=The River Thames and the Popularisation of Camping, 1860–1980|url=http://www.oxoniensia.org|work=[[Oxoniensia]] LXXX|date=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although [[Thomas Hiram Holding]] is often seen as the father of modern camping in the UK, he was responsible for popularising a different type of camping in the early twentieth century. He experienced the activity in the wild from his youth, when he had spent much time with his parents traveling across the American prairies. Later he embarked on a cycling and camping tour with some friends across [[Ireland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Wills|first=Dixe|title=Camping? It should be about the simple life|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/travel/2011/apr/16/campsites-outdoors-dixe-wills|accessdate=24 July 2011|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|date=16 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; His book on his Ireland experience, ''Cycle and Camp in Connemara'' led to the formation of the first camping group in 1901, the Association of Cycle Campers, later to become the [[Camping and Caravanning Club]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Thomas Hiram Holding|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/269179/Thomas-Hiram-Holding|work=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]|accessdate=24 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote ''The Campers Handbook'' in 1908, so that he could share his enthusiasm for the great outdoors with the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Thomas Hiram Holding|url=http://www.npg.org.uk/collections/search/person/mp103685/thomas-hiram-holding|publisher=[[National Portrait Gallery, London]]|accessdate=24 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Possibly the first commercial camping ground in the world was [[Cunningham's Camp Escalator|Cunningham’s camp]], near [[Douglas, Isle of Man]], which opened in 1894. In 1906 the Association of Cycle Campers opened its first own camping site, in [[Weybridge]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Club History|url=http://www.campingandcaravanningclub.co.uk/aboutus/history/|publisher=[[Camping and Caravanning Club]]|accessdate=24 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; By that time the organization had several hundred members. In 1910 the Association was merged into the National Camping Club. Although WW1 was responsible for a certain hiatus in camping activity, the association received a new lease of life after the war when [[Sir Robert Baden-Powell]] (founder of the [[Scouting|Boy Scouts movement]]) became its president.

The International Federation of Camping Clubs (Federation Internationale de Camping et de Caravanning) was founded in 1932 with national clubs from all over the world affiliating with it. By the 1960s camping had become an established family holiday standard and today camp sites are ubiqitous across [[Europe]] and [[North America]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.talkcamping.co.uk/guides/history_of_camping.html |title=Guide |publisher=talkCamping |date= |accessdate=2013-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Forms==

===Adventure camping===

Adventure camping is a form of camping by people who race (possibly adventure racing or [[mountain biking]]) during the day, and camp in a minimalist way at night. They might use the basic items of camping equipment such as a micro-camping stove, [[sleeping bag]], and [[bivouac bag]].

===Dry camping===
Dry camping is camping at a site without a reliable preexisting water source; such locations are known as ''dry camps''. Campers must carry their own water in and out of camp, which requires much more preparation than would otherwise be required. Dry camping is very common in deserts, and is often preferred due to the risk of flash floods.

===Backpacking===
{{main|Backpacking (wilderness)}}
[[File:Hikers with packs.jpg|thumb|[[backpacking (wilderness)|Backpackers]] carrying camping equipment]]

[[Backpacking (wilderness)|Backpacking]] affords a maximum wilderness experience. Specialized gear allows enthusiasts to both enjoy popular local recreational spots and access the most remote locations.

Technological advance and consumer interest in camping have led to lighter and more diverse backpacking gear. Improvements such as titanium cookware, ultra-light wicking fabrics, and heat-molded hip straps make for lighter loads and enhanced performance. As there is always the possibility of severe weather and injury in the [[backcountry]], cell and [[satellite phone]]s are sometimes carried for emergencies, with varying coverage.

Backpacking may involve riding or being accompanied by [[pack animal]]s such as horses, mules, and llama. These increase carrying capacity at the expense of trail condition.

* [[Ultralight backpacking]] enthusiasts bring as little as possible while camping, inherently producing a smaller footprint and minimalized impact on a wilderness environment. The choice to camp with less, or even the minimum necessary to survive, may be a matter of preference (where it may overlap with &quot;survivalist&quot; style camping) or reflect the activity being pursued. Camping while engaging in such back-country activities as [[rock climbing]] and [[cross-country skiing]] puts a premium on the amount of gear that can effectively be carried, thus lending to a less rather than more approach.

===Canoe Camping===
* [[Canoe camping]] is similar to backpacking, and often affords much more weight and bulk to be carried when extended [[portage|portaging]] is not involved. [[Electric motor]]s or small gas ones may be attached on some canoes, where allowed, for a faster journey on the water. Waterproof bags and fishing gear are common gear.

===Bicycle Camping===
* [[bicycle touring|Bicycle camping]] combines camping with cycling, both in developed and natural areas.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=LQEAAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA112&amp;dq=popular+science+1930&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=zOkDT4znGcrZgQev-ZywAg&amp;ved=0CE8Q6AEwBzhu#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=true &quot;Try Bike Camping&quot;] ''Popular Science'', October 1975, pp. 112–113&lt;/ref&gt; A form of bicycle camping that has become popular in some parts of the world involves cycling organisations offering organised multi-day rides and providing riders with facilities and luggage transport. The [[Great Victorian Bike Ride]] in Australia is one of the oldest and most successful examples of this, operating since 1984 and involving thousands of riders on a nine-day journey of around {{convert|550|km|mi}} each year.&lt;ref name=viconline-gvbr&gt;{{cite web|title=Great Victorian Bike Ride |url=http://www.vic.gov.au/event/2011/11/great-victorian-bike-ride.html |work=Victoria Online |publisher=[[State Government of Victoria]] |accessdate=27 December 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/20110819025541/http://www.vic.gov.au:80/event/2011/11/great-victorian-bike-ride.html |archivedate=August 19, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Motorcycle]] camping is more similar to bicycle camping than car camping due to limited storage capacity. Lightweight, compact backpacking equipment is used.

===Car, Off-Road, and RV===
[[File:Car Camping.jpg|thumb|&quot;Car camping&quot; is camping facilitated by a motor vehicle]]
These forms of camping involve using a powered vehicle as an essential element of the camping experience.

===Glamping===
{{main|Glamping}}

Glamping (glamorous camping) is a growing global phenomenon that combines camping with the luxury and amenities of a home or hotel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://travel.usatoday.com/destinations/story/2011/08/Go-glamping-in-the-Ohio-Wilds/49819754/1| title='Glamping' brings creature comforts to outdoors|date=2011-08-04|accessdate= 2015-11-27 |work=USA Today |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131206162540/http://travel.usatoday.com/destinations/story/2011/08/Go-glamping-in-the-Ohio-Wilds/49819754/1 |archive-date=Dec 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its roots are in the early 1900s European and American  [[safari]]s in Africa.  Wealthy travellers accustomed to comfort and luxury did not want to sacrifice either, and their campsites and pampered wilderness lifestyles reflected it.

===Reenactment camping===
[[File:French and Indian War reenactment.jpg|thumb|Modern-day [[reenactor]]s of the 18th century [[French and Indian War]] sleep in period tents and cook on campfires]]

Reenactment camping employs the methods and equipment appropriate to a specific historic era for personal enjoyment and other purposes such as instruction and entertainment. [[Historical reenactors]] seek to replicate the conditions and technologies of such periods as the [[Wild West]], [[American Civil War]], and [[Medieval|Medieval times]].

===Social camping===
{{original research|section|date=February 2015}}
[[File:Hattingen (Ruhrbrücke Kosterstraße) 07 ies.jpg|thumb|Long-term campsites include permanent and semi-permanent setups and can lead to closer relationships with neighboring campers]]
Many campers enjoy socializing with small groups of fellow campers. Such groups will arrange events throughout the year to allow members with similar interests or from similar geographical areas in order to collaborate. This allows [[families]] to form small close-knit [[societies]], and children to form lasting [[friendship]]s. There are two large organizations in the UK who facilitate this sort of camping: the [[Caravan Club]] and the [[Camping and Caravanning Club]].

Some who participate in this sort of camping feel that it brings a closer form of bonding, as members become more mutually dependent than they would otherwise be in [[modern society]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.archive.org/web/20100530092748/http://www.camping.gl/camping_equipment_social_camping.html| title=Social Camping|date=|accessdate= 2010-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Social camping can also build more of a bond between members of the same [[family]] and between different families. It is common for many campers to organize this type of activities with their friends or neighbors. Social camping goes beyond uniting families and it may also give the opportunity for lonely campers to enjoy this type of activity with individuals who share their enthusiasm in this matter.

Because of the bonding this type of camping promotes, it can also be used as a personnel training facility. In fact, many [[companies]] offer their [[Employees#Employee|employees]] this type of training because it helps connect people who do not necessarily know each other but who need to work in the same environment and need to get along successfully. Including this type of activity in a personnel training package is becoming more and more popular and it is also recommended because of the benefits it brings.

In more recent years, those who camp alone have been able to share their experiences with other campers, through [[blogs]] and [[online]] [[social networking]]. There are many online websites especially designed for people who are looking for camping companions or for those who only want to share their experiences with other people. In this case, campers may provide the others with useful tips resulting from their own experience. Individuals who are willing to camp are likely to access this type of websites and connect with other campers, especially if they are novices, because it gives them the opportunity to learn more about this activity.

===Survivalist camping===

[[Survivalist]] campers learn the [[Survival skills|skills]] needed to survive in any outdoor situation. This activity may require skills in obtaining food from the wild, emergency medical treatments, [[orienteering (scoutcraft)|orienteering]], and [[Pioneering (Scout Movement)|pioneering]].

===Urban camping===
{{Expand section|date=February 2015}}
Urban camping is what it sounds like, and has its own unique set of circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.urbancamping.net/ |title=Urban Camping |publisher=Urban Camping |date= |accessdate=2013-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://weburbanist.com/2007/09/28/urban-camping-subversive-city-living-from-times-square-to-the-car-tent/ |title=Urban Camping: Subversive City Living from Times Square to Car Tents |publisher=WebUrbanist |date= |accessdate=2013-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; See [[Occupy Wall Street]] for a protest movement that involved elements of urban camping in a non-recreational form of extended outdoor accommodation.

===Winter camping===
{{main|Backpacking (wilderness)#Winter backpacking}}

Winter camping characteristically refers to wilderness camping in cold seasons in temperate climates, which typically include snow, rather than in areas where snow is present year-round (such as in arctic regions or  mountains high enough to maintain permanent snow cover).  It puts a premium on high quality and lightness of gear, experience, and nerve &amp;ndash; as risks may include [[frostbite]] and becoming snowbound.

In addition to packing shelters such as tents or [[Bivouac sack|bivouac gear]], alternative shelter-building skills are key,  such as for [[snow cave]]s and [[igloo]]s.  Wicking clothing suitable for layering and a regard for appropriate nutrition and food preparation are key.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=books.google.com|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QuIDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA58&amp;dq=Popular+Mechanics+1931+curtiss&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=Nij_TMTzG43InAeavtDBCw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CCkQ6AEwAjgK#v=onepage&amp;q=Popular%20Mechanics%201931%20curtiss&amp;f=true|title=The Thrills of Winter Camping|date=January 1933|work=Popular Mechanics}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Workcamping===
Workcamping allows campers to trade their labor variously for discounts on campsite fees, campground utilities, and even some degree of pay. Workcamping is usually [[seasonal]], from May to October, although in warm weather areas such as [[Florida]] and [[Arizona]], it can be year round.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.work-camping.com/about%20workamping%20and%20work%20camping.htm| title=What is Work Camping or &quot;Workamping&quot;?|date=|accessdate= 2010-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Workcamping is prevalent among retired travelers, who often own their own [[recreational vehicle]]s.  They will trade labor at campground tasks, such as maintenance, against fees. Camp host programs favor trades of participation in hospitality roles, such as introducing new visitors to campground facilities and organizing group activities.

==Camping equipment==
{{Howto|section|date=October 2015}}
[[File:Camping Equipment (542927498).jpg|thumb|Camping equipment]]
[[File:Dome tent.JPG|thumb|A dome tent]]
[[File:Bivvy on an island - geograph.org.uk - 139048.jpg|thumb|Shelter constructed from a tarp]]

The equipment used in camping varies with by intended activity. For instance, in survival camping the equipment consists of small items which have the purpose of helping the camper in providing [[food]], [[heat]] and [[safety]]. The equipment used in this type of camping must be lightweight and it is restricted to the mandatory items. Other types of camping such as winter camping involve having specially designed equipment in terms of tents or clothing which is strong enough to protect the camper's body from the [[wind]] and [[cold]].

Survival camping involves certain items that campers are recommended to have with them in case something goes wrong and they need to be rescued. A [[survival kit]] includes mandatory items which are small and must fit in one's pocket or which otherwise could be carried on one's person. This kit is useless in these circumstances if it is kept in the [[backpack]] that is left in camp. Such a kit should include a small metal container which can be used to heat water over a [[campfire]], a small length of [[duct tape]] which can prove useful in many situations, and an emergency [[space blanket]]. These blankets are specially designed to occupy minimal space and are perfect for making emergency shelters, keeping the camper warm. Also because of the aluminum-like color this blanket is reflective which means it can be easily seen from an [[aircraft]]. [[Candle]] stubs are good in starting a fire as well as in warming an enclosed space. One or two [[Band-Aids|band-aids]] are mandatory in this type of camping. Any camper, and not only the survival ones, need [[waterproof]] [[matches]] or a lighter and a large safety pin or [[fish hook]] which can be used in fishing. [[Rubber gloves]], antiseptic wipes, [[tinfoil]], jackknife, or [[Halazone#Chemical disinfection|halazone]] tablets (which purify the water) are also to be included into a survival kit. Although these seem too many items to be carried on one person, they are in fact small, [[lightweight]] and definitely useful.

Winter camping can be dangerous without respecting the basic rules when it comes to this particular activity.
* Firstly, the [[cold]] is protected against with clothing of three types of layers as follows: a liner layer against the camper's skin (longjohns), an insulation layer (fleece), and a water- and wind-proof outer shell.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.backpacking.net/wintertips.html| title=Winter Camping Tips|date=|accessdate= 2010-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although [[cotton]] is one of the best quality [[fabrics]] there is, it is not recommended to be worn on winter camping because if it gets wet it dries out very slowly and the wearer could freeze. Rather than cotton, winter campers should wear [[wool]] or synthetic materials. The [[boot]]s must be waterproof and the [[human head|head]] must be protected against the cold. Although it seems a good choice, campers are advised not to wear too many pairs of [[socks]] as they might restrict [[blood flow]] to the feet, resulting in cold feet. [[Gaiters]] should also be worn to avoid snow and rain wetting the boots.
* Secondly, one should include [[carbohydrates]] into their diet to keep their body warm as well as to provide energy. Hydration is very important so winter campers should drink plenty of [[water]] to keep themselves well hydrated, noting that water stores must be kept from freezing.
* Thirdly, the tent must be carefully chosen to shelter it from the wind.

===List of common equipment===
{{main|Hiking equipment}}
The following is a list of commonly used camping equipment:
* [[First aid kit]]
* [[Tent]], [[lean-to]], or other form of shelter
* [[Hammer]] or [[mallet]] to drive tent stakes into the soil (hammer are often a [[claw hammer]], which is also helpful for removing them)
* [[Sleeping bag]] and/or [[blanket]]s for warmth
* [[Sleeping pad]] or [[air mattress]] to be placed underneath the sleeping bag for cushioning from stones and twigs, as well as for [[Thermal insulation|insulation]] from the ground
* [[Lantern]] or [[flashlight]]
* [[Hatchet]], [[axe]] or [[saw]] for cutting firewood for a campfire
* Fire starter or other [[ignition device]] for starting a campfire
* [[Folding chair]]s for placement around campfire
* [[Rope]]s for stringing [[clothes line]] and for securing the shelter
* [[Tarpaulin|Tarp]] for adding additional layer of storm protection to a tent, and to shelter dining areas
* [[Raincoat]] or [[poncho]]
* [[Hiking boot]]s
* [[Fishing pole]]
* [[Chuck box]] to hold camp kitchen items for food preparation, consumption and cleanup
* [[Trash bag]]s, for the handling of waste; see [[leave no trace]]
* [[Cathole]] [[trowel]] for sanitation in areas where a [[toilet]] is not provided
* [[Insect repellent]], particularly one that has [[DEET]]
* [[Sunscreen]] for protecting the skin
* [[Personal care]] products and [[towel]]
* [[Cooler]] to store perishables and beverages. If electricity is available, a [[thermoelectricity|thermoelectric]] or [[stirling engine]] cooler can be used without the need for ice. Campers at modern campgrounds will normally bring perishable foods in coolers while backcountry campers will bring non-perishable foods such as [[dried fruit]]s, [[nut (fruit)|nuts]], [[jerky (food)|jerky]], and [[MRE]]s.
* [[Beverages]] or portable [[water filter]] for areas that have access to rivers or lakes
* Cooking implements such as a tripod chained grill, [[Dutch oven]], or La Cotta clay pot can be used for [[cooking on a campfire]]. A [[portable stove]] can be used where campfires are forbidden or impractical. If using a campground with electricity, an electric [[frying pan]] or [[slow cooker]] can be used.
* [[Firewood]] for campfires
* Emergency Preparedness Kit
* Multi-Tool or knife
* Global Positioning System (GPS)

Much of the remaining needed camping equipment is commonly available in the home, including: dishes, pots and pans; however, many people opt not to use their home items, but instead utilize equipment better tailored for camping. These amenities include heavy plastic tableware and salt and pepper shakers with tops that close in order to shelter the shakers from rain. Old kitchen gear purchased from [[thrift store]]s or [[garage sale]]s may also be used in place of home items as an alternative to buying specialized (and more expensive) camping equipment. Backpackers use lightweight and portable equipment.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.backpacker.com/august-2011-ultralight-makeover/gear/15842 ULTRALIGHT MAKEOVER], Kelly Bastone, ''Backpacker Magazine'', August 2011 {{wayback|url=http://www.backpacker.com/august-2011-ultralight-makeover/gear/15842 |date=20111002201150 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Campgrounds and commercial campsites==
[[File:Trailer Camping Marmora KOA May 2006.jpg|thumb|[[Tent trailer]] camping provides comfort in a towable package]]

Campers span a broad range of age, ability, and ruggedness, and [[campsite]]s are designed in many ways as well. Many campgrounds have sites with facilities such as fire rings, barbecue grills, utilities, shared bathrooms and laundry, as well as access to nearby recreational facilities, but not all campsites have similar levels of development. Campsites can range from a patch of dirt, to a level, paved pad with sewer and electricity. (For more information on facilities, see the campsite and [[RV park]] articles.)

Today’s campers have a range of comforts available to them, whether their shelter is a tent or a recreational vehicle. Those choosing to camp closer to their car (&quot;car camping&quot;) with a tent may have access to potable hot water, tent interior lighting and fans, and other technological changes to camping gear. For those camping in [[recreational vehicles]] (RVs), options may include air conditioning, bathrooms, kitchens, showers, and home theater systems. In the United States, Canada and Europe, some campgrounds offer hookups where recreational vehicles are supplied with electricity, water, and sewer services.

Other vehicles used for camping include motorcycles, touring bicycles, boats, canoes, [[pack animal]]s, and even [[bush planes]]; although [[Backpacking (wilderness)|backpacking]] on foot is a popular alternative.
[[File:Camping-car de type bus.JPG|thumb|A large [[recreational vehicle]] provides many amenities when camping.]]
Tent camping sites often cost less than campsites with full amenities, and most allow direct access by car. Some &quot;walk-in&quot; sites lie a short walk away from the nearest road, but do not require full backpacking equipment. Those who seek a rugged experience in the outdoors prefer to camp with only tents, or with no shelter at all (&quot;under the stars&quot;).

Although many people see in camping a chance to get out of the daily routine and improve their [[survival skills]], others would rather benefit from the many amenities that campsites are nowadays equipped with. If a few decades ago camping meant a great deal of responsibility and knowledge about wild nature, today any individual who wants to spend a weekend away in the [[Woodland|woods]] may also expect a high level of comfort.

The amenities that can be found in a campsite vary greatly, as do the prices campers must pay to use them. Usually, the most visited places tend to be more comfortable, more sought after, and more expensive. The cheapest option when it comes to camping still remains [[Backpacking (wilderness)|backpacking]] or tent camping, although it can lack some of the comforts of other options.

Many companies manufacturing camping accessories produce different types of equipment or gear that is intended to make camping a more comfortable activity. The gear used in camping is crucial and it can be a life saver. The right tent or food storage unit can easily save campers from [[insect]]s or even [[bear]] attacks. The camping community has been known for its proclivity towards leaving unused gear at the trailhead for other hikers to use or swap.

==By Country==

===United States===
From 2012 to 2013, over 40 million Americans - 14% of the United States population - went camping with a net loss of only 423,955 participants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Heisey|first1=Mary|last2=Lao|first2=Cua|title=Camping in the United States and Its Future (Infographic)|url=http://www.redrovercamping.com/camping-in-the-united-states/|website=Red Rover Camping|accessdate=17 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to an infographic produced by Red Rover Camping and based on data from the 2014 American Camper Report published by the Coleman Company, Inc. and the Outdoor Foundation, camping in the United States is gaining popularity after losing a net of 4.2 million participants from 2011 to 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2014 American Camper Report|url=http://www.outdoorfoundation.org/pdf/research.camping.2014.pdf|publisher=The Coleman Company, Inc. and the Outdoor Foundation|accessdate=17 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Kingdom===
According to data provided by the Great British Tourism Survey conducted by Visit England, almost 4.5 million camping and caravanning holidays were taken by British residents during the first half of 2015, for an average of 3.7 nights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.visitengland.com/sites/default/files/gbts_june_2015_detailed_report_final_1.pdf | title=Great Britain Tourism Survey | publisher=VisitEngland | date=June 2015 | accessdate=21 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; As with the United States, camping is gaining popularity, with an 8% increase in trips versus the same period of 2014.

A survey conducted by Campsites.co.uk in 2014 showed that campers planned to take three trips or more each year, with 78% spending 3 nights or more away.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.campsites.co.uk/guides/camping-for-beginners/camping-statistics | title=Camping Statistics | publisher=Campsites.co.uk | accessdate=21 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; July and August were, by far, the most popular months for camping, with fewer than 2% of respondents opting to camp during winter months.

[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Rok met panoramische beschildering van Indonesisch landschap TMnr 6217-7.jpg|thumb|A skirt]]
[[File:The Evolution of the Skirt (1916).webm|thumb|thumbtime=1|''The Evolution of the skirt'', Harry Julius, 1916]]
A '''skirt''' is a tube- or cone-shaped [[garment]] that hangs from the [[waist]] or [[hip]]s and covers all or part of the [[leg]]s.

The [[hemline]] of skirts can vary from [[microskirt|micro]] to floor-length and can vary according to [[Culture|cultural]] conceptions of [[modesty]] and [[aesthetics]] as well as the wearer's personal taste, which can be [[Consumer behaviour|influenced]] by such factors as [[fashion]] and social context. Most skirts are self-standing garments, but some skirt-looking panels may be part of another garment such as [[leggings]], [[shorts]], and [[skirtini|swimsuits]].

In the [[western world]], skirts are more commonly worn by women; with some exceptions such as the [[izaar]] which is worn by [[Muslim]] cultures and the [[kilt]] which is a traditional [[man|men's]] garment in [[Scotland]] and [[Ireland]]. Some fashion designers, such as [[Jean Paul Gaultier]], have shown [[men's skirts]].{{citation needed|date=November 2014}} Other cultures traditionally wear skirts.

At its simplest, a skirt can be a [[draped garment]] made out of a single piece of material (such as [[pareo]]s), but most skirts are fitted to the body at the waist or hips and fuller below, with the fullness introduced by means of [[Dart (sewing)|darts]], gores, [[pleat]]s, or panels. Modern skirts are usually made of light to mid-weight [[textile|fabrics]], such as [[denim]], jersey, worsted, or poplin. Skirts of thin or clingy fabrics are often worn with [[Slip (clothing)|slips]] to make the material of the skirt drape better and for modesty.

== History ==

A straw-woven skirt dating to 3900 BC was discovered in [[Armenia]] at the [[Areni-1 cave complex]].&lt;ref name=strawskirt&gt;{{cite web | url = http://news.am/eng/news/73915.html | title = 5,900-year-old women’s skirt discovered in Armenian cave | first =  | last =  | work = News Armenia | date = September 13, 2011 | accessdate = September 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Skirts have been worn by men and women from many cultures, such as the [[lungi]], [[lehnga]], [[Kanga (African garment)|kanga]] and [[sarong]] worn in [[South Asia]] and [[Southeast Asia]], and the [[kilt]] worn in [[Scotland]] and [[Ireland]].

The earliest known culture to have females wear clothing resembling [[miniskirt]]s were the Duan Qun [[Miao people|Miao]] (短裙苗), which literally meant &quot;short skirt Miao&quot; in [[Chinese language|Chinese]]. This was in reference to the short miniskirts &quot;that barely cover the buttocks&quot; worn by women of the tribe, and which were &quot;probably shocking&quot; to observers in [[Middle Ages|medieval]] and [[Early modern period|early modern]] times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Cultural Encounters on China's Ethnic Frontiers|first=Stevan|last=Harrell|year=1995|publisher=[[University of Washington Press]]|isbn=0-295-97528-8|pages=98 &amp; 103|postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Middle Ages, some upper-class women wore skirts over three metres in diameter at the bottom.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}  At the other extreme, the [[miniskirt]]s of the 1960s were minimal garments that may have barely covered the underwear when seated. Costume historians{{Who|date=August 2011}} typically use the word &quot;[[petticoat]]&quot; to describe skirt-like garments of the 18th century or earlier.

=== 19th century ===

During the 19th century, the cut of women's [[dress]]es in western culture varied more widely than in any other century. [[waistline (clothing)|Waistlines]] started just below the bust (the [[Empire silhouette]]) and gradually sank to the natural waist. Skirts started fairly narrow and
increased dramatically to the [[hoopskirt]] and [[crinoline]]-supported styles of the 1860s; then fullness was draped and drawn to the back by means of [[bustle]]s.
In the 1890s the [[rainy daisy]] skirt was introduced for walking or sportswear. It had a significantly shorter hemline measuring as much as six inches off the ground and would eventually influence the wider introduction of shorter hemlines in the early 20th century.&lt;ref name=hill&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hill|first1=Daniel Delis|title=As seen in Vogue : a century of American fashion in advertising|date=2007|publisher=Texas Tech University Press|location=Lubbock, Tex. |isbn=978-0-89672-616-1 |pages=23–25|edition=1. pbk. print.|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=MvilOZhaRkAC&amp;pg=PR35}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 20th and 21st centuries ===
Beginning around 1915, [[hemline]]s for daytime dresses left the floor for good. For the next fifty years  fashionable skirts became short (1920s), then long (1930s), then shorter ([[World War II|the War Years]] with their restrictions on fabric), then long (the &quot;[[Christian Dior S.A.#The &quot;New Look&quot;|New Look]]&quot;), then shortest of all from 1967 to 1970, when skirts became as short as possible while avoiding exposure of [[underwear]], which was considered [[taboo]].

Since the 1970s and the rise of [[Women wearing pants|pants/trousers for women]] as an option for all but the most formal of occasions, no one skirt length has dominated fashion for long, with short and ankle-length styles often appearing side-by-side in fashion magazines and catalogs.

== Basic types ==
&lt;!-- Expand on design considerations: hemline, fit, shape, and alphabetize --&gt;
* ''[[A-line]] skirt'', a skirt with a slight flare, roughly in the shape of a capital letter A

{{Main|Men's skirts}}
[[File:Utilkilt beige.jpg|thumb|A man wearing an [[The Utilikilts Company|Utilikilt]], 2010]]
There are a number of garments marketed to men which fall under the category of &quot;skirt&quot; or &quot;dress&quot;. These go by a variety of names and form part of the traditional dress for men from various cultures.  Usage varies – the [[dhoti]] is part of everyday dress on the Indian subcontinent while the kilt is more usually restricted to occasional wear and the foustanella is used almost exclusively as costume. Robes, which are a type of dress for men, have existed in many cultures, including the Japanese [[kimono]], the Chinese [[cheongsam]], the Arabic [[thobe]], and the African [[Senegalese kaftan]]. Robes are also used in some religious orders, such as the [[cassock]] in Christianity and various robes and cloaks that may be used in pagan rituals.  Examples of men's skirts and skirt-like garments from various cultures include:

* The [[fustanella]] is worn by men in [[Greece]] and other parts of the Balkans. By the mid-20th Century, it was relegated to ceremonial use and as period or traditional costume.
* The [[gho]] is a knee-length robe worn by men in [[Bhutan]]. They are required to wear it every day as part of national dress in government offices, in schools and on formal occasions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gho &amp; Kira: The National Dress |url=http://www.raonline.ch/pages/bt/visin2/bt_dress01.html|work=Bhutan's Culture |publisher=RAOnline|accessdate=31 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[kilt]] is a skirt of Gaelic and Celtic history, part of the [[Scotland|Scottish]] national dress in particular, and is worn formally and to a lesser extent informally.  Irish and Welsh kilts also exist but are not so much a part of national identity.
* The [[sarong]] is a piece of cloth that may be wrapped around the waist to form a skirt-like garment. Sarongs exist in various cultures under various names, including the [[pareo]] and [[lavalava]] of the Hawaiian islands and Polynesia (Samoa, Tonga, Tahiti, and Fiji), the Indian [[dhoti]] and [[lungi]], and the South Indian and Maldivian [[mundu]].

Aside from the wearing of [[kilt]]s, in the [[Western world]] skirts, dresses, and similar garments are commonly considered primarily women's clothing – which, historically, was not always the case.&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/20060417125825/http://edition.cnn.com/2003/TRAVEL/DESTINATIONS/11/04/offbeat.men.in.skirts.ap/ A closer look at men in skirts], [[CNN]], November 3, 2003.

[[File:ClothingReadyWear.jpg|thumb|Ready to wear clothing display]]
'''Ready-to-wear''' or '''''prêt-à-porter''''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|p|r|ɛ|t|_|ɑː|_|p|ɔr|ˈ|t|eɪ}}, {{IPA-fr|pʁɛ.ta pɔʁ.te}}; often abbreviated RTW; &quot;off-the-rack&quot; or &quot;off-the-peg&quot; in casual use) is the term for factory-made [[clothing]], sold in finished condition, in standardized sizes, as distinct from [[made to measure]] or [[bespoke]] clothing tailored to a particular person's frame. Off-the-peg is sometimes used for items other than clothing such as [[handbag]]s.

Ready-to-wear has rather different connotations in the spheres of [[fashion]] and classic clothing. In the [[fashion industry]], designers produce ready-to-wear clothing,  intended to be worn without significant alteration because clothing made to standard sizes fits most people. They use standard patterns, factory equipment, and faster construction techniques to keep costs low, compared to a custom-sewn version of the same item. Some [[fashion house]]s and [[fashion designers]] produce mass-produced and industrially manufactured ready-to-wear lines but others offer garments that are not unique but are produced in limited numbers.

The [[Bread and Butter tradeshow|Bread &amp; Butter]] in [[Berlin]] is considered to be the world's most important trade fair for ready-to-wear fashion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Berlin as a fashion capital: the improbable rise|url=http://www.fashionunited.co.uk/fashion-news/fashion/germanys-fashion-capital-the-improbable-rise-of-berlin-2012011713844|publisher=Fashion United UK|quote=''Bread &amp; Butter returned from Barcelona where it succeeded in establishing its status as the world’s most important fashion show in its segment.''|accessdate=24 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Men's clothing===
Due to technological advances, military uniforms were the first ready-to-wear garments to be mass-produced during the [[War of 1812]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Hollander&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hollander |first=Anne |title=The Modernization of Fashion |journal=Design Quarterly |volume=154 |year=1992 |pages=27–33 |jstor=4091263 }}&lt;/ref&gt; High-quality ready-to-wear garments for men became generally available soon thereafter, as the relatively simple, flattering cuts and muted tones of the contemporary fashion made proportionate sizing possible in mass production.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hollander&quot; /&gt;

===Women's clothing===
In the early 19th century, women's fashion was highly ornate and dependent on a precise fit, so ready-to-wear garments for women did not become widely available until the beginning of the 20th century. Before, women would alter their previously styled clothing in order to stay up to date with fashion trends. Women with larger incomes purchased new, fully tailored clothing in current styles while middle-class and lower-class women adjusted their clothing to fit changes in fashion by adding new neck collars, shortening skirts, or cinching shirt waists.&lt;ref name=&quot;Farrell-Beck&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last=Farrell-Beck |first=J. |last2=Starr Johnson |first2=J. |year=1992 |title=Remodeling and Renovating Clothes, 1870-1933 |journal=Dress |volume=19 |pages=37–46 |doi=10.1179/036121192805298409 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The widespread adoption of ready-to wear clothing reflected a variety of factors including economic disparities, a desire for an independent fashion industry, and an increase in media attention. America faced multiple depressions and fiscal turmoil in the early 20th century and the demand for affordable and fashionable women's clothing sparked designers and department stores to manufacture clothing in bulk quantities that were accessible to women of all classes and incomes. Through the emergence of the US ready-to-wear market, designers like [[Chanel]] with their shift dress or the mail-order catalogs sent to rural farms by [[Sears]] allowed women to purchase clothing faster and at a cheaper price.&lt;ref name=&quot;Marketti&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last=Marketti |first=S. |last2=Parsons |first2=J. L. |year=2007 |title=American Fashions for American Women: Early Twentieth Century Efforts to Develop an American Fashion Identity |journal=Dress |volume=34 |issue=1 |pages=79–95 |doi=10.1179/036121107805252881 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another significant factor created by the ready-to-wear industry was the US development of a style independent from Europe. The US fashion market turned way from Parisian style in favor of an individualized apparel industry promoted through advertisements and articles in magazines like ''[[Women's Wear Daily]]'', ''[[Harper’s Bazaar]]'', and ''[[Ladies Home Journal]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Marketti&quot; /&gt;

Ready-to-wear also sparked new interests in health, beauty, and diet as manufactured clothing set specific, standardized sizes in attire in order to increase quantities for profit.&lt;ref&gt;Brumberg, J. (2011). “Fasting Girls: The Emerging Ideal of Slenderness in American Culture.” In Women’s America: Refocusing the Past. (2) 7. New York: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Women of larger sizes had difficulties finding apparel in department stores, as most manufacturers maintained and sold the limited sizes across the nation.

Overall ready-to-wear fashion exposed women to the newest styles and fashion trends, leading to a substantial increase in profits by US factories from $12,900,583 in 1876 to $1,604,500,957 in 1929.&lt;ref name=&quot;Farrell-Beck&quot; /&gt; The ready-to-wear fashion revolution led to an expansion of the US fashion industry that made fashionable apparel accessible, cost effective, and commensurable.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}

==Haute couture and bespoke==
{{further|Bespoke tailoring}}
Fashion houses that produce a women's ''[[haute couture]]'' line, such as [[Chanel]], [[Christian Dior SA|Dior]], [[Christian Lacroix|Lacroix]] and  [[Yves Saint Laurent (brand)|Saint Laurent]] also produce a ready-to-wear line, which returns a greater [[Profit (accounting)|profit]] because of the higher volume of garments made and the greater availability of the clothing. The construction of ready-to-wear clothing is also held to a different standard than that of ''haute couture'' due to its industrial nature. High-end ready-to-wear lines are sometimes based upon a famous gown or other pattern that is then duplicated and advertised to raise the visibility of the designer.

==Collections==
In high-end fashion, ready-to-wear collections are usually presented by fashion houses each season during a period known as [[Fashion Week]]. This takes place on a city-by-city basis, and the most prominent of these include [[London Fashion Week|London]], [[New York Fashion Week|New York]], [[Milan Fashion Week|Milan]], and [[Paris Fashion Week|Paris]], and are held twice a year—the Fall/Winter (FW) shows take place in February, and the Spring/Summer (SS) collections are shown in September. Smaller lines including the Cruise and Pre-Fall collections, which add to the [[retail]] value of a [[brand]], are presented separately at the [[fashion designer]]'s discretion.  Ready-to-wear fashion weeks occur separately and earlier than those of ''haute couture''.

[[File:Classical spectacular10.jpg|thumb|A [[classical music]] concert in the [[Rod Laver Arena]], [[Melbourne]], [[Australia]], 2005]]
[[File:Bernardo Strozzi Kontsert.jpg|thumb|''Concert'', by Italian [[baroque]] artist [[Bernardo Strozzi]]]]
A '''concert''' is a live [[music]] [[performance]] in front of an [[audience]].

The performance may be by a single [[musician]], sometimes then called a ''[[recital]]'', or by a [[musical ensemble]], such as an [[orchestra]], [[choir]], or [[musical band|band]]. Concerts are held in a wide variety and size of settings, from private [[house]]s and small [[nightclub]]s, dedicated [[concert hall]]s, [[entertainment centre]]s and [[parks]] to large multipurpose buildings, and even sports [[stadium]]s. Indoor concerts held in the largest [[Music venue|venues]] are sometimes called ''arena concerts'' or ''[[amphitheatre]] concerts''. Informal names for a concert include ''show'' and ''[[Gig (musical performance)|gig]]''.

Regardless of venue, musicians usually perform on a [[Stage (theatre)|stage]]. Concerts often require [[live event support]] with [[professional audio]] equipment. Before recorded music, concerts provided the main opportunity to hear musicians play. 
[[File:Concert of Joler Gan Band, Bangabndhu International Conference Centre (BICC).jpg|thumb|Concert of Joler Gan Band, Bangabndhu International Conference Centre (BICC)]]

==Types==
The nature of a concert varies by [[musical genre]], individual performers, and the venue.  Concerts by a small [[jazz]] combo or small [[Bluegrass music|bluegrass]] band may have the same order of program, mood, and volume—but vary in music and dress. In a similar way, a particular musician, band, or genre of music might attract concert attendees with similar dress, hairstyle, and behavior. For example, concert goers in the 1960s often had long hair (sometimes in dread lock form), sandals and inexpensive clothing made of natural fibers. Regular attendees to a concert venue might also have a recognizable style that comprises that venue's ''scene''.

===Theatrical===
Some performers or groups put on very elaborate and expensive shows. To create a memorable and exciting atmosphere and increase the spectacle, performers frequently include additional entertainment devices. These can include elaborate [[stage lighting]], [[Live event support#Visual support|electronic imagery]] via (IMAG) system and/or pre-recorded video, inflatable sets, artwork or other set pieces, various [[special effect]]s such as [[theatrical smoke and fog]] and [[pyrotechnics]], and unusual [[costumes]] or wardrobe. Some [[singer]]s, especially popular music, augment concert sound with pre-recorded [[accompaniment]], back-up dancers, and even broadcast vocal tracks of the singer's own voice. Activities during these concerts can include [[dancing]], sing-alongs, and [[moshing]]. Performers known for including these elements in their performances include: [[Pink Floyd]], [[The Flaming Lips]], [[Cher]], [[Alice Cooper]], [[Iron Maiden (band)|Iron Maiden]], [[Daft Punk]], [[Lady Gaga]], [[Jean Michel Jarre]], [[Sarah Brightman]], [[Kiss (band)|KISS]], [[Gwar]], [[Slipknot (band)]], and [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]].

===Festivals===
{{Main|Music festival|List of music festivals}}
Concerts involving a greater number of artists, especially those that last for multiple days, are known as [[festivals]]. Unlike other concerts, which typically remain in a single genre of music or work of a particular artist, festivals often cover a broad scope of music and arts. Due to their size, festivals are almost exclusively held outdoors. New platforms for festivals are becoming increasingly popular such as [[Jam Cruise]], which is a festival held on a cruise ship, as well as Mayan Holidaze, which is a destination festival held in [[Tulum]]. A few examples of the hundreds of festivals around the world include: 
* [[Big Day Out]], Australia
* [[Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival]], United States
* [[Download Festival]], United Kingdom
* [[V Festival]], United Kingdom
* [[Falls Festival]], Australia
* [[Frutillar Musical Weeks]], [[Chile]]

===Concert tour===

A concert tour is a series of concerts by an artist or group of artists in different cities or locations.  Often concert tours are named, to differentiate different tours by the same artist and associate a specific tour with a particular album or product (for example: [[Iron Maiden]] [[World Slavery Tour]]).  Especially in the popular music world, such tours can become large-scale enterprises that last for several months or even years, are seen by hundreds of thousands or millions of people, and bring in millions of dollars (or the equivalent) in ticket revenues.

Different segments of longer concert tours are known as &quot;legs&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What is a Concert Tour?|url=http://tourbeat.com/news-and-announcements/what-is-a-concert-tour|publisher=[[TourBeat]]|accessdate=10 January 2015|quote=A concert tour is an opportunity for musicians to perform over longer periods of time across several cities, which are differentiated by segments known as &quot;legs.&quot; Legs of tours of can be denoted by a series of dates that have no long break between them, by geographical regions or destinations, or by different opening acts. Each city or region may have the same opening act for each leg, or they may change opening acts at each city.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The different legs of a tour are denoted in different ways, dependent on the artist and type of tour, but the most common means of separating legs are dates (especially if there is a long break at some point), countries and/or continents, or different opening acts.  In the largest concert tours it is becoming more common for different legs to employ separate touring production crews and equipment, local to each geographical region.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}  Concert tours are often administered on the local level by concert promoters or by [[performing arts presenters]]. Usually, small concert tours are managed by a [[road manager]] whereas large concert tours are managed by a [[tour manager]].

==Revenue==
[[File:U2 360 Zooropa Oakland.jpg|alt=|thumb|
The [[U2 360° Tour]]]]
While admission to some concerts is free, it is common practice to charge money for concerts by selling admission tickets. Historically, concerts were the primary source of revenue for musicians.  Revenue from ticket sales typically goes to the performing artists, producers, venue, organizers and the brokers. In the case of [[benefit concert]]s, a portion of profits often go towards a [[charitable organization]].

Additional revenue is also often raised through in-concert advertising, from free local concerts for local sponsorships to sponsorships from corporations during major tours [[List of Latin phrases: E#exempli gratia|e.g.]] 2009's &quot;''Vans' Warped Tour Presented by AT&amp;amp;T''&quot;. Both [[Vans]] and [[AT&amp;amp;T Inc.|AT&amp;amp;T]] would have paid significant amounts to have their company names included at the forefront in all marketing material for the [[Warped Tour]].

Concessions and merchandise are also often sold during and after concerts; often by the venue in the case of the former, and by the performing band or artist in the case of the latter.

{{As of|2011}}, the highest-grossing concert tour of all time is [[U2 360 Tour]], with gross revenues of $736,137,344.&lt;ref name=&quot;wrap&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/468753/u2-set-to-wrap-biggest-concert-tour-ever|title=U2 Set to Wrap Biggest Concert Tour Ever|first=Ray|last=Waddell|work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard.com]]|accessdate=31 July 2011|date=29 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second highest-grossing concert tour of all time is [[The Rolling Stones]]' [[A Bigger Bang Tour]], which earned approximately $558 million between 2005 and 2007.&lt;ref name=&quot;biggerbang&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/1048656/rolling-stones-tour-grosses-more-than-half-a-billion|title=Rolling Stones Tour Grosses More Than Half A Billion |work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|accessdate=2009-11-17|date=April 9, 2007|last=Pietrolungo|first=Silvio}}&lt;/ref&gt; Madonna's [[Sticky &amp;amp; Sweet Tour]], which earned $408 million in 2008 and 2009 was the highest-earning tour by a female artist.&lt;ref name=&quot;stickysweet&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/photos/live/267516/madonna-closes-tour-in-tel-aviv-2nd-highest-grossing-trek-of-all-time|title=Madonna Closes Tour In Tel Aviv;Second Highest Grossing Trek Of All Time|date=September 2, 2009|work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|accessdate=2014-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is unlikely that new acts will top these numbers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Johan|first1=Jillian|title=The Show Must Go On|url=http://www.aei.org/publication/the-show-must-go-on/|publisher=aei|accessdate=10 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[United States]], and increasingly in the [[United Kingdom]] and [[Canada]], '''prom''' is a formal ([[black tie]]) [[Dance party|dance]] or gathering of [[high school]] students. This event is typically held near the end of the senior year (the last year of high school). Proms figure greatly in popular culture and is a major event among high school students. High school juniors attending the prom may call it &quot;junior prom&quot; while high-school seniors may call it &quot;senior prom&quot; or &quot;senior ball&quot;. In practice, this event may be a combined junior/senior dance.

At a prom, a Prom King and Prom Queen may be revealed. These are honorary titles awarded to students elected in a school-wide vote prior to the prom, and seniors are usually awarded these titles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Carlos |first=Amanda |url=http://www.fontanaheraldnews.com/articles/2010/05/04/opinion/doc4bd9b2e0a9f91749406756.txt |title=Carlos Commentary: Summit students enjoy a successful prom |publisher=Fontana Herald News |date=2010-04-29 |accessdate=2010-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Juniors may also be honored, but would be called &quot;Prom Prince&quot; or &quot;Prom Princess.&quot; Other students may be honored with inclusion in a &quot;Prom Court.&quot; The selection method for a Prom Court is similar to that of [[Homecoming]] Queen/Princess, King, and Court. Inclusion in a Prom Court may be a reflection of popularity of those students elected and their level of participation in school activities, such as clubs or sports.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hhs.pasco.k12.fl.us/?p=4466|title=Hudson High Prom Court Nominations|accessdate=2012-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eyeofthetigernews.com/2012/03/09/roseville-high-school-junior-prom-nominations-should-be-based-on-more-than-popularity|title=Nominations Should be Based Upon More than Popularity|accessdate=2013-02-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Prom Queen and Prom King may be given crowns to wear. Members of the Prom Court may be given sashes to wear and photographed together.&lt;ref&gt;http://glendalehigh.com/images09/prom-court-IMG_7356.jpg |accessdate=2013-05-15&lt;/ref&gt;

Similar events take place in many other parts of the world.  In [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]], the terms [[school formal]], and [[ball (dance)|ball]] are most commonly used for occasions equivalent to the American prom, and the event is usually held for students in senior years, although the bestowing of the regal titles rarely, if ever, occurs. For juniors there is typically a dance event by the name of a Social. It is a social event that parents usually attend. Ages that Socials are held for are from 10-14. Many schools hold a formal graduation ball for finishing students at the end of the year in place of or as well as a formal.  In [[Ireland]] a ''debutante ball'' or [[Debs and grads|Debs]] may also be held. In Poland high schools organize a &quot;[[studniówka]]&quot;. The term &quot;prom&quot; is becoming more common in the UK and Canada due to the influence of US TV shows and movies but &quot;Leavers Ball&quot; or &quot;Leavers Do&quot; were more common terms.

==In the United States==

=== History ===
{{Unreferenced section|date=February 2014}}
[[Image:Prom crowded dancefloor.jpg|thumb|Prom dance]]
In the early days of high school proms, the nighttime dance served a similar function to a debutante ball. Early proms were times of firsts: the first adult social event for teenagers; the first time taking the family car out after dark; the first real dress-up affair; and so forth. Proms also served as a heavily-documented occasion, similar to a milestone event such as first communion or a wedding, in which the participants were taking an important step into a new stage in their lives. In earlier days, the prom may have also served as an announcement of engagement for the “best couple” after the prom court had been crowned and recognized.

While high school yearbooks did not start covering proms and including prom pictures until the 1930s and 1940s, historians, including Meghan Bretz, believe proms may have existed at colleges as early as the late 1800s. The journal of a male student at Amherst College in 1894 recounts an invitation and trip to an early prom at neighboring Smith College for women. The word prom at that time may just have been a fancy description for an ordinary junior or senior class dance, but prom soon took on larger-than-life meaning for high school students.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}}

Proms worked their way down incrementally from college gatherings to high school extravaganzas. In the early 1900s, prom was a simple tea dance where high school seniors wore their Sunday best. In the 1920s and 1930s, prom expanded into an annual class banquet where students wore party clothes and danced afterward. As Americans gained more money and leisure time in the 1950s, proms became more extravagant and elaborate, bearing similarity to today’s proms. The high school gym may have been an acceptable setting for sophomore dances (soph hop), but junior prom and senior balls gradually moved to hotel ballrooms and country clubs. Competition blossomed, as teens strove to have the best dress, the best mode of transportation, and the best looking date. Competition for the prom court also intensified, as the designation of “prom queen” became an important distinction of popularity. In a way, prom became the pinnacle event of a high school student’s life, the ultimate dress rehearsal for a wedding.

Today, prom continues to be a notable event in the social climate of high schools. Popular movies and novels attest to the importance of prom themes, prom dates, and prom queens. In some areas, the traditions of prom are not as rigid as they used to be, with some areas allowing individuals or groups to attend instead of couples. In 1975 U.S. First Daughter [[Susan Ford]] held her prom in the [[East Room]] of the White House.

=== Terminology ===
Usage of the term “prom” is becoming more common and appears to be a colloquial and regional practice. Formal English usage suggests &quot;Prom&quot; is a noun and should be preceded by an article although it often is not in practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=&quot;Prom&quot; vs. &quot;The Prom&quot;|url=http://www.talkbass.com/forum/f34/prom-vs-prom-342610/ |date=2007-06-22 |accessdate=2012-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&quot;Prom&quot; is a shortened version of either '''promenade'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2013-05-08/opinion/ct-perspec-0508-prom-20130508_1_school-prom-purchasing-dresses-american-girl|title=Prom An Iconic American Tradition|date=2013-05-03|accessdate=2013-05-20|work=Chicago Tribune|first=Jonathan|last=Zimmerman}}&lt;/ref&gt; or &quot;promotional dance,&quot; in which students celebrated being promoted from one grade or school to the next.

=== Attire ===
[[File:Girl.in.Prom.Dress.1950s.jpg|thumb|150px|Girl in [[Formal wear|formal prom attire]], [[United States of America|USA]], 1950s ]]
Boys usually dress in black or white formal wear, regardless of the time of the event, sometimes paired with brightly colored ties or [[bow tie]]s with [[vest]]s, in some cases in colors matching their date’s dress. Most are rented from stores that specialize in formal wear rentals.

Girls wear traditional ladies' dresses or evening gowns and adorn themselves with ladies’ costume jewellery such as earrings and a necklace. Traditionally girls wear perfume, and make-up such as eyeshadow, lipstick and blush. Girls also wear a [[corsage]], given to them by their dates, and girls give boys matching [[boutonnière]]s to be worn on their lapels.

Prom attendees may be limited by their schools to be juniors or seniors and guests under age 21.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=District 155 Guidelines|url=http://www.d155.org/pr/info/prom.htm |date=2010-05-21 |accessdate=2010-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Roxana Hegeman |url=http://news.yahoo.com/kansas-school-apologies-airman-prom-dispute-204148799.html |title=Kansas school apologizes to Airman in prom dispute |publisher=News.yahoo.com |date=2013-05-01 |accessdate=2013-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before prom, girls typically get their hair styled, often in groups as a social activity at a salon. Prom couples then gather at a park, garden, or their own and their dates’ houses for single and/or group photographs. Prom attendees may rent [[limousine]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/local/ct-met-illinois-legislature-0515-20130515,0,7636634.story|title=DUI Prom Bus Driver Charged|date=2013-05-14|accessdate=2013-05-20|work=Chicago Tribune}}&lt;/ref&gt; to transport groups of friends from their homes to the prom venue: a banquet hall or school gymnasium. Some schools host their proms at hotel ballrooms or other venues where weddings typically take place. The dance itself may have a band or DJ.  At prom, a meal may be served.  The cost of prom in the United States averaged $1078 per family&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.yahoo.com/soaring-cost-prom-numbers-101500857.html |title=The soaring cost of prom: By the numbers – Yahoo!

Some high schools allow only the graduating class (Seniors) to have a prom. Some schools also allow grade 11 (Juniors) to have a prom, and select high schools even have proms for Freshmen and Sophomores. In some cases there is a combined Junior/Senior prom.  Some American high schools and colleges that do not allow school-sponsored dances will host a Junior/Senior prom as a banquet instead of a dance. Typically, students still dress in formal attire and attend as couples. More and more colleges are hosting proms in recent years, usually as [[fundraisers]] for campus organizations such as Ballroom Dance groups, fraternities/sororities, or other organizations.  In recent years, American teens have started asking celebrities or famous models to their Proms.&lt;ref&gt;

=== Post Prom ===
After the prom, parents or a community may host a “prom after-party”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/features/sns-rt-us-usa-prombre94g0ma-20130517,0,6197270,full.story|title=Prom After Party|date=2013-05-18|accessdate=2013-05-20|work=Chicago Tribune}}&lt;/ref&gt; or “afterglow” or “post-prom”&lt;ref&gt;http://jhhs.d214.org/assets/5/Documents/end%20of%20year%20calendar.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dehspostprom.com/senior_tips_for_attending_post_prom/ |title=Senior Tips for Attending Post Prom |publisher=DEHS Post Prom |date= |accessdate=2013-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; at a restaurant, entertainment venue, or a student’s home. Other traditions often include trips to nearby attractions, such as [[amusement park]]s, regional or local parks, or family or rented vacation houses. Some of these post-prom events are chaperoned&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.montgomeryschoolsmd.org/schools/whitmanhs/ptsa/postprom.aspx|title=Walt Whitman High School Post Prom Page | accessdate=2012-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; and some are unsupervised.
Many Post Proms (After Prom Events) are at the school, and involve bringing entertainment such as interactive games, artists, and other entertainers to the school.

==In the United Kingdom==
[[File:Tiverton , Tiverton Hotel - geograph.org.uk - 1375766.jpg|thumb|200px|Students and their parents in the prom night, England]]
In the United Kingdom prior to the 2000s, many [[secondary schools]] held a &quot;Summer [[Ball (dance)|Ball]]&quot; to celebrate the end of term, and/or &quot;Leavers Ball&quot; to celebrate the end of schooling, but usually this did not have the cultural or social significance of the US-style Prom.  From the 1970s there had also been a tradition of &quot;School Discos&quot;, which were semi-formal events held at various times of the year, in particular during the Christmas period, though not all secondary schools would allow such events or &quot;do's&quot;.

During the 2000s, school &quot;Proms&quot; have become common at UK schools, apparently due to the influence of US TV shows.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/education/education-news/the-high-school-prom-arrives-in-uk-via-stretch-limo-naturally-552740.html | location=London | work=The Independent | first1=Nicholas | last1=Pyke | first2=Steve | last2=Bloomfield | title=The high school prom arrives in UK (via stretch limo, naturally) | date=2004-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The ''[[Daily Telegraph]]'' reported in 2012 that:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/9459579/Fairytale-ending-the-rise-of-the-British-prom.html | location=London | work=The Telegraph | first1=Sally | last1=Williams |title=Fairytale ending: the rise of the British prom | date=2012-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;elaborate 'passing out' celebrations for Year 11 students (aged 15–16) and Year 13 (aged 17–18) have become a cultural phenomenon, stoking passions and rivalries, and refashioning the sense of what a school party should be. More than 85 per cent of schools in Britain hold school Proms, which range from no-frills dinners in school halls to tailor-made extravaganzas in five-star hotels with such extras as ice- cream vans and photo booths.&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Schools in England, Wales and Northern Ireland predominantly hold their Prom, or &quot;School Formal&quot;, at the end of secondary education in Year 11 (ages 15/16) ''and'' the end of Sixth Form (aged 18), for those who have continued school.

In Scotland it is usually only held at the end of S6 (ages 17/18) because all high schools in Scotland have pupils up to age 18 years, whereas elsewhere in the UK many students have to go to college to study for A-Levels. Proms are usually held in June, after the end of year exams. At Scottish formal events, boys usually wear kilts (kilts are also often seen in the other [[Celtic nations|Celtic]] regions) and Highland dress outfitters often sell out in an area around this time of year due to demand from school events. Also in Scotland it is customary for traditional Scottish country dancing (part of the curriculum of all secondary schools) to be included.

=== Africa ===

In [[Egypt]], private schools have proms similar to ones held in the USA but with slight differences. The prom is held for a maximum of 3 hours, where teachers attend and enjoy some time with their students. Then there is the &quot;after-prom&quot;, where no teachers or parents are allowed, during that time, the real party begins with all the students dancing and enjoying their time. The after prom can continue to 4 am and 5 am.

In [[South Africa]], the equivalent of the American prom is the [[Matric]] Dance, taking place during the matriculation (i.e., final) year of high school (12th grade). It takes place towards the end of the third quarter, shortly before the spring break, after which the matriculation examinations commence. It usually takes the form of a formal dinner and dance. In most schools, the 11th grade class is responsible for arranging the event. Sometimes teachers and parents also attend.

In [[Kenya]], [[Ethiopia]], [[Nigeria]], [[Uganda]] and [[Ghana]], [Tanzania] most private schools with [[expatriates]] have proms or “end of year socials.”

=== Asia ===

In [[Afghanistan]] there is a lunch party organized by the graduating students and called &quot;graduation party.&quot; This is mostly seen in the university level graduation after the 16th class with a bachelor's degree, this day all the University seniors, faculty members and professors are invited as honors. The party has two major parts; the formal part with the professors and guests and the informal part with the music and dancing at the 2nd phase. Both boys and girls wear &quot;made/rented&quot; academic dress through the entire part one of the party and in part two it is a party and casual. The students who are graduating may choose the halls based on the availability and pricing, usually the halls are not available because all the Afghan parties like wedding are held in rented halls. Students calculate total participants including guests and family members then coordinate with the hall personal for the pricing including the food and the music and all, then the gross total is shared on the number of students. Usually this is 1000AFs/student equal to $20.

In [[Hong Kong]], prom culture is inherited from the western countries and is generally called ball, such as Christmas Ball. This usually takes place during Christmas and Summer Break. This is more popular in the secondary education stage rather than in universities.  Schools, apart from international schools, holding proms are usually single-sex school where normally the Student Unions in the schools will cooperate each other in organizing the event. In recent years, more and more individual unions got united and formed different student unions associations so as to organize large-scale events including large joint-school proms. Except those proms within the academic field, there are also adult proms for charity yearly where celebrities and government officers always go to these functions.

In [[India]] and [[Nepal]], the equivalent to some extent is a farewell party or farewell gathering. The outgoing students are given a warm send-off by the junior students and staff. All the seniors are felicitated with souvenirs and superlatives are given awards.Unlike countries like [[USA]] and [[Canada]] there wouldn't be couple dances in India.

In [[Israel]], high school graduation parties usually combine a play and a humble ceremony, followed by a dance party. In the past years, influenced by American culture, more and more graduates decide to hold a private graduation party similar to the American prom, with dress code, prom dates, limousines, and prom kings or queens, although usually not supported by the school.

In [[Lebanon]], proms are held after the graduation ceremony at night. They are usually held at hotels with a formal dress code, prom dates, rented cars and, occasionally, prom kings and queens.

In [[Singapore]], proms are held at the near end of a senior year for secondary schools. Proms are normally held after the final examinations of all senior students before graduating.

In [[Malaysia]], proms are gaining in popularity, especially in the bigger cities. However, these gatherings are usually organized by students, and the school administration is not involved.

In [[Pakistan]], the equivalent to the American prom is a farewell dinner or farewell function that takes place at the end of the college academic year. In a farewell function, one girl is appointed “Lady of the Evening”, and one boy is appointed “Gentleman of the Evening”.

In the [[Philippines]], proms are popular in high schools. Prom usually takes place in the junior and senior years of high school, which is normally around February or March. Proms are commonly known as “JS Prom”, or, junior–senior prom. Conversely, if a high school has separate dances for juniors and seniors, the term &quot;prom&quot; is reserved for the juniors, and the dance for the seniors is called a &quot;graduation ball&quot; (often abbreviated as &quot;grad ball&quot; or simply &quot;ball&quot;.) The associated student body generally organizes the event. Usually a prom king and queen are chosen. The basis for the king and queen judgment is the beauty and the fashion of the nominee, not the popularity.

In [[Vietnam]], the equivalent to the prom is called ''[[liên hoan cuối năm]]''. Some schools hold their liên hoan cuối năm at restaurants. But, majority of schools prefer simple &quot;tea parties&quot; with snacks and soft drinks inside their classrooms. In the high schools at rural countrysides, they don't celebrate at all. Unlike other countries, the students don't dress up in fancy dresses or tuxedos. Sometimes, they just simply wear school uniform to the tea parties.

=== Europe ===
{{Unreferenced section|date=August 2013}}

====Albania====
In Albania, &quot;mbrëmja e maturës&quot;, as graduation night, is the event held at the end of the senior year. Every school organizes it independently and the event usually takes place in May. Ceremonially it is very similar to prom nights in the United States. 

====Czech Republic====
In the [[Czech Republic]], the last year in ''[[Gymnasium (school)|Gymnasium]]'' is celebrated with ''maturitní ples'' (“graduation ball”). This ball takes place before exams are taken, usually in January or February, the traditional season for balls during the ''[[Carnival in Germany, Switzerland and Austria|Fasching]]'' (e.g., [[List of balls in Vienna]]). Normally, balls are formal but modern elements are included, too. The students invite their parents, other relatives and friends to come to the ball with them. The balls usually have a theme and the classes perform choreographed dance routines at the beginning or during the evening. The students also receive a ribbon. It's common that various artists are invited to perform at the ball, ranging from fireshow performers to famous celebrities. At the midnight, the classes perform &quot;midnight surprise performance&quot; – typically some sort of funny act. Sometimes several schools organize a joint event. The income is often used to finance a collective voyage of the students after the exams.

====Bulgaria====
In [[Bulgaria]], the ball is called ''abiturientski bal'' and is held at the end of 12th grade, when you are aged 18/19. Preparations for the ball begin at the end of the 11th grade, because students are supposed to organise the whole event. It is celebrated in May, mainly on the 23rd, 24th or 25th, after finishing exams. Students can bring a date to the event which is usually held in a restaurant or a club. Usually, before the main event there is a big gathering in front of the high school’s building, where graduates count to 12 (as in 12 grades) and take photos with each other before going to the restaurant called ''izprashtane'' (“dispatchment”). At the main event in the restaurant/hotel, there is music, usually pop and retro. Students are free to dance with whomever they want, even if they have come with a date. There is usually an afterparty at a dance club. Some people even organize a second afterparty. After the prom night, students usually go to an excursion together for 3 to 5 days. The popular destinations are the [[Black sea]] coast and [[Turkey]].

====Benelux====
In [[Belgium]], as well as in some parts of the [[Netherlands]], senior students celebrate their last 100 days of high school with a special day called ''Chrysostomos'' or ''100-dagen feest'' (“100-days party”). Tradition states that on this winter day, seniors are allowed to pull pranks on their teachers and fellow students. Some schools handle a theme as dresscode, while others go for the traditional outfit: blue jeans, a black cotton jacket, a black hat (with a red or blue ribbon) and a whistle around the neck. Some even paint their faces and some seniors also carry a spray can (shaving cream or other fluids) to “attack” the non-seniors with. A noisy march through town is also part of the gig. Later during the day, students perform an act at school, usually a silly show involving school or a parody. In the evening, students head to a rented club to party. This involves dancing, singing and lots of beer to get a taste of fraternity life. Sometimes even teachers join the party to show that they too have a wild side. In the Netherlands, households where a child who has passed their high school exams often hang the student's backpack on a flagpole which is attached to the front of the house.

====Former Yougoslavia====
In [[Bosnia]], [[Croatia]], [[Serbia]] and the [[Republic of Macedonia]], ''matursko veče'' (''maturalna večer'' and ''maturska večer''), as graduation night, is the event held at the end of the senior year. It is similar to prom night in the [[United States]]. In Croatia, it is sometimes held in January or February, as in Austria.

====Denmark====
In [[Denmark]], the prom is called ''galla'' and takes place before the exams begin. The word ''galla'' refers to the dress code which is long dresses for the women and suits for the men. The prom in Denmark is well known for keeping the traditional dance Les Lanciers, where the third graders of high school (the seniors) start the whole dance, then the 1st and 2nd graders join later on (the high school, called &quot;gymnasium&quot; in Denmark, is three years).

====Estonia====
In [[Estonia]], the equivalent of the prom is often called ''[[Saja päeva ball]]''. The event takes place 100 days prior to the graduation and may be organized with several school altogether. Students can dance but other events may be involved, too, besides ball room dancing. The clothes are much the same kind as in proms of other countries.

====Finland====
In [[Finland]], the equivalent of the prom is called ''[[vanhojen tanssit]]'' (ball for the old). The event is in February when high school students in their third year stop going to school in order to prepare for their ''[[abitur]]'' exams, and second grade students become the oldest in the school. Students learn 10–15 dances for the event. Earlier the habit was to wear old clothes and look old. Nowadays clothes are very much the same kind as in U.S. proms.

====France====
[[File:Couple of students in Paris.jpg|thumb|Couple of students in Paris]]

In [[France]], high school students have only recently experienced prom. On June 27, 2013, more than 300 students in Paris, France held a prom.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.leparisien.fr/espace-premium/paris-75/un-bal-de-promo-solidaire-27-06-2013-2931837.php&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.raje.fr/archives2/3202-decouverte-the-bal-de-promo-solidaire&lt;/ref&gt; Event planning company [http://www.White-Tie-Affair.com White-Tie-Affair] partnered up with multiple local companies to host the [[:fr:Bal de promo|“Solidarity Prom Ball”]] charity gala. Food, drinks, venue, limousine&lt;ref&gt;http://www.donnons-leur-une-chance.org/bal-de-promo-solidaire.html&lt;/ref&gt; as well as gift bags were sponsored by the different companies and provided for the students for free. On top of that, famous French music groups {{YouTube|xFQhAe0hmnY|Psy4 de la Rime}} and Alibi Montana were the guest performance of the evening. All proceeds from the students’ entrance fee were donated to [http://www.donnons-leur-une-chance.org/ Donnons Leur Une Chance], a French non-profit organization&lt;ref&gt;http://www.donnons-leur-une-chance.org/qui-sommes-nous.html&lt;/ref&gt; that will help realize educational projects.

====Germany====
In [[Germany]] (and [[Austria]]), students celebrate their graduation from [[high school]], or [[Gymnasium (school)|Gymnasium]], with an '''Abifeier''' (from the graduation certificate or [[Abitur]]) or '''Maturaball''' (in Austria the graduation exam is called [[Matura#Matura_in_Austria|Matura]]). In Germany the events are informal and usually contain a series of student-organized activities that tend to make fun of teachers, sometimes with an extended [[hagiography]] about the favorite teacher. In Austria the Maturaball is formal and can be seen as a synergy of proms and cotillions and often are highlights of the regional ball season (between November and the end of Carneval) referencing the glamour of the great ball tradition of the former [[Austrian-Hungarian monarchy]]. More like the prom is the german '''Abiball''', that follows the official graduation ceremony. Here the students usually wear suits and ball gowns. The Abiball often follows a certain order with a welcome, introductions, an award ceremony for students and sometimes an extended demonstration of all of the artistic outpourings of the students and staff. This is followed by a band (sometimes the school's own band, if there is any) or a DJ playing music, usually starting with a [[waltz]] before moving on to other dancing. Alcohol is available at these events since the legal drinking age in Germany is 16 (for beer and wine), and most graduating students are 18 or older.

====Hungary====
In [[Hungary]], students receive a ribbon to mark the beginning of the preparation for their graduation. Students receive this ribbon at a ball called &quot;szalagavató&quot;, meaning the &quot;inauguration of ribbons&quot;. This prom-like evening dance is traditionally held in the ball season of January–February, but recently sometimes also before Christmas. At the beginning of the ball, each graduating class performs a choreographed dance they learned during the months leading up to the event. After the school organised ball of the evening, students usually go out at night to drink to bars and discos, even if some of them are below drinking age (18 in Hungary).

====Ireland====
In [[Ireland]], this formal dance is called the [[débutante]]s' ball. This is referred to as the &quot;grad&quot;, or, informally, '''debs''' in eastern Ireland. This is a formal dance for students who have just graduated from secondary school (high school) and is traditionally held between September and October, after the students have finished exams. In rural areas it often takes place in July or August. The same formal dance is also occasionally known as the &quot;grad&quot; among students in all-male schools. &quot;Grads&quot; can also refer to an informal dance mid-way through the school year. Some all-boys schools have their debs in January, February, or March of their final year. This is a tradition followed by all-boys schools in Limerick. Students who did an optional &quot;transition&quot; year from junior to senior cycle often get to attend the debs going into their final year and leaving their final year. Alcohol is available at these events.

====Italy====
In [[Italy]] the equivalent is known as &quot;i cento giorni&quot; (''the one hundred days''), an unofficial party organised by students themselves in a location of their choice 100 days before the final exams before high school graduation. Usually the party is not held with all graduating students, rather every class organizes a separated party to celebrate with classmates.
The tradition of &quot;i cento giorni&quot; comes from Piedmontese military schools in the late 1800, where days remaining to graduation were counted starting from the 100th with the locution &quot;Mak Π 100&quot;, from [[Piedmontese language]] &quot;mac pì 100&quot;, translating as &quot;just more 100 (days remaining).&quot;

====Lithuania====
In [[Lithuania]], the prom is held after final exams, usually the same day when high school diplomas are presented. The event is called ''išleistuvės''.

====Norway====
In [[Norway]], this event varies from school to school. It is usually held during the winter months, and is often called &quot;Nyttårsball&quot; which means &quot;the new years ball.&quot; The students are not allowed to bring people from outside the school. In Norway it is the norm to have proms for 8th, 9th, and 10th graders at Norwegian middleschool and most of the time, there is no division between formal and grad – students can attend in whatever clothing they choose, such as traditional knee-long dresses.

====Poland====
In [[Poland]], the prom (''[[studniówka]]'') is a very popular event held each year throughout the country; the word itself means &quot;of or relating to 100 days&quot;. Most schools organise such an event about 100 days before the ([[matura]]) exams. The first dance of the prom is the [[polonaise]], a traditional Polish dance. Traditionally, the dress code for the ''[[studniówka]]'' was a typical school outfit, i.e. a white blouse with a dark skirt or trousers. Ass opposed to the ''[[studniówka]]'', the so-called Grand Ball (&quot;bal maturalny&quot;) was held after graduation, formal attire required. Nowadays, as Grand Balls are rare, the ''[[studniówka]]'' has adopted a formal dress code.

====Portugal====
In [[Portugal]], proms are held before the end of the year, in May or June and are called &quot;Baile de Finalistas&quot; (Finalist's Ball). The students wear formal suits and dresses. In some schools, the king and the queen of the prom are chosen. It is organised by a student association, elected in the beginning of the school year by the students to organise school events. After the prom, the students usually go to a club in order to have fun all night.

====Romania====
In [[Romania]] distinct proms are held each year in high schools and college for both the graduating students as well as the newly enrolled ones. They are called graduation balls and freshmen (&quot;boboci&quot;, meaning &quot;hatchlings&quot; in Romanian) balls, respectivelly. They are usually not black tie (informal). The venue is chosen by the teaching staff and can be any place, including the school gym or auditorium, a club, restaurant etc. It is common to charge students an admission tax in order to offset the cost. One or more bands or singers are usually hired to provide entertainment. Often the event is sponsored by local businesses. Access is usually controlled and limited to students of that particular high school or university, but exceptions can be made for relatives and it is not uncommon for students from other institutions to try to crash a particular prom. Freshmen proms usually include a popularity contest of some sort, which designates 3 girls and 3 boys as places I, II and III &quot;most popular&quot; as chosen by student vote; the candidates have to undergo various entertaining challenges, which usually include pair dancing. Generally speaking, freshmen proms are the more popular, with college freshmen proms often being publicized as club events and promoted by radio stations, who take the opportunity to introduce bands and singers. Whereas graduation proms are more subdued and often not a public or even a school-wide event, many graduating classes choosing to restrict attendance just to the actual graduates and their teachers.

====Russia, Belarus and Ukraine====
In [[Russia]], [[Belarus]] and [[Ukraine]] proms are called &quot;Vypusknyi vechir&quot;, which literally means &quot;evening of graduation.&quot; They take place from the 18th to the 20th or the 23rd to the 25th of June, after all state exams are completed. Proms are never held on the 21st/22nd because they took place on June 21 in 1941, but on the 22nd all graduates were drafted to fight the German invasion during [[World War II]]. First, all graduates receive their atestats (or diplomas). Students with higher marks receive them first. Afterward, the prom continues as a school ball, traditionally with classic dances. Students may choose restaurants, cafes, or ships rather than school grounds to hold the events. Proms may be held in a Discothèque, but it must start with the school waltz. At the conclusion of the prom evening, it is tradition to walk the whole night and watch sunrise in the morning (on a hill, if applicable, in Moscow&amp;nbsp;– [[Sparrow Hills]]).

====Slovakia====
In [[Slovakia]], the closest thing to a prom is Stužková, an occasion when the seniors get together with their parents, partners and teachers to celebrate their upcoming graduation. It takes place in November or December. Each of the students receives a green ribbon with their name on it (thus the name Stužková, the Ribbon Ball). The principal and the class teacher are given big green ribbons as well. Many of the students wear this ribbon on their jackets or shirts until graduation. Stužková typically includes a banquet, skits and songs prepared by students, and, of course, dancing. Men wear formal suits and women formal dresses. One week before Stužková is a ceremony of Pečatenie triednej knihy (Sealing of the Class-register) so that teachers will not give bad marks to students before Stužková. It is connected with some story and recorded by cameraman and then put on a DVD of Stužková. It usually starts at 6 p.m. and ends in the early hours of the next morning (4a.m.).

====Slovenia====
In [[Slovenia]], the equivalent is Maturantski ples. It is held before the final exams between January and May, depending on the region and school. Students can bring dates and/or close family to the ball. It is a custom that each student dances the last dance of the first sequence, a Vienna Walzer, with his mother/her father. There is also a dinner and live music.

====Spain====
In some places in Spain proms are also celebrated as parties after school. This parties are called commonly &quot;fiestas de graduación&quot;.

====Sweden====
In [[Sweden]], this kind of event is usually known as Studentbalen. The word &quot;Studentbalen&quot; is a [[proper noun]] meaning ''&quot;The Student Ball,&quot;'' while the word studentbal is a [[common noun]] that can refer to any formal dinner and dance at a Swedish university. Studentbalen is usually held during the final weeks before graduating and can be formal.

====Switzerland====
The [[Switzerland|Swiss]] equivalent of a prom is the ''bal de printemps''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ypulse.com/swiss-teens-celebrate-spring-with-bal-de-printemps |title=Swiss Teens Celebrate Spring With ‘Bal de Printemps’ |publisher=Ypulse |date=2009-04-28 |accessdate=2010-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Literally translated, this is a &quot;Spring Ball.&quot;  At some schools in the German speaking part, it is called &quot;Maturaball.&quot; This is not always organized by the schools, but sometimes by a student's committee. It takes mostly part before the final exams.

====Turkey====
In [[Turkey]], the equivalent is called &quot;Graduation Ball.&quot; The type of event and the rules applied are created by the student governments and school boards. It is a graduation tradition for seniors.

=== Oceania ===

In [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]], the tradition is similar to schools in the [[United States]]. However, if the event is not described to the final year, it may be described as a Ball, [[School Formal]], or simply Formal. If the event is in the final year of high school, it is sometimes called a Dinner-dance, Leavers' Dinner or Debutante Ball but is also commonly called a School Formal or &quot;Formal.&quot;  In Australia some schools may also have a Valedictory Dinner, which is like the formal but has students, parents and teachers instead of students and dates.

In addition to the high school graduation &quot;formal&quot; that marks the end of Year 12, there is also an event that is sometimes held to celebrate completing the [[School Certificate]] at the end of Year 10 (or Year 11 in New Zealand), and always held after receiving [[Higher School Certificate (New South Wales)|Higher School Certificate]] at the end of Year 12 and includes a dinner and dance. The NSW Government announced the abolition of the School Certificate after 2011, with students in year 10 that year being the final cohort to sit the external examinations and receive the qualification. Subsequent Year 10 &quot;Formals&quot; have been deemed &quot;unnecessary&quot; due to the fact that the majority of Year 10 students now progress to Year 11. In previous years when 25–30% of students left high school in Year 10, the Formal was seen as a celebration for those departing. In year 11, students occasionally organise a &quot;semi-formal&quot; at the end of the school year, which is a more casual version of a [[School formal|formal]]. The Valedictory Dinner (or Val as it is colloquially called) is an event that only occurs in Year 12. In New Zealand, most state school balls are held in the winter months, between June and August, while in Australia, a &quot;formal&quot; is held at the end of the year to mark the end of schooling, as is the Valedictory Dinner. Due to cultural differences, in New Zealand these 'balls' may be held consistently each year with the appropriate respect, but except for [[private school]]s they tend to be far less formal and 'proper' than in the US or Australia.

In [[American Samoa]] the typical Junior/Senior prom is held in most of the schools, an exception would be one of the private schools, which lets even 8th graders, freshmen, and sophomores participate in prom.

=== Central and South America and the Caribbean ===
In [[Venezuela]], they have prom as well, they call it &quot;promo&quot; derived from prom. It can consist of dancing, dinner and live music.

In [[Argentina]] there are &quot;fiestas de egresados&quot; for students finishing their last year of high school. These consist of big parties hosted by the senior students in local discos or other venues, starting at 10 p.m. until about 5 or 6 in the morning. They have dinner with parents and other members of the family, and after midnight friends and other guests join the dance. The parties start in late September, after most students come back from their senior trip to [[Bariloche]] and last until early December, after the graduation. The students dress formally.

In [[Brazil]], ''bailes de formatura'' are usual at the end of high school and at college graduation. There is no crowning of a &quot;king&quot; or a &quot;queen,&quot; but evening gowns and suits are required. Family may or may not be included, and there may be a live band or DJ hired to command the music.

In [[Chile]], proms, or &quot;fiestas de graduación&quot; (graduation parties), are usually held at convention centers or hotels after the &quot;licenciatura,&quot; or graduation from High School. They can also be held after taking the [[Prueba de Selección Universitaria|PSU]] (Chilean University Entrance Exam) in December. Students are expected to dress formally. They are allowed to go with dates or friends. After the dinner,the dance continues through the night into the next day.

In [[Colombia]] many private schools usually have prom balls as well, usually consisting of a dinner, dancing, live music, and contests. They are usually held at hotels or clubs.

In [[Costa Rica]], like many other American countries, the &quot;Baile de graduación&quot; is celebrated after finishing High School, where grade 11 is also the last year. It usually takes place before graduation to celebrate the end of school. It's normally held in hotels or saloons with a dance floor, music and dinner. It starts with the students walking through the dance floor and dancing a [[waltz]].  The dinner comes after, and the rest of the night consists of dancing and celebration.

In [[Honduras]], they are called &quot;Cena de Graduacion&quot;, they are held in luxury hotels, also familiars of the graduating students are invited. These event is held only for private schools, the act consists on a formal graduation and deliver of their diplomas, after that, a dinner is held between the graduating students and their familiars or friends in the same room which later will become in a dance floor for everyone.

In [[Peru]], proms—&quot;Fiestas de Promoción&quot;—are usually held at hotels, convention centers, or big residences. The dress code is formal. Some parents and teachers are often invited, but they don't stay the whole night. Dinner is served as well as alcoholic drinks and delicatessen. Breakfast is often served the next day, at around 6–7 am. There is a growing tradition to hold a &quot;Pre-Prom&quot; for the students in the class below the graduating class, and even a &quot;Pre-pre-Prom&quot; for the students in the class below that.

In [[Mexico]], most High Schools and Junior High (Middle School) have proms only allow the graduating class (Seniors) to have a prom, after a Church service for the graduating class. The students dress in Formal wear and attend in couples. Some Colleges have an after Graduation dinner dance.

In [[Trinidad and Tobago]] and most Caribbean countries, it is traditional for schools to hold a dance at the end of the [[CXC]]/[[GCE Advanced Level]] examination period. This is thrown simultaneously for fifth form and upper sixth form students during the months of June or July after the school's official graduation ceremony. It is colloquially referred to as &quot;grad&quot; or &quot;gradz.&quot;  Most &quot;gradz&quot; are held in popular clubs, hotels, halls or simply on the school's grounds. Most schools allow students to bring dates, and a formal dress code is usually in effect.

In [[Uruguay]], graduation parties are usually held after graduation itself. They may or may be not organised by the school, but by the students itself. Usually a place is rent, and formal parties are held. Students are allowed to take one guest, as a friend or as a partner.

== Homeschool proms ==

The concept of extending prom to homeschool students has been realized in recent years. Although some school districts in the [[United States]] and [[Canada]] allow homeschool students to attend the prom in the school district where they reside, many homeschool groups also organize their own proms. Some states, such as [[Oregon]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.oregonlive.com/tigard/index.ssf/2012/05/homeschool_prom_attracts_teens.html | work=The Oregonian | title=Home-school prom attracts teens from across Oregon | date=2012-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Georgia, Tennessee, and [[Michigan]], also host statewide homeschool proms, which any homeschool student in that state is welcome to attend.

Proms that are specifically geared toward homeschool students can sometimes be significantly different from traditional high school proms. It is not uncommon for a homeschool student to attend a homeschool prom solo, rather than taking a date. In many cases homeschool proms are very similar to public school proms.

== Adult proms ==
An adult prom is a social event that is almost perfectly similar to a high school prom in terms of themes and attire, except that some adult proms also serve [[alcoholic beverages]], and therefore most adult proms require those attending to be at least 21 years of age.

They have become increasingly common, especially in the [[United States]], and usually are hosted either as fundraisers for charities, or for-profit ventures.

A slightly different take on the adult prom is that of the disabilities prom, dedicated to providing a prom experience to disabled adults at no charge to the attendees. These events are most often organized by non-profit organizations focusing on the disabled, or large churches.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, [http://www.southeastchristian.org/Default.aspx?page=3683 &quot;Shine&quot;], a prom of this type organized by [[Southeast Christian Church (Louisville, Kentucky)|Southeast Christian Church]] in [[Middletown, Kentucky]].&lt;/ref&gt;

== Other prom-themed events ==
Sometimes, individuals re-create a prom-themed party either for themselves or a friend who didn't get to attend his or her prom.

[[Drew Barrymore]] has been known to host &quot;prom parties&quot; on at least two occasions, having once stated in an interview with [[Conan O'Brien]] in the late 1990s that she threw one for herself one time because she had always wanted a prom, but didn't get the chance, having not finished high school. In 2007, Barrymore threw a prom-themed birthday party for a close friend who had missed her senior prom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=AskMen.com Editors |url=http://www.askmen.com/celebs/entertainment-news/drew-barrymore/drew-barrymore-prom-party.html |title=Drew Barrymore's prom party |publisher=AskMen.com |date= |accessdate=2010-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, friends, family members, and hospital workers in [[Atlanta|Atlanta, Georgia]] re-created a prom for then-senior Raven Johnson, who was in a coma at the time of her original senior prom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.turnto10.com/jar/news/local/education/article/girl_gets_second_chance_to_attend_prom/13706/ |title=Girl gets second chance to attend prom |publisher=turnto10.com |date=2009-05-20 |accessdate=2010-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, Theatrical producers in [[New York City|New York]] produced an audience participation theatrical play, set in an actual dance hall, called The [[Awesome 80s Prom]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nyc.com/broadway_tickets/the_awesome_80s_prom.685030/editorial_review.aspx |title=The Awesome 80s Prom New York City.com : Broadway Tickets : Editorial Review |publisher=Nyc.com |date= |accessdate=2010-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; where attendees were at a prom and got to vote on the king and queen from the cast of characters.

== Anti-proms and alternative proms ==

[[Anti-prom]]s can be private, unofficial proms that are privately created, outside the control of the school, usually by people who disagree with their school's prom policies. Some schools also include the &quot;Anti Prom&quot; as an official event called MORP (Prom spelled backwards).  MORP dances can be similar to a [[Sadie Hawkins dance]] where the Girls ask a Boy date, informal attire, and the decor can be dark or less elegant reflecting the &quot;anti prom&quot; nature of MORP.

Adult proms for gay and lesbian adults who could not attend their proms with a date of the same sex are popular in some cities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/29565070/ |title=Gays, lesbians recreate prom at weekend fete |publisher=MSNBC |date=2009-03-07 |accessdate=2010-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 1980 [[Fricke v. Lynch|court decision]] required public schools to allow same-sex dates in the United States.

== Controversies ==

Over the course of history, proms have been the source of many controversies, many of which involve [[LGBT]] students.

*In 2002, gay teenager Marc Hall was prohibited from taking his male date to his high school's dance; Hall [[Marc Hall v. Durham Catholic School Board|sued the school board]] and won.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/story/2002/05/10/hall_020510.html |title=CBC News&amp;nbsp;– Gay teen wins fight over Catholic prom |publisher=Cbc.ca |date=2002-05-22 |accessdate=2010-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*In 2009, Tyler Frost was suspended for attending his girlfriend's prom, because his Christian high school disallowed dancing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/30669405 |title=Teen suspended for going to girlfriend's prom |publisher=MSNBC |date=2009-05-11 |accessdate=2010-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the principal at Frost's school signed a paper allowing Frost to attend the prom, he said Frost would be suspended if he went, but Frost did so anyway.

* In a [[2010 Itawamba County School District prom controversy]], lesbian high school senior [[Constance McMillen]] requested to take her girlfriend to the prom at [[Itawamba Agricultural High School]] in Fulton, Mississippi, where they were both students. The principal denied her request and prohibited her from wearing a tuxedo. When McMillen challenged the school's policy, the prom was canceled, leading McMillen to sue the school.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Joyner |first=Chris |url=http://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2010-03-20-gay-mississippi-teen_N.htm |title=Lesbian gets day in court over nixed prom |publisher=Usatoday.Com |date=2010-03-22 |accessdate=2010-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following a court decision forcing the school to hold the prom, local parents organized a second prom in secret, leaving Constance, her girlfriend and only 5 other students at the official prom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.advocate.com/News/Daily_News/2010/04/05/ACLU_Investigating_Fake_Prom/ |title=McMillen: I Was Sent to Fake Prom |publisher=Advocate.Com |date=2010-04-05 |accessdate=2010-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*In 2014, student Katie Bialy from [[Holy Cross Catholic Secondary School (St. Catharines)]] with the genetic condition [[Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome]] (EDS) was not allowed to go to prom by her school principal Denice Robertson because her grades were not as good as required and she could not graduate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=‘It wasn’t fair’: Why an Ontario school isn’t letting a sick girl go to prom|url=http://globalnews.ca/news/1308050/it-wasnt-fair-why-an-ontario-school-isnt-letting-a-sick-girl-go-to-prom/|publisher=Global News|first=Cindy|last=Pom}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her condition had impaired her ability to do schoolwork and she asked the principal if she could go as a guest, but the principal refused her the option. This incident has resulted in public support for Bialy in social media and also increased awareness of her condition.

A '''robe''' is a  loose-fitting outer [[clothing|garment]]. Unlike garments described as [[cape]]s or [[cloak]]s, robes usually have [[sleeve]]s. The [[English language|English]] word ''robe'' derives from [[Middle English]] ''robe'' (&quot;garment&quot;), [[loanword|borrowed]] from [[Old French]] ''robe'' (&quot;booty, spoils&quot;), itself taken from the [[Old Frankish|Frankish]] word *''rouba'' (&quot;spoils, things stolen, clothes&quot;), and is related to the word ''rob''. There are various types of robes, including:

* A gown worn as part of the [[academic regalia]] of [[Faculty (teaching staff)|faculty]] or [[students]], especially for ceremonial occasions, such as a [[convocation]]s, [[Wiktionary:congregation|congregations]] or [[graduation]]s.
* A gown worn as part of the attire of a [[judge]] or [[barrister]].
* A wide variety of long, flowing [[religious dress]] including [[pulpit robe]]s and the robes worn by various types of [[monk]]s.
* A gown worn as part of the official dress of a [[peerage|peer]] or [[Royal Family|royalty]].
* Any of several women's fashions, as ''robe d'anglaise'' (18th century), &quot;[[robe de style]]&quot; (1920s).
* A gown worn in [[fantasy literature]] and [[role-playing games]] by [[Wizard (fantasy)|wizards]] and other [[magic (paranormal)|magical]] [[fictional character|character]]s.
* A &quot;[[bathrobe]]&quot; worn mostly after bathing or swimming. A typical bathrobe is made of an absorbent material such as [[towelling]], and might be worn at home after a bath, to keep warm and preserve [[modesty]] if there is no need to dress. A similar garment not made of absorbent material might be called a dressing gown or housecoat.  See, for example, that worn by the fictional character [[Arthur Dent]].
* (Informal usage) Any long flowing garment; for example, a [[cassock]] is sometimes called a ''robe'', although a cassock is close-fitting.

A '''shirt''' is a cloth garment for the upper body.

Originally an [[undergarment]] worn exclusively by men, it has become, in [[American English]], a catch-all term for a broad variety of upper-body garments and undergarments. In [[British English]], a shirt is more specifically a garment with a [[collar (clothing)|collar]], sleeves with [[cuff]]s, and a full vertical opening with buttons or snaps (North Americans would call that a &quot;[[dress shirt]]&quot;, a specific type of &quot;collared shirt&quot;). A shirt can also be worn with a [[necktie]] under the shirt collar.

== History ==
The world's oldest preserved garment, discovered by [[Flinders Petrie]], is a &quot;highly sophisticated&quot; linen shirt from a First Dynasty Egyptian tomb at [[Tarkhan (Egypt)|Tarkan]], c. 3000 BC: &quot;the shoulders and sleeves have been finely pleated to give form-fitting trimness while allowing the wearer room to move. The small fringe formed during weaving along one edge of the cloth has been placed by the designer to decorate the neck opening and side seam.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Barber, Elizabeth Wayland (1994). ''Women's Work. The first 20,000 Years'', p.135.Norton &amp; Company, New York. ISBN 0-393-31348-4&lt;/ref&gt;

The shirt was an item of men's underwear until the twentieth century.&lt;ref name=&quot;William L. Brown III 1999. p. 7&quot;&gt;William L. Brown III, &quot;Some Thoughts on Men's Shirts in America, 1750-1900&quot;, Thomas Publications, Gettysburg, PA 1999. ISBN 1-57747-048-6, p. 7&lt;/ref&gt;  Although the woman's [[chemise]] was a closely related garment to the man's, it is the man's garment that became the modern shirt.&lt;ref&gt;Dorothy K. Burnham, &quot;Cut My Cote&quot;, Royal Ontario Museum, Toronto, Ontario 1973. ISBN 0-88854-046-9, p. 14&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Middle Ages]], it was a plain, undyed garment worn next to the skin and under regular garments. In medieval artworks, the shirt is only visible (uncovered) on humble characters, such as [[shepherd]]s, prisoners, and [[Penance|penitents]].&lt;ref&gt;C. Willett and Phillis Cunnington, ''The History of Underclothes'', Dover Publications Inc., New York 1992. ISBN 0-486-27124-2 pp. 23–25&lt;/ref&gt;  In the seventeenth century, men's shirts were allowed to show, with much the same [[Eroticism|erotic]] import as visible underwear today.&lt;ref&gt;C. Willett and Phillis Cunnington, ''The History of Underclothes'', Dover Publications Inc., New York 1992. ISBN 0-486-27124-2 pp. 54&lt;/ref&gt; In the eighteenth century, instead of underpants, men &quot;relied on the long tails of shirts ... to serve the function of drawers.&lt;ref&gt;Linda Baumgarten, &quot;What Clothes Reveal: The Language of Clothing in Colonial and Federal America&quot;, The Colonial Williamsburg Foundation, Williamsburg, Virginia, in association with the [[Yale University Press]], New Haven, Connecticut 2002, ISBN 0-300-09580-5, p. 27&lt;/ref&gt;  Eighteenth-century costume historian [[Joseph Strutt (engraver and antiquary)|Joseph Strutt]] believed that men who did not wear shirts to bed were indecent.&lt;ref&gt;Linda Baumgarten, &quot;What Clothes Reveal: The Language of Clothing in Colonial and Federal America&quot;, The Colonial Williamsburg Foundation, Williamsburg, Virginia, in association with the [[Yale University Press]], New Haven, Connecticut 2002, ISBN 0-300-09580-5, pp. 20-22&lt;/ref&gt;  Even as late as 1879, a visible shirt with nothing over it was considered improper.&lt;ref name=&quot;William L. Brown III 1999. p. 7&quot;/&gt;

The shirt sometimes had frills at the neck or cuffs.  In the sixteenth century, men's shirts often had [[embroidery]], and sometimes frills or [[lace]] at the neck and cuffs and through the eighteenth century long neck frills, or [[Jabot (neckwear)|jabots]], were fashionable.&lt;ref&gt;C. Willet and Phillis Cunnington, &quot;The History of Underclothes&quot;, Dover Publications Inc., New York 1992. ISBN 0-486-27124-2 pp. 36–39&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;C. Willet and Phillis Cunnington, &quot;The History of Underclothes&quot;, Dover Publications Inc., New York 1992. ISBN 0-486-27124-2 pp. 73&lt;/ref&gt; Coloured shirts began to appear in the early nineteenth century, as can be seen in the paintings of [[George Caleb Bingham]].  They were considered casual wear, for lower-class workers only, until the twentieth century.  For a gentleman, &quot;to wear a sky-blue shirt was unthinkable in 1860 but had become standard by 1920 and, in 1980, constituted the most commonplace event.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Michel Pastoureau and Jody Gladding (translator), &quot;The Devil's Cloth: A History of Stripes&quot;, Columbia University Press, New York 2001 ISBN 0-7434-5326-3, p. 65&lt;/ref&gt;

European and American women began wearing shirts in 1860, when the [[Garibaldi shirt]], a red shirt as worn by the freedom fighters under [[Giuseppe Garibaldi]], was popularized by [[Eugénie de Montijo|Empress Eugénie]] of France.&lt;ref&gt;Anne Buck, &quot;Victorian Costume&quot;, Ruth Bean Publishers, Carlton, Bedford, England 1984. ISBN 0-903585-17-0&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Young, Julia Ditto, &quot;The Rise of the Shirt Waist&quot;, ''[[Good Housekeeping]]'', May 1902, pp. 354–357&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of the nineteenth century, the ''[[Century Dictionary]]'' described an ordinary shirt as &quot;of cotton, with linen bosom, wristbands and cuffs prepared for stiffening with starch, the collar and wristbands being usually separate and adjustable&quot;.

== Types ==
[[File:Shirt-types.svg|thumb|upright|Three types of shirt]]

Baldt, A.M., ''Clothing for Women: Selection, Design and Construction'', J.B. Lippincott Company, Philadelphia, PA 1924 (second edition), p. 312&lt;/ref&gt; in contemporary usage, a woman's dress cut like a men's dress shirt to the waist, then extended into dress length at the bottom
* [[Nightshirt]] – often oversized, ruined or inexpensive light cloth undergarment shirt for [[sleep]]ing.

== Parts of shirt ==
Many terms are used to describe and differentiate types of shirts (and upper-body garments in general) and their construction. The smallest differences may have significance to a cultural or occupational group. Recently, (late twentieth century) it has become common to use tops to carry messages or advertising. Many of these distinctions apply to other upper-body garments, such as [[Coat (clothing)|coats]] and [[sweaters]].

=== Shoulders and arms ===

==== Sleeves ====
{{Main|sleeves}}
Shirts may:
* have no covering of the shoulders or arms&amp;nbsp;– a [[tube top]] (not reaching higher than the armpits, staying in place by elasticity)
* have only shoulder straps, such as [[spaghetti strap]]s
* cover the shoulders, but without [[sleeve]]s
* have shoulderless sleeves, short or long, with or without shoulder straps, that expose the shoulders, but cover the rest of the arm from the biceps and triceps down to at least the elbow
* have short sleeves, varying from cap sleeves (covering only the shoulder and not extending below the armpit) to half sleeves (elbow length), with some having quarter-length sleeves (reaching to a point that covers half of the biceps and triceps area)
* have three-quarter-length sleeves (reaching to a point between the elbow and the wrist)
* have long sleeves (reaching a point to the wrist to a little beyond wrist)

==== Cuffs ====
{{Main|cuff}}
Shirts with long sleeves may further be distinguished by the [[cuff]]s:
* no [[button]]s&amp;nbsp;– a closed placket cuff
* buttons (or analogous fasteners such as [[snap fastener|snaps]])&amp;nbsp;– single or multiple. A single button or pair aligned parallel with the [[cuff]] hem is considered a [[button cuff]]. Multiple buttons aligned perpendicular to the [[cuff]] hem, or parallel to the [[placket]] constitute a [[barrel cuff]].
* buttonholes designed for [[cufflink]]s
** a [[French cuff]], where the end half of the [[cuff]] is folded over the [[cuff]] itself and fastened with a [[cufflink]]. This type of [[cuff]] has four buttons and a short [[placket]].
** more formally, a link cuff&amp;nbsp;– fastened like a [[French cuff]], except is not folded over, but instead hemmed, at the edge of the sleeve.
* asymmetrical designs, such as one-shoulder, one-sleeve or with sleeves of different lengths.

=== Lower hem ===
* hanging to the [[waist]]
* leaving the [[navel|belly button]] area [[Nudity|bare]] (much more common for women than for men). See [[halfshirt]].
* covering the [[crotch]]
* covering part of the legs (essentially this is a [[dress]]; however, a piece of clothing is perceived either as a shirt (worn with [[trousers]]) or as a dress (in [[Western culture]] mainly worn by women)).
* going to the floor (as a pajama shirt)

=== Body ===
* vertical opening on the front side, all the way down, with [[button]]s or [[zipper]]. When fastened with buttons, this opening is often called the [[Placket|placket front]].
* similar opening, but in back.
* left and right front side not separable, put on over the head; with regard to upper front side opening:
** V-shaped permanent opening on the top of the front side
** no opening at the upper front side
** vertical opening on the upper front side with buttons or zipper
*** men's shirts are often buttoned on the right whereas women's are often buttoned on the left.

=== Neck ===
* with polo-neck
* with &quot;scoop&quot; neck
* with v-neck but no collar
* with plunging neck
* with open or tassel neck
* with [[collar (clothing)|collar]]
** windsor collar or '''spread collar'''&amp;nbsp;– a dressier collar designed with a wide distance between points (the '''spread''') to accommodate the [[windsor knot]] tie. The standard business collar.
** tab collar&amp;nbsp;– a collar with two small fabric tabs that fasten together behind a tie to maintain collar spread.
** [[wing collar]]&amp;nbsp;– best suited for the bow tie, often only worn for very formal occasions.
** straight collar&amp;nbsp;– or '''point collar''', a version of the windsor collar that is distinguished by a narrower spread to better accommodate the [[four-in-hand knot]], [[pratt knot]], and the half-windsor knot. A moderate dress collar.
** [[button-down collar]]&amp;nbsp;– A collar with buttons that fasten the points or tips to a shirt. The most casual of collars worn with a tie.
** [[band collar]]&amp;nbsp;– essentially the lower part of a normal collar, first used as the original collar to which a separate collarpiece was attached. Rarely seen in modern fashion. Also casual.
** [[Polo neck|turtle neck collar]]&amp;nbsp;– A collar that covers most of the throat.
* without collar
*** V-neck no collar&amp;nbsp;– The neckline protrudes down the chest and to a point, creating a &quot;V&quot; looking neck line.

=== Other features ===
* '''[[pocket]]s'''&amp;nbsp;– how many (if any), where, and with regard to closure: not closable, just a flap, or with a [[button]] or [[zipper]].
* with or without [[Hood (headgear)|hood]]

Some combinations are not applicable, e.g. a tube top cannot have a collar.

== Types of fabric ==
There are two main categories of fibres used: natural fibre and man-made fibre (synthetics or petroleum based).
Some natural fibres are linen, the first used historically, [[hemp]], [[cotton]], the most used, [[ramie]], [[wool]], [[silk]] and more recently [[bamboo]] or [[Soy fabric|soya]]. Some synthetic fibres are [[polyester]], [[tencel]], [[viscose]], etc. Polyester mixed with cotton (poly-cotton) is often used. Fabrics for shirts are called shirtings. The four main weaves for shirtings are [[plain weave]], [[oxford (cloth)|oxford]], [[twill]] and [[satin]]. [[Broadcloth]], [[poplin]] and [[end-on-end]] are variations of the plain weave. After weaving, [[finishing (textiles)|finishing]] can be applied to the fabric.

== Shirts and politics ==
{{See also|Political colour}}
In the 1920s and 1930s, [[fascists]] wore different coloured shirts:
* [[Black shirts]] were used by the [[Italian Fascism|Italian fascists]], and in Britain, Finland and Germany and Croatia. The party leaders of [[Dravidar Kazhagam]] in India wear only black shirts to symbolise atheism.
* [[Brownshirts]] were worn by German Nazis of the SA.
* The [[Blueshirts]] was a fascist movement in Ireland and Canada, and the colour of the Portuguese ''[[National Syndicalists (Portugal)|Nacional Sindicalistas]]'', the Spanish ''[[Falange Española]]'', the French ''[[Solidarité Française]]'', and the Chinese [[Blue Shirts Society]].
* [[Greenshirts (disambiguation)|Green shirts]] were used in Hungary, Ireland, Romania, Brazil and Portugal.
* ''[[Camisas Doradas]]'' (golden shirts) were used in [[Mexico]].
* Red shirts were worn by the racist and antisemitic Bulgarian [[Ratniks]].
* [[Silver Shirts]] were worn in the United States of America.

In addition, [[redshirt (disambiguation)|red shirts]] have been used to symbolize a variety of different political groups, including [[Garibaldi]]'s Italian revolutionaries, nineteenth century American street gangs, and [[socialist]] militias in Spain and Mexico during the 1930s.

In the UK, the [[Social Credit]] movement of the thirties wore green shirts.

[[File:Bar-P1030319.jpg|thumb|A bar in Switzerland.]]

A '''bar''' (also known as a '''saloon''' or a '''tavern''' or sometimes a '''pub''' or '''club''', referring to the actual establishment, as in '''pub bar''' or '''club bar''' etc.) is a [[retail]] [[Business|business establishment]] that serves [[alcoholic beverage]]s, such as [[beer]], [[wine]], [[Distilled beverage|liquor]], [[cocktail]]s, and other [[beverages]] like [[mineral water]] and [[soft drink]]s and often sell snack foods, like [[crisps]] or [[peanut]]s, for consumption on premises.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thefreedictionary.com/cocktail+lounge Cocktail Lounge definition] from [http://www.thefreedictionary.com/ The Free Dictionary]&lt;/ref&gt; Some types of bars, such as pubs, may also serve food from a [[restaurant]] menu.

Bars provide [[Bar stool|stools]] or chairs that are placed at tables or counters for their patrons. Some bars have entertainment such as a live band, Bars that offer entertainment or live music are often referred to as music bars, live venues, or nightclubs. Types of bars range from inexpensive [[dive bar]]s&lt;ref name=dive&gt;Todd Dayton, {{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LpUSVjBPHRwC&amp;pg=PT7&amp;dq=the+ideal+dive#v=onepage&amp;q=the%20ideal%20dive&amp;f=false |title=''San Francisco's Best Dive Bars'', page 4 |publisher=Ig Publishing, 2009
ISBN 097031258X |accessdate=2010-07-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; to elegant places of entertainment often accompanying restaurants for dining.

Many bars have a discount period, designated a &quot;[[happy hour]]&quot; to encourage off-peak-time patronage. Bars that fill to capacity sometimes implement a [[cover charge]] or a minimum drink purchase requirement during their peak hours. Bars may have [[Bouncer (doorman)|bouncers]] to ensure patrons are of legal age, to eject drunk or fighting patrons, and to collect cover charges. Such bars often feature entertainment, which may be a [[Musical band|live band]], [[vocalist]], [[comedian]], or [[disc jockey]] playing recorded music.

The term &quot;bar&quot; is derived from the [[bar (counter)|specialized counter]] on which drinks are served. Patrons may sit or stand at the bar and be served by the [[bartender]]. Depending on the size of a bar and its approach, alcohol may be served at the bar by bartenders, at tables by [[Waiting staff|server]]s, or by a combination of the two. The &quot;back bar&quot; is a set of shelves of glasses and bottles behind that counter.  In some establishments, the back bar is elaborately decorated with woodwork, [[etched glass]], mirrors, and lights.

==History==
[[File:A cross roads store, bar, juke joint, and gas station in Melrose, Louisiana, 1944.jpg|thumb|left||A [[Great Depression|Depression-era]] bar in [[Melrose, Louisiana]].]]

There have been many different names for public drinking spaces throughout history. In the colonial era of the United States taverns were an important meeting place, as most other institutions were weak. During the 19th century saloons were very important to the leisure time of the working class.&lt;ref&gt;John M. Kingsdale, “The 'Poor Man's Club': Social Functions of the Urban-Working Class Saloon,” in ''American Quarterly'', Vol. 25, No. 4. (Oct., 1973)&lt;/ref&gt; Today, even when an establishment uses a different name, such as &quot;tavern&quot; or &quot;saloon&quot;, the area of the establishment where the bartender pours or mixes beverages is normally called &quot;the bar.&quot;

The sale and/or consumption of alcoholic beverages was prohibited in the first half of the 20th century in several countries, including [[Finland]], [[Iceland]], [[Norway]], and the [[United States]]. In the United States, illegal bars during [[Prohibition in the United States|Prohibition]] were called [[Speakeasy|speakeasies]] or [[Speakeasy#Blind pigs and blind tigers|blind pig]]s.
{{Clear left}}

==Legal restrictions==
Laws in many jurisdictions prohibit [[Minor (law)|minors]] from entering a bar. If those under [[legal drinking age]] are allowed to enter, as is the case with pubs that serve food, they are not allowed to drink. In some jurisdictions, bars cannot serve a patron who is already intoxicated. Cities and towns usually have legal restrictions on where bars may be located and on the types of alcohol they may serve to their customers. Some bars may have a license to serve beer and wine, but not hard liquor. In some jurisdictions, patrons buying alcohol must also order food. In some jurisdictions, bar owners have a legal liability for the conduct of patrons who they serve (this liability may arise in cases of [[impaired driving]] which cause injuries or deaths).

Many [[Muslim]] countries prohibit bars as well as the possession or sale of alcohol for religious reasons, while others, including [[Qatar]] and the [[United Arab Emirates]], do allow bars in some specific areas but only permit non-Muslims to drink in them.

==Types==
A bar's owners and managers choose the bar's name, décor, drink menu, lighting, and other elements which they think will attract a certain kind of patron. However, they have only limited influence over who patronizes their establishment. Thus, a bar originally intended for one demographic profile can become popular with another. For example, a [[gay bar]] with a dance or disco floor might, over time, attract an increasingly heterosexual clientele. Or a [[blues]] bar may become a [[biker bar]] if most its patrons are bikers.

A cocktail lounge is an upscale bar that is typically located within a hotel, restaurant, or airport.

A full bar serves liquor, cocktails, wine, and beer.

A [[wine bar]] is an elegant bar that focuses on wine rather than on beer or liquor. Patrons of these bars may [[Wine tasting|taste wines]] before deciding to buy them. Some wine bars also serve small plates of food or other snacks.

A beer bar focuses on beer, particularly [[craft beer]], rather than on wine or liquor. A [[brew pub]] has an on-site brewery and serves craft beers.

&quot;[[Fern bar]]&quot; is an American slang term for an upscale or [[preppy]] (or [[yuppie]]) bar.

A [[music bar]] is a bar that presents live music as an attraction.

A [[dive bar]], often referred to simply as a &quot;dive,&quot; is a very informal bar which may be considered by some to be disreputable.

===Entertainment===
Bars categorized by the kind of entertainment they offer:

* [[Blues]] bars, specializing in the live blues style of music.
* [[Comedy club|Comedy bars]], specializing in stand-up comedy entertainment.
* [[Dance bar]]s, which have a dance floor where patrons dance to recorded music. But if a dance bar has a large dance floor and hires well-known professional [[DJ]]s, it is considered to be a [[nightclub]] or [[discothèque]].
* [[Karaoke]] bars, with nightly karaoke as entertainment.
* Music bars, specializing in live music (i.e. concerts).
* Drag bars, which have live shows, where men dress as women and generally lip-sync to recordings of female vocal artists.
* Salsa bars, where patrons dance to Latin [[salsa music]].
* Sports bars, where sports fans watch games on large-screen televisions.
* Topless bars, where [[Toplessness|topless]] female employees dance or serve drinks.

===Patrons===
Bars categorized by the kind of patrons who frequent them:

* Biker bars, which are bars frequented by motorcycle enthusiasts and (in some regions) motorcycle club members
* College bars, usually located in or near universities, where most of the patrons are students.
* Neighborhood bars, a bar that most of the patrons know each other; it is generally close to home and is frequented regularly
* Cop bars, where off-duty law enforcement agents gather
*[[Gay bar]]s, where gay men or women dance and socialize
* Mixed gay/straight bars, mainly targeting [[bisexual]]s
* Singles bars where (mostly) unmarried people of both sexes can meet and socialize
* Women's bars
* Sports bars, where sports fans gather to cheer on their favorite teams with other like minded fans

==Bar (counter)==

[[File:Liquor and wine bottles behind a bar in Baden, Austria.jpg|thumb|Liquor and wine bottles behind a bar in Baden, Austria]]

The [[Countertop|counter]] at which drinks are served by a [[bartender]] is called &quot;the bar.&quot; This term is applied, as a [[synecdoche]], to drinking establishments called &quot;bars.&quot; This counter typically stores a variety of [[beer]]s, [[wine]]s, [[distilled beverage|liquors]], and non-alcoholic ingredients, and is organized to facilitate the bartender's work.

The word &quot;bar&quot; in this context was already in use in 1591 when [[Robert Greene (dramatist)|Robert Greene]], a dramatist, referred to one in his ''A Notable Discovery of Coosnage''.

Counters for serving other types of food and drink may also be called bars. Examples of this usage of the word include [[snack bar]]s, [[sushi]] bars, [[Juice#Juice bar|juice bars]], [[salad bar]]s, [[Milk bar|dairy bars]] and [[sundae]] bars.

{{Unreferenced section|date=July 2009}}

In Australia the major form of licensed commercial alcohol outlet from the colonial period to the present was the [[pub]], a local variant of the English original. Until the 1970s, Australian pubs were traditionally organised into gender-segregated drinking areas—the &quot;public bar&quot; was  only open to men, while the &quot;lounge bar&quot; or &quot;saloon bar&quot; served both men and women (i.e. mixed drinking). This distinction was gradually eliminated as anti-discrimination legislation and women's rights activism broke down the concept of a public drinking area accessible to only men. Where two bars still exist in the one establishment, one (that derived from the &quot;public bar&quot;) will be more [[downmarket]] while the other (deriving from the &quot;lounge bar&quot;) will be more upmarket. Over time, with the introduction of [[slot machine|gaming machines]] into hotels, many &quot;lounge bars&quot; have or are being converted into gaming rooms.

Beginning in the mid-1950s, the formerly strict state liquor licensing laws were progressively relaxed and reformed, with the result that pub trading hours were extended. This was in part to eliminate the social problems associated with early closing times—notably the infamous &quot;[[Six O'Clock Swill]]&quot;—and the thriving trade in &quot;sly grog&quot; (illicit alcohol sales). More licensed liquor outlets began to appear, including retail &quot;bottle shops&quot; (over-the-counter bottle sales were previously only available at pubs and were strictly controlled). Particularly in Sydney, a new class of licensed premises, the wine bar, appeared; there alcohol could be served on the proviso that it was provided in tandem with a meal. These venues became very popular in the late 1960s and early 1970s and many offered free entertainment, becoming an important facet of the Sydney music scene in that period.

In the major Australian cities today there is a large and diverse bar scene with a range of ambiences, modes and styles catering for every echelon of cosmopolitan society.

===Canada===
Public drinking began with the establishment of colonial taverns in both the U.S and Canada. While the term changed to Public house especially in the U.K.  The term Tavern tavern continued to be used instead of Pub in both the U.S and Canada.
Public drinking establishments were banned by the [[Prohibition]] of alcohol, which was (and is) a provincial jurisdiction. Prohibition was repealed, province by province in the 1920s. There was not a universal right to consume alcohol, and only males of legal age were permitted to do so. &quot;Beer parlours&quot; were common in the wake of prohibition, with local laws often not permitting entertainment (such as the playing of games or music) in these establishments, which were set aside for the purpose solely of consuming alcohol.

Since the end of the Second World War, and exposure by roughly one million Canadians to the [[public house]] traditions common in the UK by servicemen and women serving there, those traditions became more common in Canada. These traditions include the drinking of dark ales and stouts, the &quot;pub&quot; as a social gathering place for both sexes, and the playing of games (such as darts, snooker or pool). Tavern became extremely popular during the 1960s and 1970s, especially for working-class people. Canadian taverns, which can still be found in remote regions of Northern Canada, have long tables with benches lining the sides. Patrons in these taverns often order beer in large quart bottles and drink inexpensive &quot;bar brand&quot; Canadian rye whisky. In some provinces, taverns used to have separate entrances for men and women. Even in a large city like Toronto the separate entrances existed into the early 1970s.

Canada has adopted some of the newer U.S. bar traditions (such as the &quot;sports bar&quot;) of the last decades. As a result, the term &quot;bar&quot; has come to be differentiated from the term &quot;pub&quot;, in that bars are usually 'themed' and sometimes have a dance floor. Bars with dance floors are usually relegated to small or Suburban communities. In larger cities bars with large dance floors are usually refereed to as clubs and are strictly for dancing, Establishments which call themselves pubs are often much more similar to a British pub in style. Before the 1980s, most &quot;bars&quot; were referred to simply as &quot;tavern&quot;.

Often, bars and pubs in Canada will cater to supporters of a local sporting team, usually a hockey team. There is a difference between the sports bar and the pub; sports bars focus on TV screens showing games and showcasing uniforms, equipment, etc. Pubs will generally also show games but do not exclusively focus on them. The Tavern was popular until the early 1980s, when American-style bars, as we know them today became popular. In the 1990s imitation British- and Irish-style pubs become popular and adopted names like &quot;The Fox and Fiddle&quot; and &quot;The Queen and Beaver&quot; reflect naming trends in Britain. The Tavern/pub style mixed food and drink establishment are generally more common in Canada than bars although both can be found.

Legal restrictions on bars are set by the Canadian provinces and territories, which has led to a great deal of variety. While some provinces have been very restrictive with their bar regulation, setting strict closing times and banning the removal of alcohol from the premises, other provinces have been more liberal. Closing times generally run from 2:00 to 4:00&amp;nbsp;a.m.

In [[Nova Scotia]], particularly in [[City of Halifax|Halifax]], there was, until the 1980s, a very distinct system of gender-based laws were in effect for decades. Taverns, bars, halls, and other classifications differentiated whether it was exclusively for men or women, men with invited women, vice versa, or mixed. After this fell by the wayside, there was the issue of [[water closet]]s. This led to many taverns adding on &quot;powder rooms;&quot; sometimes they were constructed later, or used parts of kitchens or upstairs halls, if plumbing allowed. This was also true of conversions in former &quot;sitting rooms,&quot; for men's facilities.

===Italy===
[[File:Bar bus terminal.JPG|thumb|The bar in the coach terminal at [[Udine]], Italy.]]

In Italy, a &quot;bar&quot; is a place more similar to a ''[[café]]'', where people go during the morning or the afternoon, usually to drink a [[coffee]], a [[cappuccino]], a [[hot chocolate]] and eat some kind of snack like pastries and sandwiches (''panini'' or ''tramezzini'').  However, any kind of alcoholic beverages are served.  Opening hours vary: some establishments are open very early in the morning and close relatively early in the evening; others, especially if next to a theater or a cinema, may be open until late at night. Many larger bars are also restaurants and disco clubs.
Many Italian bars have introduced a so-called &quot;[[aperitif|aperitivo]]&quot; time in the evening, in which everyone who purchases an alcoholic drink then has free access to a usually abundant buffet of cold dishes like pasta salads, vegetables and various types of appetizers.

===Spain===
Bars in Spain are common and form an important part in Spanish culture. In Spain it is common for a town to have many bars and even to have several lined up in the same street. Most bars have a section of the street or plaza outside with tables and chairs with parasols if the weather allows it. Spanish bars are also known for serving a wide range of sandwiches (bocadillos), as well as snacks called [[tapas]] or [[pincho]]s.

Tapas and pinchos may be offered to customers in two ways, either complementary to order a drink or in some cases there are charged independently, either case this is usually clearly indicated to bar customers by display of wall information, on menus and price lists.
The anti-smoking law has entered in effect January 1, 2011 and since that date it is prohibited to smoke in bars and restaurants as well as all other indoor areas, closed commercial and state owned facilities are now smoke-free areas.

Spain is the country with the highest ratio of bars/population with almost 6 bars per thousand inhabitants, that's 3 times UK's ratio and 4 times Germany's, and it alone has double the number of bars than the oldest of the 15-members of the [[European Union]]. The meaning of the word 'bar' in Spain, however, does not have the negative connotation inherent in the same word in many other languages. For Spanish people a bar is essentially a meeting place, and not necessarily a place to engage in the consumption of alcoholic beverages. As a result, children are normally allowed into bars, and it is common to see families in bars during week-ends of the end of the day. In small towns, the 'bar' may constitute the very center of social life, and it is customary that, after social events, people go to bars, including seniors and children alike.

===United Kingdom===
[[File:Chapel Bar, Tunbridge Wells - geograph.org.uk - 1736938.jpg|thumb|upright|The Chapel Bar in [[England]].]]

In the UK, bars are either areas that serve alcoholic drinks within establishments such as hotels, restaurants, universities, or are a particular type of establishment which serves alcoholic drinks such as wine bars, &quot;style bars&quot;, private membership only bars. However the main type of establishment selling alcohol for consumption on the premises is the [[public house]] or ''pub''. Some bars are similar to nightclubs in that they feature loud music, subdued lighting, or operate a dress code and admissions policy, with inner city bars generally having door staff at the entrance.

'Bar' also designates a separate drinking area within a pub. Until recent years most pubs had two or more bars - very often the Public bar/Tap room, and the Saloon Bar/Lounge, where the decor was better and prices were sometimes higher. The designations of the bars varied regionally. In the last two decades many pub interiors have been opened up into single spaces, which some people regret as it loses the flexibility, intimacy and traditional feel of a multi-roomed public house.

One of the last [[dive bar]]s in London was underneath the Kings Head pub in Gerrard Street, [[Soho]].

===United States===
[[File:Club Moderne bar Anaconda Montana.jpg|thumb|left|The bar of the Club Moderne in [[Anaconda, Montana|Anaconda]], [[Montana]].]]

In the United States, legal distinctions often exist between restaurants and bars, and even between types of bars. These distinctions vary from state to state, and even among municipalities. ''Beer bars'' (sometimes called [[tavern]]s or [[pub]]s) are legally restricted to selling only beer, and possibly wine or cider. ''Liquor bars'', also simply called ''bars'', also sell [[Distilled beverage|hard liquor]].

Bars are sometimes exempt from [[smoking ban]]s that restaurants are subject to, even if those restaurants have liquor licenses. The distinction between a restaurant that serves liquor and a bar is usually made by the percentage of revenue earned from selling liquor, although increasingly, smoking bans include bars too.
[[File:Bar in New Haven, CT, March 3, 2008.jpg|thumb|upright|A bar named “Bar” in [[New Haven, Connecticut]].]]
In most places, bars are prohibited from selling alcoholic beverages ''to go'' and this makes them clearly different from [[liquor store]]s.  Some [[brewpubs]] and [[wineries]] can serve alcohol ''to go'', but under the rules applied to a liquor store. In some areas, such as [[New Orleans]] and parts of [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]] and [[Savannah, Georgia]], open containers of alcohol may be prepared ''to go''. This kind of restriction is usually dependent on an [[open container law]]. In [[Pennsylvania]] and [[Ohio]], bars may sell [[wikt:six-pack|six-pack]]s of beer &quot;to-go&quot; in original (sealed) containers by obtaining a take-out license. [[New Jersey]] permits all forms of packaged goods to be sold at bars, and permits packaged beer and wine to be sold at any time on-premises sales of alcoholic beverages are allowed.

During the 19th century, drinking establishments were called ''saloons''. In the [[American Old West]] the most popular establishment in town was usually the [[Western saloon]]. Many of these Western saloons survive, though their services and features have changed with the times. Newer establishments have sometimes been built in Western saloon style for a nostalgic effect. In American cities there were also numerous saloons, which allowed only male patrons and were usually owned by one of the major breweries. [[Drunkenness]], fights and [[alcoholism]] made the saloon into a powerful symbol of all that was wrong with alcohol.&lt;ref&gt;Burns, Ken, and Novick, Lynn, ''Prohibition'', 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Saloons were the primary target of the [[Temperance movement]], and the [[Anti-Saloon League]], founded in 1892, was the most powerful lobby in favor of [[Prohibition in the United States|Prohibition]]. When Prohibition was repealed, President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] asked the states not to permit the return of saloons.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nytimes.com/learning/general/onthisday/big/1205.html Prohibition Repeal is Ratified at 5:32 P.M.], New York Times, December 5, 1933&lt;/ref&gt;

Many Irish- or British-themed &quot;[[pub]]s&quot; exist throughout United States and Canada and in some continental European countries.

As of May, 2014, [[Pittsburgh]], [[Pennsylvania]] had the most bars [[per capita]] in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last =Ritenbaugh | first =Stephanie | title =In The Lead: Pittsburgh leads with the most bars per person  | newspaper =[[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]] | date =May 14, 2014  | url =http://www.post-gazette.com/in-the-lead-2014-stories/2014/05/14/Community-Pittsburgh-most-bars-per-capita-second-most-pizza/stories/201405150065 | accessdate = May 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:1bridesmaids crop.jpg|thumb|300px|Seven bridesmaids in matching dresses, with the bride]]

The '''bridesmaids''' are members of the bride's party in a wedding. A bridesmaid is typically a young woman, and often a close friend or sister.  She attends to the [[bride]] on the day of a [[wedding]] or [[marriage]] ceremony. Traditionally, bridesmaids were chosen from unwed young women of [[marriageable age]].

The principal bridesmaid, if one is so designated, may be called the '''chief bridesmaid''' or '''maid of honor''' if she is unmarried, or the '''matron of honor''' if she is married. A '''junior bridesmaid''' is a girl who is clearly too young to be married, but who is included as an honorary bridesmaid. In the United States, typically only the maid/matron of honor and the [[best man]] are the official witnesses for the [[wedding license]]. 

Often there is more than one bridesmaid: in modern times the bride chooses how many to ask. Historically, no person of status went out unattended, and the size of the retinue was closely calculated to be appropriate to the family's social status. A large group of bridesmaids provided an opportunity for showing off the family's social status and [[conspicuous consumption|wealth]]. Today, the number of bridesmaids in a wedding party is dependent on many variables, including a bride's preferences, the size of her family, and the number of attendants her partner would like to have as well.

The male equivalent is the [[groomsman]], also known in [[British English]] as an usher; in the United States, the role of attending to the groom has diverged from that of escorting guests to their seats, and the two positions are no longer synonymous and are often if not usually filled by different persons.

In some cultures, such as in [[Norway]] and [[Victorian England]], it has been customary for bridesmaids to be small girls rather than grown women. They may carry flowers during the wedding procession and pose with the married couple in bridal photos.  In modern English-speaking countries, this role is separate from that of the bridesmaid, and the small child performing it is known as a [[flower girl]].

==Duties==
[[File:Lehnga.jpg|thumb|right|Four bridesmaids wearing [[gagra choli]]s, the traditional dress of northern [[India]].]]
Although many exceed the minimum, the bridesmaids' required duties are very limited.&lt;ref name=&quot;isbn0-393-05874-3 pg 383&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Martin, Judith|authorlink=Judith Martin|others=Kamen, Gloria|title=Miss Manners' Guide to Excruciatingly Correct Behavior, Freshly Updated|publisher=W.

Bridesmaids in Europe and North America are often asked to assist the bride with planning the wedding and a [[wedding reception]]. In modern times, a bridesmaid often participates  in planning wedding-related events, such as a [[bridal shower]] or [[bachelorette party]], if there are any. These, however, are optional activities; according to etiquette expert [[Judith Martin]], &quot;Contrary to rumor, bridesmaids are not obliged to entertain in honor of the bride, nor to wear dresses they cannot afford.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;isbn0-609-60431-7&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Martin, Judith|title=Miss Manners on weddings|publisher=Crown Publishers|location=New York|year=1999|pages=136&amp;ndash;137|isbn=0-609-60431-7|oclc=|doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  If it is customary in the bride's area to have a bridesmaids luncheon, then it is hosted, and therefore organized and paid for, by the bride.&lt;ref name=&quot;1922 Post&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Post, Emily|authorlink=Emily Post|title=Etiquette in Society, in Business, in Politics and at Home'|publisher= Funk &amp; Wagnalls Company|year=1922|pages=335–337}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A junior bridesmaid has no responsibilities beyond attending the wedding.

The duties and costs of being a bridesmaid are parsed out between a bride and her attendants in a variety of ways. Since modern bridesmaids, unlike their historical counterparts, can no longer rely on having their clothes and travel expenses paid for by the bride's family, and are sometimes even told they must pay for parties that the bride wants to have before the wedding, it has become customary for the bride to present the bridesmaids with gifts as a sign of gratitude for the support and financial commitment that comes with their roles. It has become equally customary for women who are invited to serve as bridesmaids to first ask about the amount of time, energy, and money that the bride expects from them before accepting this position, and to decline or resign if this is more than they will be able to give.&lt;ref name=Steinberg&gt;{{cite news|last1=Steinberg|first1=Stephanie|title=How much does it cost to be a bridesmaid?|url=http://www.cnn.com/2011/LIVING/06/28/bridesmaids.cost/|publisher=CNN|date=28 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In some American weddings, each bridesmaid may be asked to spend US $1,700 or more, with travel to [[destination wedding]]s and pre-wedding parties usually being the biggest expense.&lt;ref name=Steinberg/&gt;

==Maid of honor {{Anchor|Matron of Honor}}==

{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2012}}
[[File:Bridesmaids1929.jpg|thumb|The bride (center) with her maid of honor (third from left) and bridesmaids.  The maid of honor can be distinguished by her dress, which differs somewhat from that of the other bridesmaids, as well as by her position in the traditional place of honor at the immediate right of the principal party.  From 1929, in [[Minnesota]], USA.]]
In the [[United Kingdom]], the term &quot;[[maid of honour]]&quot; originally referred to the female attendant of a [[queen regnant|queen]]. The term ''bridesmaid'' is normally used for all bridal attendants in the UK.  However, when the attendant is married, or is a mature woman, the term ''matron of honor'' is often used.  The influence of American English has led to the chief bridesmaid sometimes being called the maid of honor.  

In North America, a wedding party might include several bridesmaids, but the ''maid of honor'' is the title and position held by the bride's chief attendant, typically her closest friend or sister. In modern-day weddings some brides opt to choose a long-time male friend or brother as their head attendant, using the title ''best man'' or ''man of honor''.

The activities of the principal bridesmaid may be as many or as varied as she allows the bride to impose upon her. Her only required duty is to participate in the wedding ceremony. Typically, however, she is asked for help with the logistics of the wedding as an event, such as addressing [[Wedding invitation|invitations]], and for her help as a friend, such as attending the bride as she shops for her wedding dress.

On the day of the wedding, her principal duty is to provide practical and emotional support. She might assist the bride with dressing and, if needed, help the bride manage her veil, a bouquet, a prayer book, or the train of her wedding dress during the day. In a double-ring wedding, the chief bridesmaid is often entrusted with the groom's [[wedding ring]] until it is needed during the ceremony. Many brides ask bridesmaids, if they are [[age of majority|adults]], to be legal witnesses who sign the [[marriage license]] after the ceremony. If there is a reception after the wedding, the maid of honor may be asked to offer a toast to the newlywed.

==Origin and history==
The origin of the Western bridesmaid tradition is largely unknown, though it likely developed out of the need for witnesses to a wedding under civil law.{{fact|date=July 2015}}

Others cite the [[Hebrew Bible|Biblical]] story of [[Jacob]], and his two wives [[Leah]] and [[Rachel]], who both literally came with their own [[maid]]s as detailed in the [[Book of Genesis]] (29:24, 46:18) as the origin of bridesmaids.  These women were [[handmaiden]]s (servants or slaves) instead of social peers.

[[File:Bodysuit-drawn-wolford colorado.jpg|180px|thumb|A female version of the bodysuit]]

A '''bodysuit''' or shorthand '''body''' is a one-piece [[form-fitting garment]] that covers the torso and the [[crotch]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/bodysuit Merriam-webster dictionary]&lt;/ref&gt; The style of a basic bodysuit is similar to a [[one-piece swimsuit]] and a [[leotard]], though the materials may vary, and a bodysuit, unlike a swimsuit or leotard, has snaps, hooks or [[velcro]] at the crotch. A bodysuit may have sleeves and varying shoulder strap and collar styles. Bodysuits can be made from a number of fabrics, including [[cotton]], [[lace]], [[nylon]], etc. In general, textile bodysuits include expandable fiber such as [[spandex]] for a better fit to the shape of the body.

A bodysuit is normally worn with trousers or a [[skirt]]. The top, torso part may act as a top for the smooth line it gives or because it cannot become untucked from trousers or skirt. They may also be worn generally by women as [[underwear]], [[activewear]], or [[foundation garment]]s. Unlike a leotard, a bodysuit is not usually considered a form of athletic wear. [[Infant bodysuit|Onesie]]s (or snapsuits) are bodysuits for younger children, toddlers and some adults which help keep diapers (or nappies) in place. The purpose of the opening at the crotch is to facilitate access to a baby's diaper (or nappy), or for a visit to the toilet.

There are also bodyshirts, like the counterpart to the bodysuit, they are loose-fitting garments that cover the whole torso, with sleeves in short to long lengths and crotch snaps. The difference is that they look like a shirt on the top portion of the garment, and may have a different stretch fabric in the waist to the crotch area to make them fit better.

==History==
[[File:Candice-Swanepoel 2010-03-31 VictoriasSecretStoreChicago photo-by-Adam Bielawski.jpg|thumb|[[Victoria's Secret]] model wearing a bodysuit with a skirt, as it is encountered in everyday life.]]
The bodysuit was a progression from the leotard. It was presented in the United States after 1950 by fashion designer [[Claire McCardell]]. It was worn as a blouse or T-shirt. The first recognized bodysuit was worn by [[Bettie Page]] in the 1950s, and was a trademark attire of the [[Playboy Bunnies]] from the 1960s, as well as of [[Wonder Woman]] as a cartoon character.&lt;ref name=&quot;Obs&quot;&gt;[[Le Nouvel Observateur]]: {{cite article|language=fr|author=Philippe Azoury|title=Body sauvé des eaux|publisher=Obsession|issue=3| date=6 June 2012|pages=88-93|issn=0029-4713|accessdate=October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Azzedine Alaia]] and [[Donna Karan]] helped make the bodysuit a fashion item for both men and women in the 1980s. After a slowdown, it was resurrected as shaping underwear or lingerie, and in the 2010s it reappeared as a blouse bodysuit and classic turtleneck bodysuit, as well as a part of [[:wikt:evening dress|evening wear]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Safari-Jacket.JPG|250px|thumb|The &quot;Kalahari&quot; Safari Jacket by [[Beretta]].]]
A '''safari jacket''' or '''bush jacket''' is a garment originally designed for the purpose of going on [[safari]] in the [[Africa]]n bush. When paired with trousers or shorts, it becomes a '''safari suit'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/national/want-to-look-cool-get-a-safari-suit/2007/06/29/1182624171515.html|title=Want to look cool? Get a safari suit|publisher=[[The Age]]|first=Janice|last=Breen Burns|date=30 June 2007|accessdate=15 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; A safari jacket is commonly a lightweight [[cotton]] [[drill (fabric)|drill]] or lighter [[poplin]] jacket, traditionally [[khaki]] in color, with a self-belt, often with epaulette style shoulder straps called [[Shoulder strap#Shirt shoulder strap|passants]], with four or more expandable bellows pockets.

==History==
Lightweight, light-coloured uniforms were worn by European soldiers serving in warm climates from the 19th century and, little altered, throughout World War II.&lt;ref name=&quot;brayley&quot;&gt;[[Martin Brayley]], ''Armies of the Raj'', Osprey Publishing, 2012, page 36.&lt;/ref&gt; They typically featured epaulettes, pleated pockets, belts and other features later found on safari jackets.

The earliest reference to a 'safari suit' listed in the ''The Oxford English Dictionary''&lt;ref name=&quot;OED&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/169670|title=Safari|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|accessdate=23 July 2015}}{{Password-protected}}&lt;/ref&gt; is from an American newspaper in 1935. In 1936, author and adventurer [[Ernest Hemingway]] designed a 'bush jacket' which was made by [[Willis &amp; Geiger]]. In 1939, Abercrombie &amp; Fitch advertised safari jackets, shorts and trousers, of 'coat shirt style' for sports and leisure wear.&lt;ref name=&quot;larson&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archivalclothing.com/shopping-from-1939-abercrombie-and-fitch|title=Shopping from 1939: Abercrombie and Fitch|first=Lesli|last=Larson|date=10 November 2011|accessdate=23 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1960s and 70s safari suits became fashionable thanks to designers versions for men and women by, for example, French designers [[Ted Lapidus]] and [[Yves Saint Laurent (designer)|Yves Saint Laurent]], both of whom are among those credited with inventing and popularising the look.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.couriermail.com.au/lifestyle/fashion/safari-suit-designer-dies/story-e6frer4o-1111118436606|title=Safari suit designer Ted Lapidus dies, buried with Oscar Wilde|publisher=[[The Courier Mail]]|date=29 December 2008|accessdate=15 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Shaeffer|first=Claire B.|title=Couture sewing techniques|publisher=Taunton Press|location=Newtown, CT|isbn=9781600853357|page=110|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=fs9Iiw_zPZ0C&amp;pg=PA110#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|edition=Rev. and updated [ed.]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Australia==
The safari suit is popularly associated with Australian fashion in the 1970s when it was worn by the former [[Premier of South Australia|South Australian Premier]] [[Don Dunstan]].&lt;ref name=&quot;marks&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/australasia/the-turbulent-times-of-don-dunstan-a-revolutionary-in-hotpants-797146.html|title=The turbulent times of Don Dunstan, a revolutionary in hotpants|first=Kathy|last=Marks|publisher=[[The Independent]]|date=18 March 2008|accessdate=23 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==India==
In India, the safari suit gained popularity through the 1970s influenced to a large degree by films ([[James Bond]]/[[Roger Moore]]) and some fashions trends from the west for warmer climates. The safari suit in India gained prominence when local synthetic fibre manufacture and supply was significantly increased in the later half of the 70's.

[[Reliance Industries]] and other textile manufactures set up synthetic fibre plants in India significantly reducing the price of synthetic fibre and the Indian middle class jumped at the opportunity to be well dressed in a fabric which though unsuited to India's climate was fairly cheap, easy to maintain and long-lasting.&lt;ref name=&quot;subramanian&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thenational.ae/news/worldwide/south-asia/hail-the-safari-suit-vanished-symbol-of-modern-india|title=Hail the safari suit, vanished symbol of 'modern' India|publisher=[[The National (Abu Dhabi)|The National]]|first=Samanth|last=Subramanian|date=29 June 2011|accessdate=29 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The safari suit continued to be the de facto business attire, particularly in government/public sectors and the SMB arena in India, through the late 1990s. With India's growth over the 1990s, liberalization and with the middle class suddenly having more disposable income, the younger generations began to gravitate towards more modern western fashions such as suits and other business attire. Although it is still visible in some parts of India, the Safari suit is now indelibly associated with the so-called License Raj - the slow, inefficient Indian bureaucracy of the 1970s and the 1980s.

==In popular culture==
[[Roger Moore]]'s [[James Bond (character)|James Bond]] wore beige safari jackets or bush shirts with matching pants in ''[[The Man with the Golden Gun (film)|The Man with the Golden Gun]]'', ''[[Moonraker (film)|Moonraker]]'' and ''[[Octopussy]]''. The safari jacket was a favourite of [[J. R. Ewing]] in the 1980s evening soap opera ''[[Dallas (1978 TV series)|Dallas]]''&lt;ref name=&quot;dallasdecoder&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dallasdecoder.com/2012/04/09/dallas-styles-j-r-s-safari-shirts/|title=Dallas Styles: J.R.’s Safari Shirts|first=Chris|last=B|date=9 April 2009|accessdate=23 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; where he usually wore it with an [[Ascot tie|ascot]]. The Marvel Comics superhero [[Wonder Man]] wore a red safari jacket with black pants as his costume for a period of time. In the [[J.G. Ballard]] novel ''[[High Rise (novel)|High Rise]]'', the character Anthony Royal wears a white safari jacket.

'''Academic dress''' is a traditional form of [[clothing]] for [[academia|academic]] settings, primarily [[tertiary education|tertiary]] (and sometimes [[secondary schools|secondary]]) education, worn mainly by those who have been admitted to a [[university degree]] (or similar), or hold a status that entitles them to assume them (e.g., undergraduate students at certain old universities).&lt;ref&gt;Shaw (1995), p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; It is also known as '''academicals''' and, in the [[United States]], as '''academic regalia'''.

Contemporarily, it is commonly seen only at [[graduation]] ceremonies, but formerly academic dress was, and to a lesser degree in many [[ancient university|ancient universities]] still is, worn daily. Today the ensembles are distinctive in some way to each institution, and generally consists of a [[gown]] (also known as a [[robe]]) with a separate [[hood (headgear)|hood]], and usually a cap (generally either a [[square academic cap]], a [[tam (cap)|tam]], or a [[Tudor bonnet|bonnet]]). Academic dress is also worn by members of certain [[learned societies]] and institutions as official dress.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. [http://www.burgon.org.uk/society/robes.php Burgon Society: Robes]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.facs.org/archives/congresshighlight.html |title=History and Archives of the American College of Surgeons; Highlight of the Month October 10, 2005; The Clinical Congress: Then and Now, accessed 01/29/2008 |publisher=Facs.org |date= |accessdate=2010-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==
The academic dress found in most universities in the [[Commonwealth of Nations]] and the [[United States]] is derived from that of the universities of [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] and [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]], which was a development of academic and clerical dress common throughout the [[medieval university|medieval universities]] of [[Europe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.phildress.co.uk/london/origins.html |title=Goff, pp. 13–14 |publisher=Phildress.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2010-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!--, itself a development of the academic robes worn in the medieval [[Madrasah]]s of the [[Middle East]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A History of Christian-Muslim Relations|first=Hugh|last=Goddard|year=2000|publisher=[[Edinburgh University Press]]|isbn=074861009X|page=100|isbn status=May be invalid – please double check|postscript=None}}--&gt;

Formal or sober clothing is typically worn beneath the gown so, for example, men would often wear a dark [[suit (clothes)|suit]] with a white [[shirt]] and a [[Necktie|tie]], or [[clerical clothing]], [[military uniform|military]] or civil [[uniform]], or [[national dress]], and women would wear equivalent attire. Some older universities, particularly Oxford and Cambridge, have a prescribed set of dress (known as ''[[subfusc]]'') to be worn under the gown. Though some universities are relaxed about what people wear under their gowns, it is nevertheless considered bad form to be in [[casual wear]] or the like during graduation ceremonies, and a number of universities may bar finishing students from joining the procession or the ceremony itself if not appropriately dressed&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=n.wood@sheffield.ac.uk |url=http://www.shef.ac.uk/eventsteam/wear.html |title=University of Sheffield: What should I wear? |publisher=Shef.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=2010-04-28| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100405090210/http://www.shef.ac.uk/eventsteam/wear.html| archivedate= 5 April 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; (though this sometimes refers only to requiring the proper wear of academic dress and not what is worn beneath it, if unseen).  In the Commonwealth, gowns are worn open, while in the United States it has become common for gowns to close at the front, as did the original ''roba''.

==Materials==
In general, the materials used for academic dress are heavily influenced by the climate where the academic institution is located, or the climate where the graduate will usually be wearing the costume (as a faculty member at another institution, for example).  In either case, the American Council of Education (ACE) allows for the comfort of the wearer, and concedes that lighter materials be used in tropical climates, and heavier materials elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;Sullivan. The Academic Costume Code, Gowns, ''Material''&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, it acknowledges cotton poplin, broadcloth, rayon, or silk as appropriate.&lt;ref&gt;Sullivan. The Academic Costume Code, Caps, ''Material''&lt;/ref&gt;

The materials used for academic dress vary and range from the extremely economical to the very expensive. In the United States, most Bachelor and master's degree candidates are often only presented the &quot;[[souvenir]]&quot; version of regalia by their institutions or authorized vendor, which are generally intended for very few wearings and are comparatively very inexpensive.  For some doctoral graduates commencement will be the only time they wear academic regalia, and so they rent their gowns instead of buying them. These rented (or hired)&lt;ref&gt;American English uses 'rented', British English uses 'hired'.&lt;/ref&gt; gowns are often made of inexpensive [[polyester]] or other man-made synthetic fibre. In Britain, rented gowns are almost always polyester while Russell cord, silk or artificial silk gowns are only available when bought. Undergraduate gowns are usually made from cotton or cotton and polyester mix and are relatively inexpensive to encourage students to own them.

People who choose to buy their dress may opt for finer fabrics, such as [[poplin]], [[grosgrain]], [[Percale]], [[cotton]], [[wool]], [[cassimere]], [[broadcloth]], [[Russell cord]] or corded/ribbed material. For silk, there are a range of types including [[artificial silk]]/[[rayon]], [[Ottoman (textile)|Ottoman]] (i.e. ribbed or corded silk), [[taffeta]], [[satin]], [[alpaca]], true [[silk]], [[shot silk]] or a mixture. Pure Ottoman silk is rarely used except for official gowns as it is very expensive.&lt;ref&gt;An [[Ede &amp; Ravenscroft]] [[Oxford MA]] hood made of pure Ottoman silk will cost around £347. Source: http://www.gownhire.co.uk (21 September 2007)&lt;/ref&gt; Some gowns may be trimmed with [[gimp (lace)|gimp]] [[lace]], cords, buttons or other forms of decoration.

In the past, [[fur]] has been used to line certain hoods (especially those of the UK) which range from [[rabbit fur|rabbit]] to [[ermine]]. In the past, [[sheepskin]] was widely used. Most now use imitation fur instead, mainly because of cost and [[animal rights]] concerns. Some robemakers will use fur if the customer requests and pays for it, as some feel that the quality and feel of artificial fur has yet to match that of real fur.&lt;ref&gt;The cost difference between artificial and real fur can be as much as a few hundred pounds.&lt;/ref&gt;

Doctor's robes usually use wool [[flannel]], [[panama (wool)|panama]] (worsted), superfine cloth, [[damask]] or [[brocade]] and are brightly coloured (or black, but faced with a bright colour) to distinguish them from lower degrees. They tend to be the most expensive because they must be dyed in a specific colour and/or be trimmed in coloured silks. Many doctoral gowns have a special undress version so adding to the cost of a full set.

A full set may cost about $360 (£180) for cheap materials to as much as $5800 (£2900) for high quality materials.&lt;ref&gt;Ede &amp; Ravenscroft: [[Academic dress of Oxford University#Doctors of Music|Oxford DMus]] undress and full dress academic dress costs £2910 (undress gown: £181, hood: £409, rigid mortarboard: £80, full dress gown: £2117, velvet bonnet: £123). Information retrieved 18 May 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Usually, ex-hire gowns are available for purchase at cheaper prices though the quality may be lower.&lt;ref&gt;Hired hoods are usually partially lined instead of fully lined when the regulations specify a fully lined hood. However, there are some cases where a hood that is specified as fully lined in the regulations, in practice, is part-lined to save on materials. This is especially the case for Glasgow full-shape hoods [f9] as they are large and most of the lining may not be seen when worn.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Academic dress by country==

===Canada===
[[File:Academic regalia.jpg|thumb|left|Ceremonial robe of [[McGill University]]'s Principal and chief executive.]]

[[File:Scarlet 3.JPG|thumb|right|[[McGill University]]'s [[scarlet (color)|scarlet]], [[Ph.D.]] regalia dates back to the early 19th century.]]

In [[Canada]], academic regalia is worn by university officials, faculty, students and honored guests during [[Graduation|commencement]] exercises, installations of their presiding officers and special convocations, such as the inauguration of newly endowed professorial chairs and inductions to some of the honor and professional societies with university chapters.  Academic regalia typically consists of a headgear ([[mortarboard]], [[Tudor bonnet]] or [[John Knox cap]]), robe and hood.  Until the 1930s, Canadian universities customarily prescribed academic robes for its professors and students at classes and lectures.  At the University of Trinity College at the University of Toronto academic gowns are still required for all students and faculty at weekday dinners, most college meetings, debates and certain special college events.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.trinity.utoronto.ca/student-services/other-services/gowns.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Most Canadian universities follow or adopted either the British University academic dress at [[Oxford]] or [[Cambridge]] universities,&lt;ref&gt;Gibson, William (2004). The Regulation of Undergraduate Dress at Oxford and Cambridge, 1660–1832. '''Burgon Society Annual'''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hargreaves-Mawdsley, W.N. (1963). '''A History of Academical Dress in Europe until the End of the Eighteenth Century'''. Oxford: Clarendon Press.&lt;/ref&gt;  or the Intercollegiate Code of Academic Costume ratified by most American universities in the late 1890s.&lt;ref&gt;Armagost, Robert (2009).  University Uniforms: The Standardization of Academic Dress in the United States. '''Transactions of the Burgon Society''', 9, p. 140.&lt;/ref&gt;  Other universities contain elements of the British and American patterns for some or all of their academic costumes.  A classic example is the [[academic dress of McGill University]], whose British origins are evident in the regalia of its degree holders.  The distinctive ceremonial regalia of [[McGill University]] officials, on the other hand, is closer to the American pattern for the master's robe with above the elbow, square slit-cut sleeves.  The scarlet, Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) regalia of McGill can now be worn closed-front, unlike the open-front only gown of the [[University of Cambridge]] higher doctorate full dress, from which it evolved.  Gold strand tassels used in American doctoral regalia are wrapped around McGill's otherwise Tudor-style bonnet or tam.

===France===
[[File:Docteurs-SorbonneUniversités-13.jpg|thumbnail|Doctors of various faculties, Paris]]
In [[France]], academic dress, also called the ''toge'' (from the word [[toga]], an ancient Roman garment), is similar to French judges' court dress, except for its colour, which depends on the academic field in which the wearer graduated. It is nowadays little worn, except by doctors during the opening of the university year or the ceremony for a doctorate ''[[honoris causa]]''. For doctors, it consists of:
* a long gown (a bit similar to a cassock) with a long row of buttons (traditionally, 33, but nowadays usually fewer) in front and a train at the back (which in the current costume is not visible but attached with a button in the inner side of the gown). The gown is in two colours: black and the standard colour of the academic field in which the wearer graduated (see below), with simarras (two vertical bands in the front of the gown).
* an ''épitoge'' (epitoga): a piece of cloth with white fur stripes (three for doctors) attached by a button on the left shoulder, with a rectangular, long, thin tail in the front and a triangular, shorter, broad tail in the back (both tails carry the fur stripes); its colour is that of the relevant academic field. The epitoga has evolved from the academic hood, which explains why the French academic dress does not include a hood.
* a long, wide belt or sash, either black or of the colour of the relevant academic field, ended by fringes (which may be golden or of the same colour as the belt), and attached with a broad ornamental knot.
* a white ''rabat'' ([[jabot (neckwear)|jabot]]), over which a white tie may be worn for ceremonial occasions. It is made of lace for the Dean of the Faculty, the President of the University, and a few other officials; of plain cotton for others.
* only for men, a mortarboard of the colour of the relevant academic field with a golden stripe, which is usually not worn but carried (since anyway the academic dress in France is rarely worn outdoors, and men are supposed not to wear hats indoors), and often even omitted.
* in principle white bow tie and white gloves.

Professors who served 20 years are sometimes presented with a sword (identical model to that of French Police commissars).

The colours of the various academic fields are daffodil (yellow) for literature and arts, amaranth (purplish red) for science, redcurrant (reddish pink) for medicine, scarlet red for law, and violet (purple) for theology. University rectors, chancellors or presidents wear also specific costumes, which are violet regardless of the academic field in which they graduated.

The dress exists in two versions: the ''petit costume'' (&quot;small costume&quot;) and the ''grand costume'' (&quot;great costume&quot;). Both are identical in form, and differ only in the presence or absence of the mortarboard and the repartition of colours on the gown and sash (the other elements of the dress, especially the epitoga, being identical for both):
* for the ''petit costume'', the gown is all black, except the simarras which are of the colour of the academic field; the buttons are black; the sash and its fringes moiré black; the mortarboard is usually not worn;
* for the ''grand costume'', the gown is black between the simarras, which are moiré black, and of the colour of the academic field on the sides and on the sleeves, except their turn-ups, which are black; the buttons are of the colour of the academic field; the sash is of the colour of the academic field, its fringes may be either the same colour or gold.

In formal occasions, the ''grand costume'' is equivalent to [[white tie]], whereas the ''petit costume'' is equivalent to [[black tie]].

The German academic dress is called &quot;Talar&quot; (with the accent on the second &quot;a&quot;: talár; from Latin ''talare'' which means ''to the ankles''), and can be described as the normal black long gown with wide sleeves common to all scholars in Europe and America. It can be traced back to the every day clothes of the scholars in the Middle Ages. The same word ''Talar'' is also used for the robes of Protestant (Lutheran) pastors and rabbis (not for judges or lawyers, their gowns are called &quot;Robe&quot;), although these gowns often differ more or less in cut, length, drappings, and sometimes even in colour (the gowns of the [[Federal Constitutional Court of Germany|German Supreme Court]] are, e.g., completely dark red).

In Germany only the rectors, deans, professors, and lecturers wore the gowns—not students or graduates. Each German university had its own system of colours and drapings, which differs from that of British and American universities (for example, theology is normally not bright red but dark purple, similar to the French system). After the [[German student movement]] following the years of 1967, all German universities dropped their academic dress because they were identified with right-winged conservatism and reactionism by the mostly socialist influenced students at that time: The famous slogan &quot;Unter den Talaren – Muff von 1000 Jahren&quot; (''beneath the gowns the [[:wikt:fug|fug]] of 1000 years'') refers not only to the old traditions of the Middle Ages, but also to the Nazi regime and their self-declared &quot;empire of 1000 years&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spiegel.de/unispiegel/wunderbar/0,1518,grossbild-162447-364924,00.html |title=Famous photo of students in 1967 revolting in Hamburg in front of fully dressed scholars |publisher=Spiegel.de |date=13 July 2005 |accessdate=2010-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was not until recently that some universities started to use their traditional academic dress again. For example, the University of Bonn re-adopted academic dress in 2005 for the first time since 1969.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spiegel.de/unispiegel/wunderbar/0,1518,364924,00.html |title=2005: First use of gowns in Bonn since 1969 |publisher=Spiegel.de |date=13 July 2005 |accessdate=2010-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today many young and newly founded universities also use academic dress, not to revive old traditions but to follow Anglo-American examples.

===Italy===

[[File:Luigi Einaudi Plinio Fraccaro.jpg|right|thumb|250px|The Magnificus [[Rector (academia)|Rector]] of the [[Pavia]] University [[Plinio Fraccaro]], wearing gown and academic cap, welcomes the [[President of Italy|President of Republic]] [[Luigi Einaudi]], 13 April 1955]]
In [[Italy]] there are several differences among the typical academic dress ([[gowns]], [[academic cap]]s, etc.) of the different universities, due to the great number of ancient universities in the country (for example the [[University of Bologna]],&lt;ref&gt;http://people.ciram.unibo.it/~ruggeri/inaugurazione1.JPG&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://bologna.repubblica.it/images/2010/12/17/123141060-65907856-b255-4cd7-aa52-c8c7a8309c5d.jpg&lt;/ref&gt; [[University of Pavia]],&lt;ref&gt;http://milano.corriere.it/vivimilano/media/foto/2006/07_Luglio/03/corteo2.jpg&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www-5.unipv.it/alumni/images/GIORNATAdelLAUREATO_banner.jpg&lt;/ref&gt; [[University of Padua]],&lt;ref name=&quot;giuri.unipd.it&quot;&gt;http://www.giuri.unipd.it/~dottorato/S011E1EEF.2/RS2672_IMG_75321.jpg&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.provincia.pd.it/uploads/images/ufficio-stampa/PAG%20INTERNE/DSCN_0592.jpg&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.unipd.it/ilbo/sites/unipd.it.ilbo/files/imagecache/gallery_big/aa_media1.jpg&lt;/ref&gt; [[University of Pisa]],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.unipi.it/ateneo/comunica/cerimonie/inaugura/anno_accademico2003.htm_asc001.jpg&lt;/ref&gt; [[University of Siena]],&lt;ref&gt;http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8364/8269201093_b8f863d3c8_h.jpg&lt;/ref&gt; [[University of Florence]],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lanazione.it/data/images/gallery/2012/46488/21.JPG&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sapienza University of Rome|University of Rome]],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.panorama.it/images/foto/sapienza-rettore-4500-docenti-una-forza-se-stiamo-insieme/548495-1/SAPIENZA-RETTORE-4500-DOCENTI-UNA-FORZA-SE-STIAMO-INSIEME_h_partb.jpg&lt;/ref&gt; etc.). Usually gowns are worn only by professors during ceremonies and, in some faculties, during graduations. After the [[Protests of 1968|student protests of 1968]] many professors in many universities had stopped wearing academical gowns also in the formal occasions but since the [[nineties]] people have started to use them again, mostly in [[humanities|humanities faculties]].&lt;ref&gt;http://archiviostorico.corriere.it/1996/aprile/05/Lauree_all_antica_torna_alla_co_0_9604052394.shtml&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;bolognatoday.it&quot;&gt;http://www.bolognatoday.it/cronaca/universita-bologna-lauree-piazza-toga.html&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, also students have started to wear gowns and cap in graduation ceremonies (usually for Ph.D.) in some universities.&lt;ref name=&quot;giuri.unipd.it&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;bolognatoday.it&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.viasarfatti25.unibocconi.it/stampa.php?idArt=3082&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://piacenza.unicatt.it/eventi/festa-di-laurea-2012-12520&lt;/ref&gt; Gowns are traditionally all hemmed with the colours of faculty, which have some variations following the tradition of each atheneum.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.unisinforma.net/w2d3/v3/view/unisinforma/news/notizie--3659/index.html&lt;/ref&gt; However the most widely used table of coulours is the following&lt;ref&gt;http://comefare.com/come-scegliere-i-colori-giusti-per-la-laurea/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Malaysia===
In Malaysia, most public university academic gowns incorporate [[Songket]] motifs.

===New Zealand===
University graduates in New Zealand wear an academic gown identical to those of the [[University of Cambridge]]&lt;ref name=&quot;auckland.ac.nz&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.auckland.ac.nz/uoa/cs-what-to-wear-to-graduation#s2c4 |title=What to wear to graduation - The University of Auckland |publisher=Auckland.ac.nz |date= |accessdate=2013-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; and either a hood or scarf, depending on whether the graduate is receiving a degree or diploma. If the graduate is receiving a degree, a hood&lt;ref name=&quot;auckland.ac.nz&quot;/&gt; will be worn throughout the ceremony. If a diploma is received, the graduate will wear a diploma scarf.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.auckland.ac.nz/uoa/cs-what-to-wear-to-graduation#s2c5 |title=What to wear to graduation - The University of Auckland |publisher=Auckland.ac.nz |date= |accessdate=2013-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The hood, like the gown, is identical to that of the hood for the Cambridge Master of Arts. A Bachelor's degree hood is lined with coloured satin and bordered with white fur (the exception to this are Canterbury and Waikato University which do not line their hoods with fur). The bachelor's degree with Honours hood is lined with coloured satin and bordered with white satin. The master's degree hood has no edging. A Doctoral Degree recipient wears the same as a graduate receiving a Masters, except the gown is completely silk, either black or scarlet, with the option to wear a cloth gown. A Doctoral hood is completely silk and the headdress is a black Tudor bonnet, in place of the flat-topped mortarboard worn with Bachelor's and Master's gowns .

Academic dress is rarely worn in New Zealand other than for some rare academic events.

Below is a list of the general hood colours of graduates:

===Philippines===
Most colleges and universities in the Philippines follows the traditional [[mortarboard]], hood and gown during graduation.

In some schools of the country, the colour of the gown corresponds to the school colour (Blue for [[Colegio de San Juan de Letran]] and [[Ateneo de Manila University]], Green for [[Far Eastern University]], and Red for [[San Beda College]]).

Some schools like the [[University of Santo Tomas]], due to its Spanish heritage, follows the Spanish academic attire such as the [[Biretta#Academic biretta|academic biretta]] and [[mozetta]]. The birreta and mozetta are worn by those from the Graduate School and the Faculty of Medicine and Surgery. Graduates of the Bachelors' programs wear the traditional mortarboard, hood and gown. The professors of the University wear their academic regalia during the Missa de Apertura or the Opening Mass of the Academic Year aside from Solemn Investitures (graduation ceremonies) and other academic activities.  The academic colours are unique to this university as these depend on the official color of the faculty or college a student or an academe belongs into.

A unique graduation garb by the [[University of the Philippines]] is the use of the ''Sablay''. The ''Sablay'' was inspired from the Malong of Muslim Mindanao thus, giving it a Filipiniana look. It features the indigenous [[baybayin]] characters for &quot;U&quot; and &quot;P&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ovcrd.upd.edu.ph/?p=761|title= UP Sablay|accessdate=2010-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the commencement ceremony, graduates wear the ''Sablay'' at the right shoulder, it is then moved to the left shoulder after the President of the University confers their degree, &quot;similar to the moving of the tassel of the academic cap.&quot; The ''Sablay'' is worn over traditional Filipino attire – [[Barong Tagalog]] for men and Filipiniana dress for women.

Elementary and high school students also wear a certain kind of academic dress upon their graduation, usually a white gown and mortarboard for public schools. For private schools, the gown and mortarboard's color is at the discretion of the administration. There are several schools which make use of a hood-like design on top of their gowns which bears the school colors.

In most Portuguese universities and other types of higher education institutions, usage of academic dress for undergraduates, or ''traje académico'' is still widespread and has even gained popularity in recent decades.{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}} The ''traje'' is composed of black trousers (or skirt, for female students), white shirt, black tie, a black overcoat, known as ''batina'' (in the case of male students, the classical ''traje'' also includes a black vest) and a black robe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.protocolo.org/gest_web/proto_Seccion.pl?rfID=279&amp;arefid=252 |title=El traje académico.

July 17, 2008 (accessed) |language=es |publisher=Protocolo.org |date=21 December 2009 |accessdate=2010-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some Portuguese higher education institutions have their typical academic outfit which differs greatly from that born in the ancient [[University of Coimbra]]. This is the case, for example, of those worn by the students of the [[University of the Algarve]] and [[Minho University]]. Usage is generally restricted to the first weeks of the semester, during the introductory and reception activities which make part of the [[Praxe]] tradition. In some older institutions, where traditions are better implemented, one can see students ''trajados'' during the entire year, though.

''This article is partially translated from [[:es:Indumentaria académica]]''

[[File:HonoriscausaValladolid.jpg|left|300px|thumb|''[[Honoris causa]]'' doctorates wearing the Spanish doctor's academic dress for Sciences at the [[University of Valladolid]], [[Spain]].]]
[[File:rector univ.jpg|left|180px|thumb|Spanish ''rector'' (University president) in full academic dress, wearing the hexagonal ''birrete'' ([[biretta]]) that is the [[academic cap]] in Spanish universities.]]

The typical Spanish academic dress has Latin origin. It has been regulated since 1850, when Queen Isabella II established several rules about academic dress, according to the centuries-old Spanish custom. The typical Spanish academic dress for doctors is composed by:
* A black long gown (''toga'') with a long row of buttons, made of satin and wool. It is worn over a black suit.
* A [[mozzetta]] (''muceta''), whose colour depends on the academic field.
* Long embroidered cuffs (''puñetas''). They are usually made of white cotton, although those of the ''Rector'' (University president) are red or pink. The buttons are made of gold for the Rector and made of silver for the Deans.
* A hexagonal [[biretta]] (''birrete''), whose colour depends on the academic field.
* White gloves.
* A ring is usually worn by doctors.
* A staff or scepter (''bastón'') made of American reed is carried by the University rector.
* Medallions are often worn by postgraduates, doctors, professors, deans and the University rector.

However, this academic dress is only used for the opening of the academic year and for PhD graduations or for doctorates ''[[honoris causa]]''. It is worn only by doctors, deans and the University Rector. For other graduates, the academic dress is often composed by a [[mortarboard]] and a mozzetta (''muceta'') or a sash over the shoulder (''beca'') with the shield of the University and/or Faculty. The colour of the mozzetta or the sash depends on the academic field.

The colours used in Spain for the various academic fields are:

===Sri Lanka===
In Sri Lanka, the academic dress consists of gown, a garland or hood. Universities that were affiliated to the former [[University of Ceylon]] issue black gowns for graduates and post graduates; red gowns for masters and Phd graduates; crimson gowns for chancellors with a different colour gowns for senior academic faculty. These universities issue [[garland]] to all academics and only issue mortar boards to chancellor, vice chancellor and registrars. Modern universities issue mortar boards to graduates along with a hood in place of garland.

===Sweden and Finland===
[[File:TFteknolog.jpg|thumb|right|A traditional Finnish technology student's hat from the [[Helsinki University of Technology]]. (photograph taken on top of a mirror)]]
[[File:Finnish doctoral hat.JPG|thumb|right|Finnish doctoral hat for a doctor of science from the [[University of Oulu]].]]

Finland and Sweden have similar traditions when it comes to academic clothing. For important academic ceremonies [[white tie]] is usually worn, however, often with traditional headwear and gowns.

In Finland and Sweden technology students wear a special kind of cap called a ''teekkarilakki'' (Finnish) or ''teknologmössa'' (Swedish). It is similar to the traditional ''studentmössa'' cap worn by all high-school graduates in both countries, but features a tuft and a distinctive [[cockade]] to show which university the wearer is attending. Technology students generally wear their caps more frequently, and thus the tuft often symbolizes university-engineers. Although universities have different rules regarding the use of the cap, it is generally not awarded to the student until he or she has completed the first year of their studies. The technology student's hat may also be seen on informal occasions, being worn with the  [[student overall]] at many universities.

In both countries many universities have doctoral hats for persons who have completed a PhD or similar degree. These usually resemble [[top hats]]. At some universities, a [[doctoral ring]] is awarded together with the hat. In the [[Ingmar Bergman]] film ''[[Wild Strawberries (film)|Wild Strawberries]]'', one scene shows the conferral of a Jubilee doctor degree on the main character at the [[University of Lund]], which includes the presentation of such a hat and ring. At the [[University of Helsinki]] a cape and a sword are commonly worn with the doctoral hat. Students of the student organization &quot;Limes&quot; may also be seen wearing a black cape.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.limes.fi/fi/jarjesto/tiedostot/cat_view/41-viralliset-asiat.html |title=Tiedostot &amp;#124; Viralliset asiat |publisher=Limes.fi |date= |accessdate=2010-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Thailand===
Academic dress used by universities in Thailand follow two traditions. Some universities use a traditional robe known as ''[[suea khrui]]'', while others follow Western styles.

===Tunisia===
In [[Tunisia]], [[University of Ez-Zitouna]] graduates wear an academic gown. Doctoral graduates in Islamic Sciences wear a jebba.
For other Tunisian universities, there is no academic gown.

There is a distinction between different types of academical dress. Most recently, gowns, hoods and caps are categorised into their shape and patterns by the [[Groves classification system]], which is based on [[Nicholas Groves]]'s document, ''Hood and Gown Patterns''.&lt;ref&gt;The Burgon Society: [http://www.burgon.org.uk/design/groves.php The Design of Academical Dress] (6 May 2007) Classification of Styles&lt;/ref&gt; This lists the various styles or patterns of academic dress and assigns them a code or a [[Groves Classification Number]]. For example, the Cambridge BA style gown is designated [b2] and a hood in the Cambridge full-shape is designated [f1], etc. Because the universities are free to design their own academicals using a wide range of available gown, hood and cap patterns, colours and materials at their and the robemaker's disposal, the academicals of two given universities rarely clash with each other.

The [[Burgon Society]] was founded in 2000 to promote the study of academic dress.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.burgon.org.uk/society/index.php Burgon Society: Introduction] (2 November 2008)&lt;/ref&gt; Its publications and activities examine the history and current use of academic dress and in 2011 it published the third edition of Shaw's reference book on British and Irish academical dress.&lt;ref&gt;Groves, Nicholas. &quot;Shaw's Academical Dress of Great Britain and Ireland&quot;, London: Burgon Society, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The Society hosts a conference each spring at which recent research is presented.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Meeting of the Burgon Society.&quot; http://www.burgon.org.uk/society/meetings.php&lt;/ref&gt;

The modern gown is derived from the ''roba'' worn under the ''cappa clausa'', a garment resembling a long black cape. In early medieval times, all students at the universities were in at least [[minor orders]], and were required to wear the ''cappa'' or other clerical dress, and restricted to clothes of black or other dark colour.  The gowns most commonly worn, that of the clerical type gowns of [[Bachelor of Arts]] (BA) and [[Master of Arts]] (MA), are substantially the same throughout the English-speaking world. Both are traditionally made of black cloth, (although occasionally the gown is dyed in one of the university's colours) and have the material at the back of the gown gathered into a yoke. The BA gown has bell-shaped sleeves, while the MA gown has long sleeves closed at the end, with the arm passing through a slit above the elbow.&lt;ref name=&quot;Shaw4-7&quot;&gt;Shaw (1995); pp. 4–7&lt;/ref&gt;

There are two distinctive shapes used in the UK for doctor's gown; the Oxford doctor's shape and the Cambridge doctor's shape. The former has bell-shaped sleeves, the latter has long open sleeves. Another rarer form is the Cambridge MusD dress gown which is a pattern between the two.  The other form of doctor's gown is the undress gown. This is a black gown worn for less formal occasions such as lectures. This type of gown is rarely seen or worn nowadays as many wear the dress gown instead; however, the undress gown still plays a part in the older universities where academic dress is usually worn.

Undergraduates at many older universities also wear gowns;&lt;ref&gt;Hargreaves-Mawdsley, pp. 91–101, 128–135, 146, 148–149&lt;/ref&gt; the most common essentially a smaller knee-length version of the BA gown, or the Oxford Commoners gown which is sleeveless lay type gown and has two streamers at the back at Oxford.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shepherdandwoodward.co.uk/acatalog/Oxford_University_Student_Gowns.html |title=Shepherd &amp; Woodward: Oxford University student gowns |publisher=Shepherdandwoodward.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2010-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; At Cambridge, most colleges have their own distinctive design of gown.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.srcf.ucam.org/cucags/spotter.htm |title=CU Cap &amp; Gown Society: Gown-spotter's guide |publisher=Srcf.ucam.org |date= |accessdate=2010-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Undergraduates at St Andrews, with the exception of theology students, commonly wear scarlet woollen gowns with velvet collars.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/capod/staff/resourcesfornewstaff/universityintroduction/studentsatstandrews/universityofstandrewstraditions/traditionalredgowns/&lt;/ref&gt; Undergraduate gowns are seldom worn (even in institutions that prescribe them) nowadays except in the older universities.

Another form of dress, now rarely seen, is the habit, which is worn over a black gown. Only Oxford, Cambridge, Durham and Newcastle use habits and mainly reserve their use for very formal ceremonial occasions and to a specific group of academics or officials.

The hood was originally a functional garment, worn to shield the head from the elements. In the English tradition, it has developed to an often bright and decorative garment worn only on special occasions.  Hoods comprise two basic patterns: full shape or simple shape. The traditional full-shape hood consists of a cape, [[cowl]], and [[liripipe]], as is used at Cambridge. At Oxford, the bachelors' and masters' hoods use simple hoods that have lost their cape and retain only the cowl and liripipe.&lt;ref&gt;''Burgon Annual 2003'' (2004); pp. 18–23&lt;/ref&gt;  The colour and [[lining (sewing)|lining]] of hoods in academic dress represents the rank and/or faculty of the wearer.&lt;ref&gt;Groves (2008), ''Hood Key''&lt;/ref&gt; In many Commonwealth universities bachelors wear hoods edged or lined with white rabbit fur, while masters wear hoods lined with coloured silk (originally ermine or other expensive fur). Doctors' hoods are normally made of scarlet cloth and lined with coloured silk.&lt;ref&gt;Shaw (1995); p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; Faculty colours were introduced by the University of London and many universities followed suit.&lt;ref&gt;''Burgon Transactions'' vol. 5 (2006); pp. 80–89&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[academic cap]] or square, commonly known as the mortarboard, has come to be symbolic of academia. In some universities it can be worn by graduates and undergraduates alike. It is a flat square hat with a tassel suspended from a button in the top centre of the board.  The mortarboard may also be referred to as a [[trencher cap]] (or simply trencher). The [[tassel]] comprises a cluster of silk threads which are fixed together and fastened by a button at one end, and fixed at the centre of the headpiece. The loose strands are allowed to fall freely over the board edge, typically falling over the left front side of the cap. Often the strands are [[Braid|plaited]] together to form a cord with the end threads left untied.  In many universities, holders of doctorates wear a soft-crowned, round-brimmed headpiece known as a [[Tudor bonnet]] or [[tam (cap)|tam]], rather than a trencher. Other types of hats used, especially in some universities in the UK, are the [[John Knox cap]] (mostly at Scottish universities), the [[Bishop Andrewes cap]] (a reinvention of the ancient form of the mortarboard, worn by Cambridge [[Doctor of Divinity|DDs]]) and the [[Pileus (hat)#University of Sussex pileus|pileus]] (at Sussex). In some universities, such as Oxford, women may wear an Oxford ladies' cap.&lt;ref&gt;Goff; pp.22–23&lt;/ref&gt;

Officers of the universities generally wear distinctive and more elaborate dress. The [[Chancellor (education)|Chancellor]] and the [[Vice-Chancellor]] may wear a black damask lay type gown (sometimes with a long train) trimmed with gold or silver [[lace]] and [[frog (fastening)|frogs]]. They wear a velvet mortarboard, similarly trimmed with gold braid and tassel.  Other than this gown, they may have other distinct forms of dress, such as the scarlet ''cappa clausa'' or [[cope]] worn in certain circumstances by the Vice-Chancellor of Cambridge or his/her deputy and by higher doctors presenting candidates for degrees, which was once worn by [[Doctor of Divinity|Doctors of Divinity]].&lt;ref&gt;Shaw (1966); pp. 94–95&lt;/ref&gt; In the past, Chancellors may also wear full court dress with breeches and court shoes like that of the [[Lord Chancellor]] of Great Britain.

At degree ceremonies, graduands often dress in the academic dress of the degree they are about to be admitted to prior to the actual graduation ceremony. This is not the case at several of the older universities in the UK, most notably, Oxford, Cambridge and St Andrews which have their own distinct traditions.

Academic regalia in the United States has been influenced by the academic dress traditions of Europe. There is an Inter-Collegiate code which sets out a detailed uniform scheme of academic regalia followed by most, though some institutions do not adhere to it entirely, and fewer still ignore it.

The practice of wearing academic regalia in the United States dates to the [[Colonial Colleges]] period, and was heavily influenced by European practices and styles.&lt;ref name=overview&gt;Sullivan.  The Academic Costume Code, ''Historical Overview''&lt;/ref&gt;  Students of most colonial colleges were required to wear the &quot;college habit&quot; at most times – a practice that lasted until the eve of the [[American Civil War]] in many institutions of higher learning.&lt;ref name=RegaliaOfPrinceton&gt;Smagorinsky. ''The REGALIA of Princeton University: Pomp, Circumstance, and Accountrements of Academia''. Page 5.&lt;/ref&gt; In some rare instances the practice has persisted, such as at [[Sewanee: The University of the South|Sewanee]], where members of one student society continue to wear the gown to class.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sewanee.edu/og/about |title=About – The Order of Gownsmen – Sewanee :: The University of the South |publisher=Sewanee.edu |date= |accessdate=2010-04-28| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100529201410/http://www.sewanee.edu/og/about| archivedate= 29 May 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;  After the Civil War, academic regalia was generally only worn at ceremonies or when representing the institution.&lt;ref name=RegaliaOfPrinceton /&gt;  There was not, however, any standardization among the meanings behind the various costumes.  In 1893, an Intercollegiate Commission made up of representatives from leading institutions was created, to establish an acceptable system of academic dress.  The Commission met at Columbia College (now [[Columbia University]]) in 1895 and adopted a code of academic regalia, which prescribed the cut and style and materials of the gowns, as well as determined the colours which were to represent the different fields of learning.&lt;ref&gt;New York Times. &quot;Gowns for College Men; Academic Costumes in American Universities (1896):
Plan to Secure a Uniform Practice in the Use of the Caps and Gowns in This Country So that the Degree of the Wearer, the Faculty Under Whom It Was Obtained, and the Institution Conferring It May Be Readily Seen.&quot;  Sunday, 26 April 1896.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1932 the [[American Council on Education]] (ACE) authorized the appointment of a committee 
{{quote|to determine whether revision and completion of the academic code adopted by the conference of the colleges and universities in 1895 is desirable at this time, and, if so, to draft a revised code and present a plan for submitting the code to the consideration of the institutional members of the Council.}}

The committee reviewed the situation and approved a code for academic costumes that has been in effect since that year. A ''Committee on Academic Costumes and Ceremonies'', appointed by the American Council on Education in 1959, again reviewed the academic dress code and made several changes.&lt;ref name=overview /&gt;

Although academic dress is now rarely worn outside [[Graduation|commencement]] ceremonies or other academic rituals such as [[encaenia]] in the U.S. graduation ceremonies have gained popularity and have expanded from high school graduations to middle school, elementary school and kindergarten graduation ceremonies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rhymeuniversity.com |title=Kindergarten graduation in the United States |publisher=Rhymeuniversity.com |date= |accessdate=2010-04-28| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100510095619/http://rhymeuniversity.com/| archivedate= 10 May 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bachelor's degree|Bachelors']] and [[Master's degree|masters']] gowns in the United States are similar to their counterparts in the United Kingdom, though bachelor's gowns are now designed to be worn closed, and all are at least mid-calf length to ankle-length.&lt;ref name=SullivanGowns&gt;Sullivan. The Academic Costume Code, ''Gowns''&lt;/ref&gt;  The masters' gown sleeve is [[rectangle|oblong]] and, though the base of the sleeve hangs down in the typical  manner, it is square cut at the rear part of the oblong shape.  The front part has an arc cut away, and there is a slit for the wrist opening, but the rest of the arc is closed. The shape is evocative of the square-cut [[liripipe]] incorporated into many academic hoods (''see'', below).  The master's gown is designed to be worn open or closed.&lt;ref name=SullivanGowns /&gt;

[[Doctorate|Doctoral]] robes are typically black, although some schools use robes in the [[school colors|school's colours]].&lt;ref name=SullivanGowns /&gt;  The Code calls for the outside shell of the hood (''see'', below) to remain black in that case, however.  In general, doctoral gowns are similar to the gowns worn by bachelor's graduates, with the addition of three velvet bands on the sleeves and velvet facing running down the front of the gown.  The Code calls for the gown trim to be either black or the colour designated for the field of study in which the doctorate was earned (see ''[[Academic regalia in the United States#Intercollegiate colors|Inter-Collegiate colors]]'').  However, it should be noted that in the case of the degree of [[Doctor of Philosophy]] (PhD), although it is awarded for study in any number of fields, the dark blue velvet of philosophy is always used regardless of the particular field studied. For example, if not choosing black trim, a PhD in theology would wear velvet gown trim in dark blue, while a [[Doctor of Theology]] (Th.D.) would wear scarlet trim, if not choosing black.  The robes have full sleeves, instead of the bell sleeves of the bachelor's gown. Some gowns expose a [[necktie]] or [[cravat]] when closed, while others take an almost cape-like form.  It is designed to be worn open or closed in the front.&lt;ref name=SullivanGowns /&gt;

The Code calls for the shell material of the hood to match the robe, and for the colour to be black regardless of the colour of the robe being worn.&lt;ref name=SullivanHoods&gt;Sullivan. The Academic Costume Code, ''Hoods''&lt;/ref&gt;  The interior lining – generally silk – displays the colours of the institution from which the wearer received the degree, in a pattern prescribed by it (usually, if more than one colour is used, [[chevron (insignia)|chevrons]] or equal divisions).&lt;ref name=SullivanTrimmingsGowns&gt;Sullivan. The Academic Costume Code, ''Hoods'';''Linings''&lt;/ref&gt;  The opening of the hood is [[trim (sewing)|trimmed]] in [[velvet]] or [[velveteen]].&lt;ref name=SullivanTrimmingsHoods&gt;Sullivan. The Academic Costume Code, ''Hoods'';''Trimmings''&lt;/ref&gt;  In most American colleges and universities, the colour of the velvet hood trimming is distinctive of the academic field – or as closely related as possible – to which the degree earned pertains (see ''[[Academic dress#Intercollegiate colors|Inter-Collegiate colors]]'').&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;Sullivan. The Academic Costume Code, ''Additional Guidance on Costume''&lt;/ref&gt;  Many institutions, particularly larger ones, have dispensed with the bachelor's hood at commencement ceremonies altogether, though a graduate is still entitled to wear one once the degree is conferred.&lt;ref name=SullivanExceptions&gt;Sullivan. The Academic Costume Code, ''Some Permissible Exceptions''&lt;/ref&gt;

Headwear is an important component of cap-and-gown, and the academic costume is not complete without it. The headwear will vary with the level of academic achievement and, to some extent, on the individual academic institution's specifications.  For caps, the mortarboard is recommended in the Code, and the material required to match the gown.&lt;ref name=SullivanCaps&gt;Sullivan. The Academic Costume Code, ''Caps''&lt;/ref&gt;  The exception—velvet—is reserved for the doctor's degree only, seen in the form of a multiple-sided (4, 6, or 8)  [[tam (cap)|tam]], but the four-sided mortarboard-shaped tam in velvet is what the Code seems to recommend here.&lt;ref name=SullivanCaps /&gt;  The only colour called for is black, in all cases.&lt;ref name=SullivanCaps /&gt;  The tassel worn on the mortarboard or a tam seems to provide, by tradition, the greatest opportunity for latitude in American academic dress.  It has been black, or represented the university's colours, or the colours of the specific college, or the discipline. The tassel has also been used to indicate membership in national [[honor society|honour societies]] or other awards. There is at some colleges and universities a practice of moving the tassel from one side to the other on graduating, but this is a modern innovation that would be impractical out of doors due to the vagaries of the wind.  For doctoral and masters students, the tassel commonly begins and remains on the left.&lt;ref name=SullivanWearing&gt;Sullivan. The Academic Costume Code, ''Wearing the Costume''&lt;/ref&gt;

The colours allocated to the various fields of learning have been largely standardized in the United States by the Intercollegiate Bureau of Academic Costume, and accepted by the American Council on Education in its ''Academic Costume Code.''&lt;ref name=SullivanTrimmingsGowns /&gt;  Some of the more common colours seen are that [[liberal arts]] is represented by white, science by golden yellow, medicine by green, law by purple, and philosophy (including all PhD degrees) by dark blue.  A distinction is made in the code, which calls for a graduate to display the colour of the subject of the degree obtained, not the degree itself.&lt;ref name=SullivanTrimmingsHoods&gt;Sullivan. The Academic Costume Code, Hoods, ''Trimmings''&lt;/ref&gt; For example, if a graduate is awarded a [[Bachelor of Arts]] (BA) degree specifically in business the trimming should be drab, representing commerce/accountancy/business, rather than white, representing the broader arts/letters/humanities; the same method is true of master's degrees and doctorates.  However, in 1986, the American Council on Education updated the Code and added the following sentence clarifying the use of the colour dark blue for the [[Doctor of Philosophy]] degree, which is awarded in any number of fields: &quot;In the case of the Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) degree, the dark blue colour is used to represent the mastery of the discipline of learning and scholarship in any field that is attested to by the awarding of the degree, and it is not intended to represent the field of philosophy.&quot;&lt;ref name=SullivanTrimmingsHoods/&gt;

A number of other items such as [[honor cords|cords]], [[academic stole|stoles]], [[aiguillette]]s, etc. representing various academic achievements or other honours are also worn at the discretion of some degree-granting institutions.  Technically, however, the ACE code does not allow their use on or over academic regalia.

==Pontifical Universities==
Academic dress for [[Pontifical university|Pontifical universities]] tends to vary by the host country.  Traditionally, for doctors of a pontifical university or faculty &quot;the principal mark of a Doctor's dignity is the four horned biretta.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;John Abel Nainfa, Costume of Prelates of The Catholic Church: According To Roman Etiquette, 164.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[commencement ceremony|commencement ceremonies]] and other academic settings, doctors from pontifical faculties and universities have a canonical right to wear the doctoral biretta as stated in the Codex Iuris Canonici, 1917, can. 1378, and explained in commentary 262 of the Commentarium Codicis Iuris Canonici as follows:
{{quote|262. Doctoratus ac Scentiae effectus canonici sic recensentur can. 1378...doctoribus seu gradum academicum in una ex quatuor supradictis facultatibus &lt;&lt;vide 261: philosophia, theologia, ius canonicum, Sacra Scriptura&gt;&gt; supremum obtinentibus, rite creatis, seu promotis regulariter post examen, iuxta « statuta a Sede Apostolica probata » (can. 1376, § 2) saltem quoad usum validum « facultatis ab eadem Aplca. Sede concessae » (can. 1377, § 1), deferendi, extra sacras functiones, (quarum nomine ad hunc eflectum non venit ex usu sacra praedicatio), nisi aliunde amplietur eis hoc ius quoad a) annulum etiam cum gemma « ipsis a iure huius canonis concessum » (can. 136, § 2), b) et biretum doctorale, (idest: cum quatuor apicibus) utpote insigne huius gradus ac diverso colore ornatum pro Facultate.:&lt;ref&gt;Codex Iuris Canonici, 1917, can. 1378; Commentarium Textus Codicis Iuris Canonici, 1923, comm. 262: Commentarium Codicis Iuris Canonici, 1922, Liber III, Pars IV, Tit. XXII, 262&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The Sartoria Gammerelli as of August 2013 offers, in line with the updated stipulations of the Pontifical Gregorian University, birettas lined with the following assorted piping and tufts depending on which faculty one is graduated from: Green for Canon Law, Red for Sacred Theology, Blue for Philosophy, and Orange for Social Sciences. Three-horned birettas are to be used by Licentiates, four-horned for Doctors.

Academic dress for the [[Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas|Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas, ''Angelicum'']] graduates consists of a black toga or academic gown with trim to follow the color of the faculty, and an academic ring.  For the Doctorate degree a four corned [[biretta]] is to be worn, and for the Licentiate degree a three corned [[biretta]] is to be worn. See:[http://www.pust.it/index.php/en/universita/233-vesti-accademiche-laureati-dellangelicum Academic regalia of the Pontifical University of St. Thomas Aquinas].  The 'traditional' biretta at the [[Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas|Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas, ''Angelicum'']], is white, to correspond to the white Dominican habit.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cantate-domino.blogspot.com/2008/04/some-info-on-academic-birettas-and-such.html Accessed 3-25-2011]&lt;/ref&gt; Also, the academic senate of the ''Angelicum'' in its May 2011 meeting indicated that the black biretta may be used with trim and pom in the color of the particular faculty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pust.it/index.php/en/universita/233-vesti-accademiche-laureati-dellangelicum |title=Ring, Biretta and Gown for Graduates |publisher=Pust.it |date=2011-06-15 |accessdate=2013-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A three-peaked black biretta with appropriately colored piping may be similarly used by those receiving the licentiate degree (S.T.L., Ph.L.).

{{distinguish2|[[Overcoat]], a garment meant solely as an outer garment}}
[[File:FalatJulian.PortretAntoniegoWodzickiego.1900.ws.jpg|thumb|Man wearing a coat, painting by [[Julian Fałat]], 1900]]
A '''coat''' is a [[clothing|garment]] worn by both men and women,&lt;ref name=&quot;OEDcoat&quot;&gt;[[Oxford English Dictionary]]. (1989) 2nd ed. '''coat, ''n. 1''''' &quot;An outer garment worn by men...&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; for warmth or [[fashion]]. Coats typically have long [[sleeve]]s and are open down the front, closing by means of [[button]]s, [[zipper]]s, [[Velcro|hook-and-loop fasteners]], toggles, a [[belt (clothing)|belt]], or a combination of some of these. Other possible features include [[Collar (clothing)|collar]]s, [[shoulder strap]]s and [[hood (headgear)|hood]]s.
Persian were the first people that made a coat.

==Etymology==
The Persians, based in what is now Iran, introduced two garments to the history of clothing: [[trousers]] and seamed fitted coats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Encarta|url=http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761569657_3/Clothing.html#p39|work=|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5kwR9Tp6U|archivedate=2009-10-31|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Coat'' is one of the earliest clothing category words in [[English language|English]], attested as far back as the early [[Middle Ages]].  (''See also'' [[Clothing terminology]].) An early use of ''coat'' in English is [[Mail (armour)|coat of mail]] (chainmail), a tunic-like garment of metal rings, usually knee — or mid-calf length.

The medieval and renaissance coat (generally spelled ''cote'' by costume historians) is a midlength, [[sleeve]]d men's outer garment, fitted to the waist and buttoned up the front, with a full skirt in its essentials, not unlike the modern coat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Coats:A discussion of garment, evolution,and identity|last=Goldentul|first=Zhanna|authorlink=Zhanna Goldentul|author2=University of Louisville|year=2009|publisher=ProQuest|location=|isbn=978-1-109-30027-7|page=4|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=o962DLv8QrUC&amp;lpg=PA4&amp;vq=coat&amp;pg=PA4|accessdate=14 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the eighteenth century, overcoats had begun to supplant [[cape]]s and [[cloak]]s as outerwear, and by the mid-twentieth century the terms ''jacket'' and ''coat'' became confused for recent styles; the difference in use is still maintained for older garments.

==Coats, jackets and overcoats==

In the early nineteenth century, coats were divided into under-coats and overcoats. The term under-coat is now archaic but denoted the fact that the word ''coat'' could be both the outermost layer for outdoor wear ([[overcoat]]) or the coat worn under that (under-coat). However, the term ''coat'' has begun to denote just the overcoat rather than the under-coat.&lt;ref name=&quot;OEDcoat&quot;/&gt; The older usage of the word ''coat'' can still be found in the expression &quot;to wear a coat and tie&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;McGraw-Hill Dictionary of American Idioms and Phrasal Verbs (2002)&lt;/ref&gt; which does not mean that wearer has on an overcoat. Nor do the terms ''[[tailcoat]]'', ''[[morning coat]]'' or house coat denote types of [[overcoat]]. Indeed, an overcoat may be worn over the top of a [[tailcoat]]. In tailoring circles, the [[tailor]] who makes all types of coats is called a ''coat maker''. Similarly, in American English, the term ''[[sports coat]]'' is used to denote a type of [[jacket]] not worn as outerwear (overcoat) (''sports jacket'' in British English).

The term ''jacket'' is a traditional term usually used to refer to a specific type of short under-coat.&lt;ref name=&quot;OEDjacket&quot;&gt;[[Oxford English Dictionary]]. (1989) 2nd ed. '''jacket, ''n.''''' &quot;...a short coat without tails...&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Typical modern jackets extend only to the upper thigh in length, whereas older coats such as [[tailcoat]]s are usually of knee length. The modern jacket worn with a suit is traditionally called a ''[[lounge suit|lounge coat]]'' (or a ''lounge jacket'') in British English and a ''sack coat'' in American English. The American English term is rarely used. Traditionally, the majority of  men dressed in a ''coat and tie'', although this has become gradually less widespread since the 1960s. Because the basic pattern for the [[stroller (style)|stroller]] (black jacket worn with striped trousers in [[British English]]) and [[dinner jacket]] ([[tuxedo]] in [[American English]]) are the same as lounge coats, tailors traditionally call both of these special types of jackets a ''coat''um

An overcoat is designed to be worn as the outermost garment worn as outdoor wear;&lt;ref name=&quot;OEDovercoat&quot;&gt;[[Oxford English Dictionary]]. (1989) 2nd ed. '''overcoat, ''n.''''' &quot;A large coat worn over the ordinary clothing...&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; while this use is still maintained in some places, particularly in Britain, elsewhere the term ''coat'' is commonly used mainly to denote only the overcoat, and not the under-coat. A ''topcoat'' is a slightly shorter{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}} overcoat, if any distinction is to be made. Overcoats worn over the top of knee length coats (under-coats) such as [[frock coat]]s, [[tailcoat|dress coats]], and [[morning dress|morning coats]] are cut to be a little longer than the under-coat so as to completely cover it, as well as being large enough to accommodate the coat underneath.

The length of an overcoat varies: mid-calf being the most frequently found and the default when current fashion isn't concerned with hemlines. Designs vary from knee-length to the ankle length briefly fashionable in the early 1970s and known (to contrast with the usurped [[mini-skirt|mini]]) as the &quot;maxi&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;TheSeventies&quot;&gt;Christopher Booker (1980) The Seventies&lt;/ref&gt;

Speakers of [[American English]] sometimes informally use the words ''jacket'' and ''coat'' interchangeably.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'', [[Oxford University Press]], 1971&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:suit.jpg|thumb|A man in a contemporary business suit]]

In clothing, a '''suit''' is a set of garments made from the same cloth, usually consisting of at least a jacket and trousers. '''Lounge suits''' (also known as '''business suits''' when sober in colour and style), which originated  in Britain as country wear,&lt;ref&gt;Antongiavanni (2006). p. 74&lt;/ref&gt; are the most common style of Western suit. Other types of suit still worn today are the ''dinner suit'', part of [[black tie]], which arose as a lounging alternative to [[dress coat]]s in much the same way as the day lounge suit came to replace [[frock coat]]s and [[morning coat]]s; and, rarely worn today, the [[Morning dress#Morning suit|morning suit]].  This article discusses the lounge suit (including business suits), elements of [[informal attire|informal]] [[dress code (Western)|dress code]].

The variations in design, cut, and cloth, such as two- and three- piece, or single- and double- breasted, determine the social and work suitability of the garment. Often, suits are worn, as is traditional, with a [[Collar (clothing)|collared]] [[dress shirt|shirt]] and [[necktie]].&lt;ref&gt;Flusser (2002). p. 146&lt;/ref&gt;  Until around the 1960s, as with all men's clothes, a hat would have been also worn when the wearer was outdoors. Suits also come with different numbers of pieces: a two-piece suit has a jacket and the trousers; a three piece adds a [[waistcoat]] (known as a [[vest]] in North America); further pieces might include a [[flat cap]] made from the same cloth.

Originally, as with most clothes, a [[tailor]] made the suit from his client's selected cloth; these are now often known as ''bespoke'' suits. The suit was custom made to the measurements, taste, and style of the man. Since the [[Industrial Revolution]], most suits are mass-produced, and, as such, are sold as ready-to-wear garments (though alteration by a tailor prior to wearing is common). Currently, suits are sold in roughly four ways:
*''[[bespoke]]'', in which the garment is custom-made by a tailor from a pattern created entirely from the customer's measurements, giving the best fit and free choice of fabric;
*''[[made to measure]]'', in which a pre-made pattern is modified to fit the customer, and a limited selection of options and fabrics is available; 
*''[[ready-to-wear]]'' or off-the-peg, which is sold ready to be tailored or finally as 
*''suit separates'' where jacket and trousers are sold separately,  allowing a customer to choose the size that is best for them and limit the amount of alterations needed.&lt;ref&gt;Antongiavanni (2006). p. 35&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{Main|History of suits}}
The current styles were founded in the industrial revolution during the late 18th century that sharply changed the elaborately embroidered and jewelled formal clothing into the simpler clothing of the [[British Regency]] period, which gradually evolved to the stark formality of the [[Victorian era]]. It was in the search for more comfort that the loosening of rules gave rise in the late 19th century to the modern lounge suit.

==Etymology==
The word ''suit'' derives from the [[French language|French]] ''suite'',&lt;ref&gt;[[Oxford English Dictionary]] Online (2008). ''suit'', n. 19b.&lt;/ref&gt; meaning &quot;following&quot;, from some [[Late Latin]] derivative form of the Latin verb ''sequor'' = &quot;I follow&quot;, because the component garments (jacket and trousers and [[waistcoat]]) follow each other and have the same cloth and colour and are worn together.

As a suit (in this sense) covers all or most of the wearer's body, the term &quot;suit&quot; was extended to a single garment that covers all or most of the body, such as [[boilersuit]]s and [[diving suit]]s and [[spacesuit]]s (see ''[[Suit (disambiguation)]]'').

[[Brooks Brothers]] is generally credited with first offering the &quot;ready-to-wear&quot; suit, a suit which was sold already manufactured and sized, ready to be tailored.  It was [[Haggar Clothing]] that first introduced the concept of suit separates in the US, the concept of separately sold jackets and trousers, which are widely found in the marketplace today.

==Parts of a suit==
There are many possible variations in the choice of the style, the garments and the details of a suit.

===The cut===
[[File:Gentleman in bowler.JPG|thumb|upright|A man dressed in a three-piece suit and [[bowler hat]].]]
The silhouette of a suit is its outline. Tailored balance created from a canvas fitting allows a balanced silhouette so a jacket need not be buttoned and a garment is not too tight or too loose.  A proper garment is shaped from the neck to the chest and shoulders to drape without wrinkles from tension. Shape is the essential part of tailoring that often takes hand work from the start.  The two main cuts are 1) ''[[double-breasted]]'' suits, a conservative design with two columns of buttons, spanned by a large overlap of the left and right sides; and 2) ''[[single-breasted]]'' suits, in which the sides overlap very slightly, with a single column of buttons.

Good tailoring anywhere in the world is characterised by strongly tapered sides and minimal shoulder, whereas often rack suits are padded to reduce labour. More casual suits are characterised by less construction and tailoring, much like the [[sack suit]] is a loose American style.&lt;ref name=&quot;Flusser85ch2&quot;&gt;Flusser (1985). [http://www.throughtherye.com/flusser/ch2.htm ch. 2]&lt;/ref&gt;

There are 3 ways to make suits:
# Ready made and altered &quot;sizes&quot; or precut shapes; a convenience that often is expressed over time with wrinkles from poor shaping, leading to distortion;
# The made-to-measure suit that uses measurements, not shaping, to achieve things like style, lengths and horizontal measurements;
# The custom, bespoke or tailoring-designed suit that has interim half-made fittings and is cut from an actual personal pattern.

The acid test of authentic tailoring standards is the wrinkle that comes from poor tailoring. Rumples can be pressed out. For interim fittings, &quot;Rock Of Eye&quot; (which means trained freehand based on an experienced artistic eye to match the item to the wearer, trusting the eye over unyielding scripted approach), drawing and cutting inaccuracies are overcome by the fitting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.englishcut.com/archives/2005_02.html | title = How to draft a pattern | accessdate = 2008-09-20 | last = Mahon | first = Thomas | date = 2005-09-23 | work = English Cut}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fabric===
Suits are made in a variety of fabrics, but most commonly from wool. The two main yarns produce [[worsted]]s (where the fibres are [[combing|combed]] before [[spinning (textiles)|spinning]] to produce a smooth, hard wearing cloth) and [[Woolen|woollen]]s (where they are not, thus remaining comparatively fluffy in texture). These can be woven in a number of ways producing [[flannel]], [[tweed (cloth)|tweed]], [[gabardine]], and fresco among others. These fabrics all have different weights and feel, and some fabrics have an [[Super S or S number|S (or Super S) number]] describing the fineness of the fibres measured by average fibre diameter, e.g., Super 120; however, the finer the fabric, the more delicate and thus less likely to be long-wearing it will be. Although wool has traditionally been associated with warm, bulky clothing meant for warding off cold weather, advances in making finer and finer fibre have made wool suits acceptable for warmer weather, as fabrics have accordingly become lighter and more supple. Wool fabric is denominated by the weight of a one-square yard piece; thus, the heavier wools, suitable for winter only, are 12-14 oz.; the medium, &quot;three season&quot; (i.e., excluding summer) are 10-11 oz.; and summer wools are 7-8 oz.  (In the days before central heating, heavier wools such as 16 oz. were used in suits; now they are used mainly in overcoats and topcoats.) Other materials are used sometimes, either alone or blended with wool, such as [[cashmere wool|cashmere]].&lt;ref&gt;Antongiavanni (2006). p. 76&lt;/ref&gt;  Silk alone or blended with wool is sometimes used. Synthetic materials, while cheaper, e.g., polyester, are very rarely recommended by experts. At most, a blend of predominantly wool may be acceptable to obtain the main benefit of synthetics, namely resistance to wrinkling, particularly in garments used for travel; however, any synthetic, blended or otherwise, will always be warmer and clammier than wool alone.{{Citation needed|date=June 2013}}  For hot weather, [[linen]] is also used, and in (Southern) North America [[cotton]] [[seersucker]] is worn.

The main four colours for suits worn in business are black, light grey, dark grey, and navy, either with or without patterns. In particular, grey flannel [[wiktionary:suiting|suiting]] has been worn very widely since the 1930s. In non-business settings or less-formal business contexts, brown is another important colour; olive also occurs. In summer, lighter shades such as tan or cream are popular.&lt;ref&gt;Flusser (2002). pp. 93–99&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Antongiavanni (2006). pp. 80–86&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:One For the Suits.jpg|thumb|left|A pinstripe suit]]
For non-business use [[tweed (cloth)|tweed]] has been popular since Victorian times, and still is commonly worn. A wide range of colour is available, including muted shades of green, brown, red, and grey.&lt;ref&gt;Flusser (2002). p. 95&lt;/ref&gt;  Tweeds are usually checked, or plain with a [[herringbone (cloth)|herringbone weave]], and are most associated with the country. While full tweed suits are not worn by many now, the jackets are often worn as [[sports jacket]]s with odd trousers (trousers of different cloth).

The most conventional suit is a 2- or 3-button and either medium to dark grey or navy. Other conservative colours are greys, black, and olive. White and light blues are acceptable at some events, especially in the warm season. Red and the brighter greens are usually considered &quot;unconventional&quot; and &quot;garish&quot;.  Tradition calls for a gentleman's suit to be of decidedly plain colour, with splashes of bright colour reserved for shirts, neckties or kerchiefs.

In the United States and the United Kingdom, around the start of the 20th century, lounge suits were never traditionally worn in plain black, this colour instead being reserved for formal wear&lt;ref name=&quot;Antongiavanni06.81&quot;&gt;Antongiavanni (2006). p. 81&lt;/ref&gt; (including [[dinner jacket]]s or [[stroller (style)|stroller]]s), and for [[undertaker]]s. However, the decline of formal wear since the 1950s and the rise of casual wear in 1960s allowed the black suit to return to fashion, as many designers began wanting to move away from the business suit toward more fashion suits.

Traditional business suits are generally in solid colours or with [[pin stripes]];&lt;ref&gt;Flusser (2002). p. 94&lt;/ref&gt; windowpane checks are also acceptable. Outside business, the range of acceptable patterns widens, with plaids such as the traditional [[glen plaid]] and herringbone, though apart from some very traditional environments such as London banking, these are worn for business now too. The colour of the patterned element (stripes, [[plaid (pattern)|plaid]]s, and [[check (fabric)|check]]s) varies by gender and location. For example, bold checks, particularly with tweeds, have fallen out of use in the US, while they continue to be worn as traditionally in Britain. Some unusual old patterns such as diamonds are now rare everywhere.

Inside the jacket of a suit, between the outer fabric and the inner [[lining (sewing)|lining]], there is a layer of sturdy [[interfacing]] fabric to prevent the wool from stretching out of shape; this layer of cloth is called the [[canvas]] after the fabric from which it was traditionally made. Expensive jackets have a ''[[floating canvas]]'', while cheaply manufactured models have a ''fused'' (glued) canvas.&lt;ref&gt;Flusser (2002). p. 288&lt;/ref&gt; A fused canvas is less soft and, if poorly done, damages the suppleness and durability of the jacket,&lt;ref&gt;Antongiavanni (2006). p. 66&lt;/ref&gt; so many tailors are quick to deride fused canvas as being less durable, particularly since they may tend to permanently pucker along the jacket's edges after some use or a few dry cleanings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.englishcut.com/archives/000020.html | title = Fused vs. floating | accessdate = 2008-09-20 | last = Mahon | first = Thomas | date =  2005-02-08 | work = English Cut}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, some selling this type of jacket claim that the difference in quality is very small.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.desmerrionbespoketailor.com/folders/weblog/20081108/ |last=Merrion |first=Desmond |title=Recent made to measure tailoring |date=2008-11-08 |accessdate=2008-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; A few London tailors state that all [[bespoke]] suits should use a floating canvas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.englishcut.com/archives/000005.html | title = How to pick a &quot;bespoke&quot; tailor | accessdate = 2008-09-20 | last = Mahon | first = Thomas | date =  2005-01-06 | work = English Cut}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jacket===

====Front buttons====
[[File:Single-Double-Breasted.svg|thumb|Single- vs. double-breasted jacket]]
Most [[single-breasted]] suits have two or three buttons, and one or four buttons are unusual (except that dinner jackets (&quot;black tie&quot;) often have only one button). It is rare to find a suit with more than four buttons, although [[zoot suits]] can have as many as six or more due to their longer length. There is also variation in the placement and style of buttons,&lt;ref&gt;Druesdow (1990). p. vi. &quot;...for often the difference in style from season to season was in the distance between buttons...&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; since the button placement is critical to the overall impression of height conveyed by the jacket. The centre or top button will typically line up quite closely with the natural waistline.&lt;ref&gt;Flusser (2002). p. 83&lt;/ref&gt; There seems to be no clear rule as to which side the overlap should lie. It usually crosses naturally with the left side to the fore but not invariably. Generally, a hidden button holds the underlap in place.

Double-breasted jackets have only half their outer buttons functional, as the second row is for display only, forcing them to come in pairs. Some rare jackets can have as few as two buttons, and during various periods, for instance the 1960s and 70s, as many as eight were seen. Six buttons are typical, with two to button; the last pair floats above the overlap. The three buttons down each side may in this case be in a straight line (the 'keystone' layout) or more commonly, the top pair is half as far apart again as each pair in the bottom square. A four-button double-breasted jacket usually buttons in a square.&lt;ref&gt;Antongiavanni (2006). p. 14&lt;/ref&gt;  The layout of the buttons and the shape of the lapel are co-ordinated in order to direct the eyes of an observer. For example, if the buttons are too low, or the lapel roll too pronounced, the eyes are drawn down from the face, and the waist appears larger.&lt;ref&gt;Antongiavanni (2006). p. 16&lt;/ref&gt;

====Lapels====
{{Main|Jacket lapel}}
[[File:Notch lapel.svg|thumb|left|100|A notched lapel]]
[[File:Peak lapel.svg|thumb|left|100|A peaked lapel]]
[[File:Shawl lapel.svg|thumb|left|100|A shawl lapel]]

The jacket's lapels can be notched (also called &quot;stepped&quot;), peaked (&quot;pointed&quot;), shawl, or &quot;trick&quot; (Mandarin and other unconventional styles). Each lapel style carries different connotations, and is worn with different cuts of suit. Notched lapels are only found on single-breasted jackets and are the most informal style. Double-breasted jackets usually have peaked lapels. Shawl lapels are a style derived from the Victorian informal evening wear, and as such are not normally seen on suit jackets except for dinner suits.&lt;ref&gt;Flusser (2002). pp. 82–85&lt;/ref&gt; For [[black tie event]]s, only jackets with pointed and shawl lapels should be worn.&lt;ref&gt;[https://wordsbysimonpaul.wordpress.com/tag/etiquette/ The Imperative Etiquette of Black Tie Eveningwear]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1980s, double-breasted suits with notched lapels were popular with [[Power suit (clothing)|power suits]] and the [[New Wave (clothing)|New Wave]] style.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}

In the late 1920s and 1930s, a design considered very stylish was the single-breasted peaked lapel jacket. This has gone in and out of vogue periodically, being popular once again during the 1970s,{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}} and is still a recognised alternative. The ability to properly cut peak lapels on a single-breasted suit is one of the most challenging tailoring tasks, even for very experienced tailors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.englishcut.com/archives/000052.html | title = Single-breasted, peaked lapel | accessdate = 2008-09-20 | last = Mahon | first = Thomas | date =  2005-03-29 | work = English Cut}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The width of the lapel is a varying aspect of suits, and has changed over the years. The 1930s and 1970s featured exceptionally wide lapels, whereas during the late 1950s and most of the 1960s suits with very narrow lapels&amp;mdash;often only about an inch wide&amp;mdash;were in fashion. The 1980s saw mid-size lapels with a low gorge (the point on the jacket that forms the &quot;notch&quot; or &quot;peak&quot; between the collar and front lapel). Current (mid-2000s) trends are towards a narrower lapel and higher gorge.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}} Necktie width usually follows the width of the jacket lapel.

Lapels also have a [[buttonhole]], intended to hold a [[boutonnière]], a decorative flower. These are now only commonly seen at more formal events. Usually double-breasted suits have one hole on each lapel (with a flower just on the left), while single-breasted suits have just one on the left.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Boehlke | first = Will | title = What's in your lapel? | work = A Suitable Wardrobe | date = 2007-01-07 | url = http://asuitablewardrobe.dynend.com/2007/01/whats-in-your-lapel.html | accessdate = 2008-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Pockets====
{{Main|Jacket pocket}}
Most jackets have a variety of inner pockets, and two main outer pockets, which are generally either patch pockets, flap pockets, or jetted (&quot;besom&quot;) pockets.&lt;ref&gt;The Nu-Way Course in Fashionable Clothes Making (1926). [http://vintagesewing.info/1920s/26-fcm/fcm-33.html Lesson 33]&lt;/ref&gt;
The patch pocket is, with its single extra piece of cloth sewn directly onto the front of the jacket, a sporting option, sometimes seen on summer linen suits, or other informal styles. The flap pocket is standard for side pockets, and has an extra lined flap of matching fabric covering the top of the pocket. A jetted pocket is most formal, with a small strip of fabric taping the top and bottom of the slit for the pocket. This style is most often on seen on [[formalwear]], such as a [[dinner jacket]].

A breast pocket is usually found at the left side, where a [[pocket square]] or handkerchief can be displayed.

In addition to the standard two outer pockets and breast pocket, some suits have a fourth, the ticket pocket, usually located just above the right pocket and roughly half as wide. While this was originally exclusively a feature of country suits, used for conveniently storing a train ticket, it is now seen on some town suits. Another country feature also worn sometimes in cities is a pair of hacking pockets, which are similar to normal ones, but slanted; this was originally designed to make the pockets easier to open on horseback while [[equestrianism|hacking]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Flusser85ch2&quot;/&gt;

====Sleeves====
Suit jackets in all styles typically have three or four [[button]]s on each cuff, which are often purely decorative (the sleeve is usually sewn closed and cannot be unbuttoned to open). Five buttons are unusual and are a modern fashion innovation. The number of buttons is primarily a function of the formality of the suit; a very casual summer [[sports jacket]] might traditionally (1930s) have had only one button, while tweed suits typically have three and city suits four. In the 1970s, two buttons were seen on some city suits.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}} Today, four buttons are common on most business suits and even casual suits.

Although the sleeve buttons usually cannot be undone, the stitching is such that it appears they could. Functional cuff buttons may be found on high-end or bespoke suits; this feature is called a ''surgeon's cuff'' and &quot;working button holes&quot; (U.S.).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.englishcut.com/archives/000215.html |first=Thomas |last=Mahon | date=2007-01-18 |accessdate=2008-10-26 | title=Real cuff holes... |work=English Cut}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some wearers leave these buttons undone to reveal that they can afford a bespoke suit, although it is proper to leave these buttons done up.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/14/business/14saks.html|title=For Fine Recession Wear, $7,000 Suits From Saks (Off the Rack) |last=Rosenbloom|first=Stephanie|date=February 13, 2009|publisher=[[New York Times]]|accessdate=2009-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modern bespoke styles and high end off-the-rack suits equipped with surgeon's cuffs have the last two buttons stitched off-centre, so that the sleeve hangs more cleanly should the buttons ever be undone.  Certainty in fitting sleeve length must be achieved, as once working button holes are cut, the sleeve length essentially cannot be altered further.

A cuffed sleeve has an extra length of fabric folded back over the arm, or just some piping or stitching above the buttons to allude to the edge of a cuff. This was popular in the Edwardian era, as a feature of formalwear such as [[frock coat]]s carried over to informalwear, but is now rare.

====Vents====
A [[Vent (tailoring)|vent]] is a slit in the bottom rear (the &quot;tail&quot;) of the jacket. Originally, vents were a sporting option, designed to make riding easier, so are traditional on hacking jackets, formal coats such as a [[morning coat]], and, for practicality, overcoats. Today there are three styles of venting: the single-vented style (with one vent at the centre); the ventless style; and the double-vented style (one vent on each side). Vents are convenient, particularly when using a pocket or sitting down, to improve the hang of the jacket,&lt;ref&gt;Antongiavanni (2006). p. 172&lt;/ref&gt; so are now used on most jackets. Ventless jackets are associated with Italian tailoring, while the double-vented style is typically British.&lt;ref name=&quot;Flusser85ch2&quot;/&gt; (This is not the case with all types of jackets. For instance, [[dinner jacket]]s traditionally take no vents.)

===Waistcoats===
{{Main|Waistcoat}}
[[File:Waistcoat.jpg|thumb|A traditional waistcoat, to be worn with a two-piece suit or separate jacket and trousers.]]
Waistcoats (called ''vests'' in American English) were almost always worn with suits prior to the 1940s. Due to rationing during [[World War II]], their prevalence declined, but their popularity has gone in and out of fashion from the 1970s onwards. A [[pocket watch]] on a chain, one end of which is inserted through a middle buttonhole, is often worn with a waistcoat; otherwise, since [[World War I]] when they came to prominence of military necessity, men have worn wristwatches, which may be worn with any suit except the full evening dress ([[white tie]]). Although many examples of waistcoats worn with a double-breasted jacket can be found from the 1920s to the 1940s, that would be unusual today (one point of a double-breasted jacket being, it may be supposed, to eliminate the waistcoat). Traditionally, the bottom button of a waistcoat is left undone; like the vents in the rear of a jacket, this helps the body bend when sitting. Some waistcoats can have lapels, others do not.

===Trousers===
Suit trousers are always made of the same material as the jacket. Even from the 1910s to 1920s, before the invention of sports jackets specifically to be worn with odd trousers, wearing a suit jacket with odd trousers was seen as an alternative to a full suit.&lt;ref&gt;Flusser (2002). p. 100&lt;/ref&gt; However, with the modern advent of sports jackets, suit jackets are always worn with matching trousers, and the trousers have always been worn with the appropriate jacket.{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}}

Trouser width has varied considerably throughout the decades. In the 1920s, trousers were straight-legged and wide-legged, with a standard width at the cuff of 23&amp;nbsp;inches. After 1935, trousers began to be tapered in at the bottom half of the leg. Trousers remained wide at the top of the leg throughout the 1940s. By the 1950s and 1960s, a more slim look had become popular. In the 1970s, suit makers offered a variety of styles of trousers, including flared, bell bottomed, wide-legged, and more traditional tapered trousers. In the 1980s these styles disappeared in favour of tapered, slim-legged trousers.

One variation in the design of trousers is the use or not of pleats. The most classic style of trouser is to have two pleats, usually forward, since this gives more comfort sitting and better hang standing.&lt;ref&gt;Flusser (2002). p. 92&lt;/ref&gt; This is still a common style, and for these reasons of utility has been worn throughout the 20th century. The style originally descended from the exaggeratedly widened [[Oxford bags]] worn in the 1930s in Oxford, which, though themselves short-lived, began a trend for fuller fronts.&lt;ref&gt;Flusser (2002). p. 112&lt;/ref&gt; The style is still seen as the smartest, featuring on dress trousers with black and white tie. However, at various periods throughout the last century, flat fronted trousers with no pleats have been worn, and the swing in fashions has been marked enough that the more fashion-oriented ready-to-wear brands have not produced both types continuously.

Turn-ups on the bottom of trousers, or cuffs, were initially popularised in the 1890s by [[Edward VII]],&lt;ref&gt;Flusser (2002). p. 284&lt;/ref&gt; and were popular with suits throughout the 1920s and 1930s. After falling out of style in World War II, they were not generally popular again, despite serving the useful purpose of adding weight to straighten the hang of the trousers. They have always been an informal option, being inappropriate on all formalwear.

Other variations in trouser style include the rise of the trouser. This was very high in the early half of the 20th century, particularly with formalwear, with rises above the natural waist,&lt;ref&gt;Croonborg (1907). p. 100 lists tables of trousers heights&lt;/ref&gt; to allow the waistcoat covering the waistband to come down just below the narrowest point of the chest. Though serving less purpose, this high height was duplicated in the daywear of the period. Since then, fashions have changed, and have rarely been that high again with styles returning more to low-rise trousers, even dropping down to have waistbands resting on the hips. Other changing aspects of the cut include the length, which determines the break, the bunching of fabric just above the shoe when the front seam is marginally longer than height to the shoe's top. Some parts of the world, such as Europe, traditionally opt for shorter trousers with little or no break, while Americans often choose to wear a slight break.&lt;ref&gt;Flusser (2002). p. 61&lt;/ref&gt;

A final major distinction is made in whether the trousers take a [[Belt (clothing)|belt]] or [[Braces (clothing)|braces]] (suspenders). While a belt was originally never worn with a suit, the forced wearing of belts during wartime years (caused by restrictions on use of elastic caused by wartime shortages) contributed to their rise in popularity, with braces now much less popular than belts. When braces were common, the buttons for attaching them were placed on the outside of the waistband, because they would be covered by a waistcoat or cardigan, but now it is more frequent to button on the inside of the trouser. Trousers taking braces are rather different in cut at the waist, employing inches of extra girth and also height at the back. The split in the waistband at the back is in the ''fishtail'' shape.  Those who prefer braces assert that, because they hang from the shoulders, they always make the trousers fit and hang exactly as they should, while a belt may allow the trouser waist to slip down on the hips or below a protruding midsection, and requires constant repositioning; also, they allow, indeed work best with, a slightly looser waist which gives room for natural expansion when seated.

Suit trousers, also known as '''dress pants''' in the US, are a style of [[trousers]] intended as [[formal wear|formal]] or [[semi-formal]] wear. They are often made of either [[wool]] or [[polyester]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.overstock.com/guides/Mens-Dress-Pants-Buying-Guide| title = Dress pants fabric information| publisher = Overstock.com| accessdate = 2010-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; (although many other [[synthetic material|synthetic]] and natural textiles are used) and may be designed to be worn with a matching suit jacket. Suit trousers have a [[wikt:crease|crease]] on them because of their tight-fitting nature. Suit trousers can be worn at many formal and semi-formal occasions combined with a shirt that has no tie and a more relaxed fashion, which can be considered [[smart casual]] dress.

===Breeches===
As an alternative to trousers, [[breeches]] (or ''knickers'' in variations of English where this does not refer to underwear) may be worn with informal suits, such as tweed. These are shorter, descending to just below the knees, fastened closely at the top of the calf by a tab or button cuff. While once common, they are now typically only worn when engaged in traditional outdoor sports, such as [[shooting]] or [[golf]]. The length and design is closely related to the [[plus-fours]] (and plus-sixes etc.) worn for sport, but differ in having no bagginess. They are usually designed to be worn with long socks meeting just below the knee, but riding breeches, worn with long boots such as [[top boots]], are long enough to meet the boot and display no sock.&lt;ref&gt;Croonborg (1907). p. 118&lt;/ref&gt;

===Accessories===
Accessories for suits include neckties, shoes, wrist- and pocket watches, pocket squares, cuff links, tie tacks, tie bars, bow ties and hats.

== Situations for wearing and perceptions of suits ==
{{Globalize/US|date=November 2009}}

=== In the Mediterranean ===
Suits are less usual around the [[Mediterranean]], because of the high heat and humidity, that make the suits impractical without constant [[air conditioning]]. As a result, most non conservative businesses, regardless of size or wealth tend to use casual clothes even in formal meetings. Some professions, such as banking, law, and certain government employees that deal directly with the public do have a more formal dresscode. (Similarly, some Israeli branches of American firms tend to imitate their American counterpart's style of clothing)

=== In the Philippines ===
In the tropical Philippines, a former colony of the United States of America, a suit is often called a ''kano'', short for ''Amerikano'' (&quot;American&quot; in various Philippine languages). It is considered formal wear and only seen at formal social or business events, especially if the event is in Manila and involves the highest of corporate or government officials or Westerners.  Most Filipinos will rarely wear a suit, perhaps only at a high school or college [[prom]], in which case it might be rented.  At any occasion where a suit is worn, it would also be acceptable to wear a long-sleeved  or a short-sleeved [[barong tagalog]], the national dress of the Philippines.

=== In the United States ===

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The style of an interview suit, however, will depend on the [[organizational culture]] of the industry in which a person seeks employment.

In modern society, men's suits have become less common as an outfit of daily wear. During the 1990s, driven in part by the meteoric rise of newly successful [[technology]] companies with different cultural attitudes, the prevailing management philosophy of the time moved in favour of more casual attire for employees; the aim was to encourage a sense of openness and egalitarianism. &quot;Business casual&quot; dress still tends to be the norm for most workers up to and sometimes including mid-level management. Traditional business dress as an everyday style is generally limited to middle- and upper-level corporate management (now sometimes collectively referred to as &quot;suits&quot;),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
|title=Concise Oxford English Dictionary 10th ed
|publisher=Oxford University Press
|year=2002
|page=1433 &quot;''informal'' a high-ranking business executive&quot;
}}&lt;/ref&gt; and to the professions (particularly [[law]]). Casual dress has also become common in Western academic institutions.

For many men who do not wear suits for work, particularly in Western society, wearing a suit is reserved for special occasions, such as weddings, funerals, court appearances, and other more formal social events. Hence, because they are not a daily outfit for most men, they are often viewed as being &quot;stuffy&quot; and uncomfortable. The combination of a tie, belt and vest can be tight and restrictive compared to contemporary casual wear, especially when these are purchased at minimal cost and quality for rare occasions, rather than being made to be worn comfortably. This tendency became prevalent enough that the [[Christian Science Monitor]] reported that a suit combined with a necktie and slacks was &quot;a design that guarantees that its wearer will be uncomfortable.&quot;
&lt;ref&gt;[http://features.csmonitor.com/environment/2009/09/05/to-save-power-bangladesh-bans-suits-and-ties/ To save power, Bangladesh bans suits and ties], Christian Science Monitor, September 5, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; During the late 1960s and early 1970s, men's suits became less commonly worn, in much the same way that skirts and [[dress]]es were dropped by many women in favour of trousers. This was seen as a liberation from the conformity of earlier periods and occurred concurrently with the [[Feminism|women's liberation movement]].

Also remarkable is that the suit now frequently appears in Rock, Heavy Metal and Gothic happenings, even though such groups were once known for a rather rebellious tradition of clothing. Artists and bands such as [[Nick Cave]], [[Marilyn Manson]], [[Blutengel]] and [[Akercocke]] are known for the use of formal clothing in music videos and stage performances. The suit also appears when fans dress for styles such as Lolita, Victorian and Corporate Gothic.

===Buttoning the suit jacket===
[[File:The Duke and Duchess of Kent.jpg|thumb|right|[[Prince George, Duke of Kent]] in the early 1930s wearing a double-breasted suit with only the bottom buttons fastened]]
The buttoning of the jacket is primarily determined by the ''button stance'', a measure of how high the buttons are in relation to the natural waist. In some (now unusual) styles where the buttons are placed high, the tailor would have intended the suit to be buttoned differently from the more common lower stance. Nevertheless, some general guidelines are given here.

[[Double-breasted]] suit coats are almost always kept buttoned. When there is more than one button to fasten (as in a traditional six-on-two arrangement), only the top one need be fastened; in some configurations, the wearer may elect to fasten only the bottom button, in order to present a longer line (a style popularised by [[Prince George, Duke of Kent]]).
[[File:A man in nangli wazidpur in tradinal dress.jpg|thumb|A man in India in Suit]]

[[Single-breasted]] suit coats may be either fastened or unfastened. In two-button suits the bottom button is traditionally left unfastened except with certain unusual cuts of jacket, e.g. the paddock. Legend has it that [[King Edward VII]] started the trend of leaving the bottom button of a suit as well as waistcoat undone.&lt;ref name=&quot;dnb&quot;&gt;[[Colin Matthew|Matthew, H. C. G.]] (September 2004; online edition May 2006) [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/32975 &quot;Edward VII (1841–1910)&quot;], ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'', Oxford University Press, {{doi|10.1093/ref:odnb/32975}}, retrieved 24 June 2009 (Subscription required)&lt;/ref&gt;

When fastening a three-button suit, the middle button is fastened, and the top one sometimes, but the bottom is traditionally not designed to be (although in the past some jackets were cut so that it could be fastened without distorting the drape; this is not the case with current clothing). A four-button suit is untraditional and so has no traditional guidelines on buttoning, but the middle ones at least should be fastened. Additionally, the one button suit has regained some popularity (it is also one of the classic styles of [[Savile Row tailoring]]). The button should always be fastened while standing.

With a single-breasted suit, it is proper to have the buttons unfastened while sitting down to avoid an ugly drape. A good double-breasted suit is usually able to be left buttoned, to avoid the difficulty of constantly redoing inner buttons when standing up.

===Ties with suits===
{{Main|Necktie}}
Working with neckties is very much a matter of personal taste, but in conservative terms there are some basic guidelines.

'''Colour:''' Ties should always be darker than the wearer's shirt. The background colour of the tie should not be the same as that of the shirt, while the foreground of the tie should contain the colour of the shirt and thereby &quot;pick up&quot; on the colour of the shirt. Ideally, the tie should also integrate the colour of the suit in the same way. Generally, simple or subdued patterns are preferred for conservative dress, though these are terms with a wide range of interpretation. During the late 1990s and early 2000s, it became popular to match the necktie colour with the shirt (a &quot;monochromatic&quot; look popularised by TV personality [[Regis Philbin]]) or even wearing a lighter coloured tie with a darker shirt, usually during formal occasions. A light blue shirt with a blue tie that is darker in its colour is also common.

'''Knot:''' Some of the most common knots are the [[Four-in-hand knot|Four-in-hand]], the [[Half-Windsor knot|Half-Windsor]], the [[Windsor knot|Windsor]] (often called a Full-Windsor or Double-Windsor to distinguish it from the half-Windsor) and the [[Pratt knot|Shelby or Pratt]]. A Four-in-hand, Half-Windsor, or Windsor is generally the most appropriate with a suit, particularly by contemporary guidelines. Once properly knotted and arranged, the bottom of the tie can extend anywhere from the wearer's navel level, to slightly below the waistband. The thin end should not extend below the wide end, though this can occasionally be seen to be acceptable with thin ties.

'''Alternatives:''' In the 1960s, it was fashionable for men as well as women to wear [[scarves]] with a suit in a tied knot either inside a shirt as an [[ascot tie|Ascot]] or under the collar as would be worn like a tie.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}} This style began to fade by the mid-1970s and came back in the 1990s mainly for women. It did however make a small comeback by 2005 and some famous stars wear them. Although some wore scarves back in the 1960s, ties were still preferred among business workers.

'''Bow Ties:''' Bow ties have always provided an alternative to neckties, and even preceded the necktie. Bow ties are even regarded, arguably, as more formal or dressy than neckties, especially when worn with suits. During the &quot;powerdressing,&quot; or &quot;dress for success&quot; days of the 1980s, bow ties, though in the minority, certainly had their share of the business and professional fashion market. This included women professionals, who wore a slightly fuller version of the bow tie with the skirt suits and buttoned-up blouses popular in the business world. Bow ties, for professional men or women, typically were the same fabrics, colours, and patterns as neckties.

===Shirts with suits===
{{Main|Dress shirt}}

===Socks with suits===
In the United States it is common for [[sock]]s to match the trouser leg.&lt;ref&gt;Flusser (2002). p. 173&lt;/ref&gt; This makes the leg appear longer and minimises the attention drawn by a trouser leg tailored to be too short. A more general rule is for socks to be darker than the shade of the trousers, but potentially a different colour. With patterned socks, ideally the background colour of the sock should match the primary colour of the suit. If it is not possible to match the trouser leg, socks may match one's shoes. In particular, pale or even white socks might be worn with, for example, a cream linen suit with white shoes. {{Citation needed|date=April 2013}}

Socks are preferably{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} at least mid-calf height, if not knee-height (''over-the-calf''), and are usually made predominantly of cotton or wool, though luxury or dress socks may use more exotic blends such as silk and cashmere. Before [[World War II]], patterned socks were common, and a variety of designs like [[Argyle (pattern)|Argyle]] or contrasting socks was commonly seen. After WWII, socks became more subdued in colour. In lieu of over-the-calf length (which will stay up by itself), some men still use garters to hold up their socks, but this is unusual.

==Suit etiquette for women==
{{Unreferenced section|date=February 2011}}
[[File:Camino a la reunión con con el Presidente de la República Popular China, el Excmo. Sr. Xi Jinping. (8627337472).jpg|thumb|[[Angélica Rivera]] wearing a modern-day skirt suit]]
Suit-wearing etiquette for women generally follows the same guidelines used by men, with a few differences and more flexibility.

For women, the [[skirt]] suit or [[dress]] suit are both acceptable; a [[blouse]], which can be white or coloured, takes the place of a shirt. Women's suits can also be worn with coloured tops or T-shirts.

Women's suits come in a larger variety of colours such as darks, pastels, and gem colours.

Women generally do not wear neckties with their suits. Fancy silk [[scarf|scarves]] that resemble a floppy [[ascot tie]] became popular in [[North America]] in the 1970s. By the 1980s, women were entering the [[White-collar worker|white-collar]] workforce in increasing numbers and their dress fashions adopted looks not dissimilar from men's business wear. By the early to mid-1980s, conservatively-tailored skirt suits were the norm, in the same colours and fabrics considered standard in men's suits. These were typically worn with buttoned-up collared blouses, usually white or some pastel in colour. These were frequently accessorised with a version of the [[bow tie]], usually the same fabrics, colours, and patterns as men's neckties and bow ties, but tied in a fuller bow at the collar.

An '''office''' is generally a [[room (architecture)|room]] or other area where [[Business administration|administrative]] work is done, but may also denote a position within an [[organization]] with specific duties attached to it (see [[officer (disambiguation)|officer]], [[office-holder (disambiguation)|office-holder]], [[official]]); the latter is in fact an earlier usage, office as place originally referring to the location of one's duty. When used as an [[adjective]], the term &quot;office&quot; may refer to [[business]]-related tasks. In [[legal]] writing, a company or organization has offices in any place that it has an official presence, even if that presence consists of, for example, a [[storage silo]] rather than an office. An office is an architectural and design phenomenon; whether it is a small office such as a [[Bench (furniture)|bench]] in the corner of a [[small business]] of extremely small size (see [[small office/home office]]), through entire floors of buildings, up to and including massive buildings dedicated entirely to one company. In modern terms an office usually refers to the location where [[white-collar worker]]s are employed. As per [[James Stephenson]],&quot;Office is  that part of business enterprise which is devoted to the direction and co-ordination of its various activities.&quot;

Offices in classical antiquity were often part of a palace complex or a large temple. The [[High Middle Ages]] (1000–1300) saw the rise of the medieval [[Chancery (medieval office)|chancery]], which was usually the place where most government letters were written and where laws were copied in the administration of a kingdom. With the growth of large, complex organizations in the 18th century, the first purpose-built office spaces were constructed. As the [[Industrial Revolution]] intensified in the 18th and 19th centuries, the industries of [[bank]]ing, [[rail transport|rail]], [[insurance]], [[retail]], [[petroleum]], and [[telegraph]]y dramatically grew, and a large number of clerks were needed, and as a result more office space was required to house these activities. The [[time and motion study]], pioneered in manufacturing by [[F. W. Taylor]] led to the “Modern Efficiency Desk” with a flat top and drawers below, designed to allow managers an easy view of the workers. However, by the midpoint of the 20th century, it became apparent that an efficient office required discretion in the control of privacy, and gradually the [[cubicle]] system evolved.&lt;ref name=Long/&gt;

The main purpose of an office environment is to support its occupants in performing their job. Work spaces in an office are typically used for conventional office activities such as reading, writing and computer work. There are nine generic types of work space, each supporting different activities. In addition to individual cubicles, there are also meeting rooms, lounges, and spaces for support activities, such as photocopying and filing. Some offices also have a kitchen area where workers can make their lunches. There are many different ways of arranging the space in an office and whilst these vary according to function, managerial [[fashion]]s and the culture of specific companies can be even more important.  
While offices can be built in almost any location and in almost any building, some modern requirements for offices make this more difficult, such as requirements for light, networking, and security. The primary purpose of an office building is to provide a workplace and working environment primarily for administrative and managerial workers. These workers usually occupy set areas within the office building, and usually are provided with desks, PCs and other equipment they may need within these areas.

==History==
The structure and shape of the office is impacted by both management thought as well as construction materials and may or may not have walls or barriers. The word stems from the Latin [[Officium (Ancient Rome)|officium]], and its equivalents in various, mainly romance, languages.  An officium was not necessarily a place, but rather an often mobile 'bureau' in the sense of a human staff or even the abstract notion of a formal position, such as a magistrature. The relatively elaborate Roman bureaucracy would not be equaled for centuries in the West after the fall of [[Rome]], even partially reverting to illiteracy, while the East preserved a more sophisticated administrative culture, both under Byzantium and under Islam.

Offices in classical antiquity were often part of a palace complex or a large temple. There was usually a room where [[Scroll (parchment)|scroll]]s were kept and [[scribe]]s did their work. Ancient texts mentioning the work of scribes allude to the existence of such &quot;offices&quot;. These rooms are sometimes called &quot;libraries&quot; by some archaeologists and the general press because one often associates scrolls with literature. In fact they were true offices since the scrolls were meant for record keeping and other management functions such as treaties and edicts, and not for writing or keeping poetry or other works of fiction.

===Middle Ages===
The [[High Middle Ages]] (1000–1300) saw the rise of the medieval [[Chancery (medieval office)|chancery]], which was usually the place where most government letters were written and where laws were copied in the administration of a kingdom. The rooms of the chancery often had walls full of pigeonholes, constructed to hold rolled up pieces of parchment for safekeeping or ready reference, a precursor to the book shelf. The introduction of printing during the [[Renaissance]] did not change these early government offices much.

[[File:Office 1719.jpg|thumb|An early [[Europe]]an office]]

Medieval illustrations, such as paintings or tapestries, often show people in their private offices handling record-keeping books or writing on scrolls of [[parchment]]. All kinds of writings seemed to be mixed in these early forms of offices. Before the invention of the [[printing press]] and its distribution there was often a very thin line between a private office and a private [[library]] since books were read or written in the same space at the same [[desk]] or [[Table (furniture)|table]], and general accounting and personal or private letters were also done there.

It was during the 13th century that the English form of the word first appeared when referring to a position involving duties (ex. the office of the ...).  [[Geoffrey Chaucer]] appears to have first used the word in 1395 to mean a place where business is transacted in ''[[The Canterbury Tales]]''.

As [[mercantilism]] became the dominant economic theory of the [[Renaissance]], merchants tended to conduct their business in the same buildings, which might include retail sales, warehousing and clerical work.  During the 15th century, population density in many cities reached the point where stand-alone buildings were used by merchants to conduct their business, and there was a developing a distinction between church, government/military and commerce uses for buildings.&lt;ref name=Long&gt;{{cite book | last=Long | first=Kim | pages=14–16 | title=User Effective Buildings | location=Denver | publisher=Aardex Corporation | year=2004 | isbn=0975552406}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Emergence of the modern office===
With the growth of large, complex organizations such as the [[Royal Navy]] and the [[East India Company]] in the 18th century, the first purpose-built office spaces were constructed. The Old Admiralty ([[Ripley Building]]) was built in 1726 as a three storey U-shaped brick building and was the first purpose built office building in Great Britain. As well as offices, the building housed a board room and apartments for the Lords of the Admiralty. In the 1770s, many scattered offices for the [[Royal Navy]] were gathered into [[Somerset House]], the first block purpose-built for office work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8S4yyAkysYgC|title=The Making of the Modern Admiralty:British Naval Policy-Making, 1805-1927|author=Hamilton, C.I|year=2011|publisher=Cambridge University Press|page=15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:East India House by Thomas Malton the Younger.jpg|thumb|left|The sprawling complex of the extended [[East India House]] c.1800. The company employed an army of bureaucrats to administer its territories in India.]]

The [[East India House]] was built in 1729 on [[Leadenhall Street]] as the headquarters from which the East India Company administered its [[British Raj|Indian colonial possessions]]. The Company developed a very complex bureaucracy for the task, which required thousands of office employees to process the necessary paperwork. The Company recognized the benefits of centralized administration, and required that all workers sign in and out at the central office, daily.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-23372401|title=How the office was invented|publisher=BBC|accessdate=2012-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the [[Industrial Revolution]] intensified in the 18th and 19th centuries, the industries of [[bank]]ing, [[rail transport|rail]], [[insurance]], [[retail]], [[petroleum]], and [[telegraph]]y dramatically grew in size and complexity.  To transact business, an increasing large number of clerks were needed to handle order-processing, accounting, and document filing, with increasingly specialized office space required to house these activities. Most of the desks of the era were top heavy with paper storage bins extending above the desk-work area, giving the appearance of a cubicle and offering the workers some degree of privacy.

The relative high price of land in the central core of cities lead to the first multi-story buildings, which were limited to about 10 stories until the use of [[Cast-iron architecture|iron and steel]] allowed for higher structures. The first purpose-built office block was the Brunswick Building, built in [[Liverpool]] in 1841.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.liverpoolwiki.org/Liverpool_Firsts|title=Liverpool Firsts|accessdate=2012-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The invention of the safety [[Screw-drive elevator|elevator]] in 1852 by [[Elisha Otis]] saw the rapid escalation upward of buildings.&lt;ref name=Long/&gt; By the end of the 19th century, larger office buildings frequently contained large glass [[atrium (architecture)|atrium]]s to allow light into the complex and improve air circulation.

===20th century===
[[File:Office speaking tubes 1903.jpg|left|thumb|An office in 1903, equipped with [[speaking tube]]s]]

By 1906, [[Sears]], Roebuck and Co had opened their mail order and headquarters operation in a {{convert|3000000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} building in Chicago, at the time the largest building in the world.  The [[time and motion study]], pioneered in manufacturing by [[F. W. Taylor]] and later applied to the office environment by [[Frank Bunker Gilbreth|Frank]] and [[Lillian Moller Gilbreth|Lillian Gilbreth]], led to the idea that managers needed to play an active role in directing the work of subordinates in order to increase the efficiency of the workplace. F.W. Taylor advocated the use of large, open floor plans, and desks that faced supervisors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Psychology of the Office Space|url=http://appliedpsychologydegree.usc.edu/psychology-of-the-office-space/|website=University of Southern California Master of Science in Applied Psychology|accessdate=28 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, in 1915, the [[Equitable Life Insurance Company]] in New York City introduced the “Modern Efficiency Desk” with a flat top and drawers below, designed to allow managers an easy view of the workers.  This led to a demand for a large square footages per floor in buildings, and a return to the open spaces that were seen in pre–industrial revolution buildings.&lt;ref name=Long/&gt;

[[File:Photograph of the Division of Classification and Cataloging, 1937.tif|right|thumb|1937 image of the Division of Classification and Cataloging, [[National Archives]], [[United States]]]]

However, by the midpoint of the 20th century, it became apparent that an efficient office required discretion in the control of privacy, which is needed to combat tedium linked to poor productivity, and to encourage creativity.  In 1964, the [[Herman Miller (office equipment)]] company engaged [[Robert Propst (inventor)|Robert Propst]], a prolific industrial designer, who came up with the concept of the [[Action Office]] which later evolved into the [[cubicle]] office furniture system.&lt;ref name=Long/&gt;

==Office spaces==
The main purpose of an office environment is to support its occupants in performing their job—preferably at minimum cost and to maximum satisfaction. With different people performing different tasks and activities, however, it is not always easy to select the right office spaces. To aid decision-making in workplace and office design, one can distinguish three different types of office spaces: work spaces, meeting spaces and support spaces. For new, or developing businesses, remote satellite offices and project rooms, Serviced Offices can provide a simple solution and provide all of the former types of space.

===Work spaces===
Work spaces in an office are typically used for conventional office activities such as reading, writing and computer work. There are nine generic types of work space, each supporting different activities.

==Office structure==
[[File:TradeMe offices.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Open plan [[TradeMe]] offices, above [[NZX]], Wellington, New Zealand]]

There are many different ways of arranging the space in an office and whilst these vary according to function, managerial [[fashion]]s and the culture of specific companies can be even more important.  Choices include, how many people will work within the same room.  At one extreme, each individual worker will have their own room; at the other extreme a large '''[[open plan]]''' office can be made up of one main room with tens or hundreds of people working in the same space.  Open plan offices put multiple workers together in the same space, and some studies have shown that they can improve short term productivity, i.e. within a single [[software]] [[project]].  At the same time, the loss of privacy and security can increase the incidence of theft and loss of company secrets.  A type of compromise between open plan and individual rooms is provided by the [[Cubicle]] [[desk]], possibly made most famous by the [[Dilbert]] cartoon series, which solves visual privacy to some extent, but often fails on acoustic separation and security.  Most [[cubicle]]s also require the occupant to sit with their back towards anyone who might be approaching; workers in walled offices almost always try to position their normal work seats and desks so that they can see someone entering, and in some instances, install tiny mirrors on things such as computer monitors.

==Office buildings==&lt;!-- This section is linked from the redirect page &quot;Office building&quot;, linked from many articles --&gt;

[[File:Salinas Office.jpg|thumb|A small office building in [[Salinas, California]], [[United States]]]]
[[File:Sears Tower ss.jpg|thumb|The [[Willis Tower]] in [[Chicago]] is a high-rise office building, the tallest of its kind in the U.S.]]

While offices can be built in almost any location and in almost any building, some modern requirements for offices make this more difficult.  These requirements can be both legal (''e.g. light levels must be sufficient'') or technical (''e.g. requirements for computer networking'').  Alongside, other requirements such as security and flexibility of layout, has led to the creation of special [[building]]s which are dedicated only or primarily for use as offices. An '''office building''', also known as an '''office block''' or business center is a form of [[commercial building]] which contains spaces mainly designed to be used for offices.

The primary purpose of an office building is to provide a workplace and working environment primarily for administrative and managerial workers. These workers usually occupy set areas within the office building, and usually are provided with desks, PCs and other equipment they may need within these areas.

An office building will be divided into sections for different companies or may be dedicated to one company.  In either case, each company will typically have a reception area, one or several meeting rooms, singular or open-plan offices, as well as toilets.

Many office buildings also have kitchen facilities and a staff room, where workers can have lunch or take a short break. Many office spaces are now also [[serviced office]] spaces, which means that those occupying a space or building can share facilities.

==Office and retail rental rates==

Rental rates for office and retail space are typically quoted in terms of money per floor-area–time, usually money per floor-area per year or month. For example, the rate for a particular property may be $29 per square-foot per year ($29/s.f/yr) - $290 per square-meter–year ($290/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/a), and rates in the area could range $20–$50/s.f./yr ($200–$500/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;·a).

In many countries, rent is typically paid monthly even if usually discussed in terms of years.

Examples:
* A particular 2,000 s.f. space is priced at $15/s.f./yr = (2,000 s.f.) × ($15/s.f./a) / (12 mo/yr) = $2500/month
* A 200 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; space priced at $150/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;·a = (200 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) × ($150/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;·a) / (12 mo/a) = $2500/month

In a ''gross lease'', the rate quoted is an all-inclusive rate. One pays a set amount of rent per time and the landlord is responsible for all other expenses such as costs of utilities, taxes, insurance, maintenance, and repairs.

The ''triple net'' lease is one in which the tenant is liable for a share of various expenses such as property taxes, insurance, maintenance, utilities, climate control, repairs, janitorial services and landscaping.

Office rents in the United States are still recovering from the high vacancy rates that occurred in the wake of the 2008 depression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.baruch.cuny.edu/realestate/pdf/This-Recovery%20-Explained.pdf |title=This Recovery Explained |publisher=The Steven L. Newman Real Estate Institute |date=Spring 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Grading==
The [[Building Owners and Managers Association]] (BOMA) classifies office space into three categories: Class A, Class B, and Class C.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author=Kennedy Smith | title=Categorization of office space is flexible | url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4185/is_20060630/ai_n16516895/ | work=St. Louis Daily Record &amp; St. Louis Countian | date=30 June 2006  | accessdate=9 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to BOMA, Class A office buildings  have the &quot;most prestigious buildings competing for premier office users with rents above average for the area&quot;. BOMA states that Class A facilities have &quot;high quality standard finishes, state of the art systems, exceptional accessibility and a definite market presence&quot;. BOMA describes Class B office buildings as those that compete &quot;for a wide range of users with rents in the average range for the area&quot;. BOMA states that Class B buildings have &quot;adequate systems&quot; and finishes that &quot;are fair to good for the area&quot;, but that the buildings do not compete with Class A buildings for the same prices. According to BOMA Class C buildings are aimed towards &quot;tenants requiring functional space at rents below the average for the area&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boma.org/research/Pages/building-class-definitions.aspx|accessdate=18 July 2013|title=Building Class Definitions}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The lack of specifics allows considerable room for &quot;fudging&quot; the boundaries of the categories.

In the history of Indian clothing the sari is traced back to the [[Indus Valley Civilisation]], which flourished during 2800–1800 BC around the western part of the [[Indian subcontinent]].&lt;ref name=&quot;alkazi&quot;&gt;Alkazi, Roshan (1983) &quot;Ancient Indian costume&quot;, Art Heritage&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Boulanger&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Ghurye&quot;&gt;Ghurye (1951) &quot;Indian costume&quot;, Popular book depot (Bombay); (Includes rare photographs of 19th century Namboothiri and nair women in ancient saree with bare upper torso)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cotton]] was first cultivated and woven in [[Indian subcontinent]] around 5th millinim BC.&lt;ref&gt;Stein, Burton (1998).

Early [[Sanskrit]] literature has a wide vocabulary of terms for the veiling used by women, such as ''Avagunthana'' (oguntheti/oguṇthikā), meaning cloak-veil, ''Uttariya'' meaning shoulder-veil, ''Mukha-pata'' meaning face-veil and ''Sirovas-tra'' meaning head-veil.&lt;ref&gt;Govind Sadashiv Ghurye (1951) &quot;Indian Costume.&quot;, p.236&lt;/ref&gt; In the ''Pratimānātaka'', a play by Bhāsa describes in context of ''Avagunthana'' veil that &quot;''ladies may be seen without any blame (for the parties concerned) in a religious session, in marriage festivities, during a calamity and in a forest''&quot;. &lt;ref&gt;Govind Sadashiv Ghurye (1951) &quot;Indian Costume.&quot;, p.236&lt;/ref&gt; The same sentiment is more generically expressed in later [[Sanskrit]] literature.&lt;ref&gt;Sulochana Ayyar (1987) &quot;Costumes and Ornaments as Depicted in the Sculptures of Gwalior Museum.&quot;, p.152&lt;/ref&gt; [[Śūdraka]], the author of  [[Mṛcchakatika]] set in fifth century BC says that the ''Avagaunthaha'' was not used by women everyday and at every time. He says that a married lady was expected to put on a vile while moving in the public.&lt;ref&gt;Sulochana Ayyar (1987) &quot;Costumes and Ornaments as Depicted in the Sculptures of Gwalior Museum.&quot;, p.152&lt;/ref&gt; This may indicate that it was not necessary for unmarried females to put on a veil. &lt;ref&gt;Sulochana Ayyar (1987) &quot;Costumes and Ornaments as Depicted in the Sculptures of Gwalior Museum.&quot;, p.152&lt;/ref&gt; In 3rd century CE, [[Mahayana]] Buddhists attempt to counter this growing [[Ghoonghat|veiling practice]] (oguntheti/oguṇthikā) in Lalitavistara Sūtra.&lt;ref&gt;Betty Kelen 1967 &quot;Gautama Buddha: In Life and Legend&quot; chapter 1, p. 7 and 8&lt;/ref&gt; This form of veiling by married women is still prevalent in Hindi-speaking areas, and is known as [[Ghoonghat]] where the loose end of a sari is pulled over the head to act as a [[Ghoonghat|facial veil]].&lt;ref&gt;Kusumanjali Prakashan, 1993 &quot;The Natyasastra tradition and ancient Indian society&quot;, p.63&lt;/ref&gt;

There are more than 80 recorded ways to wear a sari.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Anita Rao Kashi|title=How to Wear a Sari in India|url=http://www.worldhum.com/features/how-to/wear_a_sari_20071025/|publisher=World Hum|accessdate=18 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Indian Sari Comes West to American Women|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=mvchAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=hqEFAAAAIBAJ&amp;dq=midriff%20sari&amp;pg=3456%2C92338|accessdate=20 March 2012|newspaper=Palm Beach Daily News|date=9 November 1964}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most common style is for the sari to be wrapped around the waist, with the loose end of the drape to be worn over the shoulder, baring the midriff.&lt;ref name=&quot;alkazi&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Boulanger&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Ghurye&quot; /&gt; However, the sari can be draped in several different styles, though some styles do require a sari of a particular length or form. The French cultural [[Anthropology|anthropologist]] and sari researcher [[Chantal Boulanger]] categorised sari drapes in the following families:&lt;ref name=&quot;Boulanger&quot;&gt;Boulanger, Chantal; (1997) ''Saris: An Illustrated Guide to the Indian Art of Draping'', Shakti Press International, New York.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Nivi – styles originally worn in [[Andhra Pradesh]]; besides the modern nivi, there is also the ''kaccha nivi'', where the pleats are passed through the legs and tucked into the waist at the back. This allows free movement while covering the legs.
* [[Bengali people|Bengali]] and [[Odia people|Odia]] style is worn without any pleats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.eslarrenterprise.co.in/blog/ladies-fashion-garments/sarees/regional-styles-of-wearing-a-sari-by-indian-women/|title= Regional Styles of Wearing A Sari By Indian Women}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Gujarati people|Gujarati]]/[[Rajasthani language|Rajasthani]]/[[Pakistani language|Pakistani]] – after tucking in the pleats similar to the nivi style, the loose end is taken from the back, draped across the right shoulder, and pulled across to be secured in the back
* [[Nepal|Nepali]] - Nepali sari is worn in various forms of traditional nivi style, saris are worn with nepali blouse known as [[choli|cholo]].
* [[Maharashtra|Maharashtrian]]/[[Konkani language|Konkani]]/Kashta; this drape is very similar to that of the male Maharashtrian [[dhoti]],though there are many regional and societal variations. The centre of the sari (held lengthwise) is placed at the centre back, the ends are brought forward and tied securely, then the two ends are wrapped around the legs. When worn as a sari, an extra-long cloth of nine yards is used and the ends are then passed up over the shoulders and the upper body. The style worn by [[Brahmin]] women of differs from that of the [[Maratha]]s.The style also differs from community to community.This style is popular in [[Maharashtra]],[[Goa]],parts of [[Karnataka]].
* [[Madisar]] – this drape is typical of Iyengar/Iyer Brahmin ladies from Tamil Nadu. Traditional Madisar is worn using 9 yards saree.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tamilnadu.com/fashion/madisar-pudavai.html |title=Madisar Pudavai|publisher=Tamilnadu.com|date=5 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Kodagu district|Kodagu]] style – this drape is confined to ladies hailing from the [[Kodagu]] district of [[Karnataka]]. In this style, the pleats are created in the rear, instead of the front. The loose end of the sari is draped back-to-front over the right shoulder, and is pinned to the rest of the sari.
* ''Gobbe Seere'' – This style is worn by women in the Malnad or Sahyadri and central region of Karnataka.  It is worn with 18 molas saree with three four rounds at the waist and a knot after crisscrossing over shoulders.
* [[Assam|Assamese]] – This sari style is three-set garment known ''[[Mekhela chador]]''. The bottom portion, draped from the waist downwards is called ''Mekhela'' and veil is known as ''Chadar'' and is worn with long sleeve [[choli]].
* [[Manipur|Manipuri]] - This sari style is also worn with three-set garment known as ''Innaphi'' viel, ''Phanek'' lower wrap and long sleeved [[choli]].
* [[Meghalaya|Khasi]] - Khasi style of sari is known as ''Jainsem'' which is made up of several pieces of cloth, giving the body a cylindrical shape. 
* [[Kerala|Malayali]] style – the two-piece sari, or [[Kerala sari|Mundum Neryathum]], worn in [[Kerala]]. Usually made of unbleached cotton and decorated with gold or coloured stripes and/or borders. Also the [[Kerala sari]], a sort of mundum neryathum.
* Tribal styles – often secured by tying them firmly across the chest, covering the breasts.
* Kunbi style or ''denthli'':Goan [[Gauda and Kunbi]]s,and those of them who have migrated to other states use this way of draping Sari or ''Kappad'',this form of draping is created by tying a knot in the fabric below the shoulder and a strip of cloth which crossed the left shoulder was fasten on the back.&lt;ref name=kunbi&gt;{{cite news |last=Sikka |first=Raghav |title=Wendell Rodricks showcase |url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/fashion-and-trends/wendell-rodricks-showcases-colours-of-goa/story-q4v0nmamOOwfkDDitMq6tK.html |newspaper=Hindustan Times |location=New Delhi |accessdate=25 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nivi style===
[[File:Maharani Ourmilla Of Jubbal.jpg|thumb|180px|right|Maharani Ourmilla Devi Of Jubbal in Nivi Sari]]

The nivi is today's most popular sari style from [[Andhra Pradesh]]. The increased interaction with the British saw most women from royal families come out of purdah in the 1900s. This necessitated a change of dress. Maharani [[Indira Devi]] of Cooch Behar popularised the [[chiffon (fabric)|chiffon]] sari. She was widowed early in life and followed the convention of abandoning her richly woven Baroda shalus in favour of the unadorned [[mourning]] white as per tradition. Characteristically, she transformed her &quot;[[mourning]]&quot; clothes into high fashion. She had saris woven in France to her personal specifications, in white chiffon, and introduced the silk chiffon sari to the royal fashion repertoire.&lt;ref name=&quot;A story of sartorial amalgamation&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.india-seminar.com/2008/585/585_ritu_kumar.htm/|title= A story of sartorial amalgamation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The chiffon sari did what years of fashion interaction had not done in India. It homogenised fashion across this land. Its softness, lightness and beautiful, elegant, caressing drape was ideally suited to the Indian climate. Different courts adopted their own styles of draping and indigenising the sari. In most of the courts the sari was embellished with stitching hand-woven borders in goldfrom Varanasi, delicate zardozi work, gota, makaish and tilla work that embellished the plain fabric, simultaneously satisfying both traditional demands and ingrained love for ornamentation. Some images of maharanis in the Deccan show the women wearing a sleeveless, richly embellished waistcoat over their blouses. The Begum of Savanur remembers how sumptuous the chiffon sari became at their gatherings. At some courts it was worn with jaali, or net kurtas and embossed silk waist length sadris or jackets. Some of them were so rich that the entire ground was embroidered over with pearls and zardozi.&lt;ref name=&quot;A story of sartorial amalgamation&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.theluxecafe.com/fashion/clothes-accessories/royal-style-diaries-for-the-princess-in-you/&lt;/ref&gt;

Nivi drape starts with one end of the sari tucked into the [[waistband]] of the [[petticoat]], usually a plain [[skirt]]. The cloth is wrapped around the lower body once, then hand-gathered into even pleats below the navel. The pleats are tucked into the waistband of the petticoat.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dongerkerry&quot;&gt;Dongerkerry, Kamala, S. (1959) ''The Indian sari''. New Delhi.&lt;/ref&gt; They create a graceful, decorative effect which poets have likened to the petals of a flower.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dongerkerry&quot;/&gt; After one more turn around the waist, the loose end is draped over the shoulder.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dongerkerry&quot;/&gt; The loose end is called the pallu, pallav, seragu, or paita depending on the language. It is draped diagonally in front of the torso. It is worn across the right hip to over the left shoulder, partly baring the midriff.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dongerkerry&quot;/&gt; The navel can be revealed or concealed by the wearer by adjusting the pallu, depending on the social setting. The long end of the pallu hanging from the back of the shoulder is often intricately decorated. The pallu may be hanging freely, tucked in at the waist, used to cover the head, or used to cover the neck, by draping it across the right shoulder as well. Some nivi styles are worn with the pallu draped from the back towards the front, coming from the back over the right shoulder with one corner tucked by the left hip, covering the torso/waist. The nivi sari was popularised through the paintings of [[Raja Ravi Varma]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Miller&quot;&gt;Miller, Daniel &amp; Banerjee, Mukulika, ''The Sari'' (2004), Lustre press / Roli books.&lt;/ref&gt; In one of his paintings, the Indian subcontinent was shown as a mother wearing a flowing nivi sari.&lt;ref name=&quot;Miller&quot;/&gt; The ornaments generally accepted by the Hindu culture that can be worn in the midriff region are the [[waist chain]]s. They are considered to be a part of bridal jewellery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FOoCAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA127&amp;dq=waist+chain+sari&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=975uTo-dD9PG0AHD4MWACg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CDoQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=sari%20chains&amp;f=false |title=Indianapolis Monthly – Jun 2004 |publisher=Google Books |accessdate=13 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Professional style of draping===
[[File:Gandhisonia04052007.jpg|thumb|[[Sonia Gandhi]] in a professional sari with extended blouse.]]
Because of the harsh extremes in temperature on the Indian Subcontinent, the sari fills a practical role as well as a decorative one. It is not only warming in winter and cooling in summer, but its loose-fitting tailoring is preferred by women who must be free to move as their duties require. For this reason, it is the clothing of choice of [[Flight attendant|air hostesses]] on [[Air India]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Air India&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url = http://deeplythinking.wordpress.com/2011/06/15/air-india-sare | title = Air India}}&lt;/ref&gt; This led to a professional style of draping a sari which is referred to &quot;Air-Hostess style sari&quot;. An air hostess style sari is tied in just the same way as a normal sari except that the pleats are held together quite nicely with the help of pins. A bordered sari will be just perfect for an Air-Hostess style drape where the pallu is heavily pleated and pinned on the shoulder. Even the vertical pleats that are tucked at the navel are severely pleated and pressed. Same goes for the pallu pleats that are pinned at the shoulder. To get the perfect &quot;Air-hostess&quot; a complimentary U-shaped blouse that covers the upper body completely is worn which gives a very elegant and formal look. Mastering the &quot;Air-hostess&quot; style drape helps to create the desired impact in a formal setting like an interview or a conference.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sareez.wordpress.com/2011/02/20/handy-tips-to-wear-a-saree-air-hostess-style/ |title=Handy tips to wear a saree 'Air-hostess' style! |publisher=Sareez.wordpress.com |accessdate=13 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.utsavfashion.in/ |title=Airhostess Saree Draping at Utsav Fashion |publisher=Utsavfashion.in |accessdate=13 November 2011 |date=June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Saris are worn as uniforms by the female [[Concierge|hotel staff]] of many five star luxury hotels in India as symbol of culture. Recently, in a makeover design, [[Taj Hotels Resorts and Palaces]], decided the welcoming staff at the group's Luxury Hotels would be draped in the rich colours and designs of the [[Banarasi]] six yards. The new saris were unveiled at the Taj property in Mumbai. It will be subsequently replicated at all 10 Luxury Hotels of the group across the country for duty managers and front office staff. Taj had adopted three villages in Varanasi and employed 25 master weavers there for the project. The vision finally took shape after 14 months, once the weavers had a good work environment, understood the designs and fine-tuned the motifs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rediff.com/money/2008/apr/17taj.htm |title=Now Banarasi sarees for Taj staff |publisher=Rediff.com |accessdate=13 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tata.com/ourcommitment/articles/inside.aspx?artid=/1gZ8FEhnhM |title=Weaving a new life |publisher=Tata.com |date=31 January 2009 |accessdate=13 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dnaindia.com/mumbai/report_taj-group-staff-gets-new-uniforms_1547551 |title=Taj Group staff gets new uniforms |publisher=dnaindia.com |date=26 May 2011 |accessdate=13 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hospitalitybizindia.com/detailNews.aspx?aid=2439&amp;sid=1 |title=Taj Hotels &amp; Resorts introduces new uniforms, Engages Varanasi's master-weavers |publisher=hospitalitybizindia.com |date=25 October 2008 |accessdate=13 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/news-by-industry/services/hotels-/-restaurants/taj-hotel-staff-to-wear-varanasi-sarees-as-unform/articleshow/2949287.cms |title=Taj Hotel staff to wear Varanasi sarees as uniform – The Economic Times |publisher=Economictimes.indiatimes.com |date=13 April 2008 |accessdate=13 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hindu.com/2008/08/02/stories/2008080259650400.htm |title=Poised to win |work=The Hindu |location=India |date=2 August 2008 |accessdate=13 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, the female politicians of India wear the sari in a professional manner. The women of [[Nehru–Gandhi family]] like [[Indira Gandhi]] and [[Sonia Gandhi]] wear the special blouse for the campaign trail which is longer than usually and is tucked in to prevent any midriff show while waving to the crowds.Stylist [[Prasad Bidapa]] has to say, &quot;I think Sonia Gandhi is the country's most stylish politician. But that's because she's inherited the best collection of saris from her mother-in-law. I'm also happy that she supports the Indian handloom industry with her selection.&quot; [[Bharatiya Janata Party|BJP]] politician [[Sushma Swaraj]] maintains her prim housewife look with a pinned-up pallu while general secretary of [[All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam|AIADMK]] [[Jayalalithaa]] wears her saris like a suit of armour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Akanksha Swarup &amp; Soni Sangwan |title=Sari secrets of politicians! |url=http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/Sari+secrets+of+politicians!/1/37857.html |accessdate=20 March 2012 |newspaper=India Today |date=20 April 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/20111024134946/http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/Sari+secrets+of+politicians!/1/37857.html |archivedate=24 October 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bangladesh==
[[File:Russia-Bangladeshi talks Moscow 2013-01-15 05.jpeg|thumb|[[Prime Minister of Bangladesh|Bangladeshi Prime Minister]] [[Sheikh Hasina]] in a [[Rajshahi silk]] sari at the [[Moscow Kremlin]] in 2013]]
Sharee or saree (in Bengali=শাড়ি, Śāṛi ) is the national wear of [[Bangladeshi]] women. Most women who are married wear sharee as their regular dress while young-unmarried girls wear sharee as an occasional dress.
The ''shari'' is worn by women throughout Bangladesh. Sari is the most popular dress for [[women in Bangladesh]], both for casual and formal occasion. Although [[Jamdani|Dhakai Jamdani]] (hand made shari) is worldwide known and most famous to all women who wear shari but there are also many variety of shari in Bangladesh.There are many regional variations of them in both silk and cotton. e.g.- Tanta/Tant cotton shari, [[Dhakai]] [[Banarasi sari]], [[Rajshahi silk]], [[Tangail]] [[Tant saree]], [[Tassar silk]] shari, [[Manipur]]i shari and Katan shari are the most popular in Bangladesh.

==Pakistan==
In Pakistan, the [[saree]]s are still popular and worn on special occasions. The [[Shalwar kameez]], however, is worn throughout the country on a daily basis. The sari nevertheless remains a popular garment among the middle and upper class for many formal functions. Sarees can be seen worn commonly in metropolitan cities such as Karachi and Islamabad and are worn regularly to weddings and other business type of functions. Sarees are also worn by many [[Muslim]] women in Sindh to show their status or to enhance their beauty.

==Sri Lanka==
Sri Lankan women wear saris in many styles. Two ways of draping the sari are popular and tend to dominate: the Indian style (classic nivi drape) and the Kandyan style (or ''osaria'' in Sinhalese). The Kandyan style is generally more popular in the hill country region of Kandy from which the style gets its name. Though local preferences play a role, most women decide on style depending on personal preference or what is perceived to be most flattering for their figure.

The traditional Kandyan (osaria) style consists of a full blouse which covers the midriff completely and is partially tucked in at the front as is seen in this 19th-century portrait. However, modern intermingling of styles has led to most wearers baring the midriff. The final tail of the sari is neatly pleated rather than free-flowing. This is rather similar to the pleated rosette used in the Dravidian style noted earlier in the article.

The Kandyan style is considered the national dress of Sinhalese women. It is the uniform of the air hostesses of [[SriLankan Airlines]].

During the 1960s, the mini sari known as 'hipster' sari created a wrinkle in Sri Lankan fashion, since it was worn below the navel and barely above the line of prosecution for indecent exposure. The conservative people described the 'hipster' as &quot;''an absolute travesty of a beautiful costume almost a desecration''&quot; and &quot;''a hideous and purposeless garment''&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Minisaree causes uproar in Ceylon|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=0uRGAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=_f0MAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3053,1859967&amp;dq=navel+saree&amp;hl=en|accessdate=13 March 2012|newspaper=Gadsden Times|date=11 July 1969}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Eastern Miniskirt causes considerable uproar|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1955&amp;dat=19690706&amp;id=-sgtAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=daAFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6108,2596939|accessdate=13 March 2012|newspaper=Reading Eagle|date=6 July 1969}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nepal==

The sari is the most commonly worn women's clothing in Nepal. In Nepal, a special style of sari draping is called ''haku patasihh''. The sari is draped around the waist and a shawl is worn covering the upper half of the sari, which is used in place of a ''pallu''.

==Similarities and differences with other Asian clothing==

While the sari is typical to Indian traditional wear, clothing worn by [[South-East Asian]] countries like [[Burma]], [[Malaysia]], [[Philippines]], and Singapore resemble it, where a long rectangular piece of cloth is draped around the body. These are different from the sari as they are wrapped around the lower-half of body as a skirt, worn with a shirt/blouse, resembling a [[sarong]], as seen in the Burmese [[Longyi]], [[Filipino people|Filipino]] [[Malong]], [[Tapis (Philippine clothing)|Tapis]], [[Lao people|Laotian]] [[Xout lao]], [[Thai people|Thai]] [[Sinh]]'s, and [[Timor]]ese [[Tais]].  Saris, worn predominantly in India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, and Nepal are usually draped with one end of the cloth fastened around the waist, and the other end placed over the shoulder baring the midriff.&lt;ref name=&quot;alkazi&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Boulanger&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Ghurye&quot;/&gt;

==Saree ornamentation and decorative accessories==
[[File:Whitechapel dresses 1.jpg|thumb|Display of traditional sarees with [[Gota (embroidery)|gota patti]] embroidery for festive occasions at clothing store.]] 
Saris are woven with one plain end (the end that is concealed inside the wrap), two long decorative borders running the length of the sari, and a one to three-foot section at the other end which continues and elaborates the length-wise decoration. This end is called the ''pallu''; it is the part thrown over the shoulder in the nivi style of draping.

In past times, saris were woven of [[Silk in the Indian subcontinent|silk]] or cotton. The rich could afford finely woven, [[Transparency and translucency|diaphanous]] silk saris that, according to [[folklore]], could be passed through a [[finger ring]]. The poor wore coarsely woven cotton saris. All saris were [[weaving|handwoven]] and represented a considerable investment of time or money.

Simple hand-woven villagers' saris are often decorated with checks or stripes woven into the cloth. Inexpensive saris were also decorated with [[block printing]] using carved wooden blocks and vegetable dyes, or [[tie-dye]]ing, known in India as ''bhandani'' work.

More expensive saris had elaborate geometric, floral, or figurative ornaments or brocades created on the [[Loom#Handloom|loom]], as part of the fabric. Sometimes warp and weft threads were tie-dyed and then woven, creating ''[[ikat]]'' patterns. Sometimes threads of different colours were woven into the base fabric in patterns; an ornamented border, an elaborate pallu, and often, small repeated accents in the cloth itself. These accents are called ''buttis'' or ''bhuttis'' (spellings vary). For fancy saris, these patterns could be woven with [[Gold thread|gold or silver thread]], which is called ''[[zari]]'' work.
[[File:WLA haa Gold belt Tamil Oddiyanam 3.jpg|thumb|''Vaddanam'' or ''Kamarband'' is type of sari belt used to keep complex drapes in place.]] 
Sometimes the saris were further decorated, after weaving, with various sorts of embroidery. ''Resham'' work is embroidery done with coloured silk thread. ''[[Zardozi]]'' embroidery uses gold and silver thread, and sometimes pearls and [[Gemstone|precious stones]]. Cheap modern versions of ''zardozi'' use synthetic metallic thread and [[Fake minerals|imitation stones]], such as fake pearls and [[Swarovski]] crystals.

In modern times, saris are increasingly woven on mechanical looms and made of artificial fibres, such as [[polyester]], nylon, or [[rayon]], which do not require starching or [[ironing]]. They are printed by machine, or woven in simple patterns made with ''floats'' across the back of the sari. This can create an elaborate appearance on the front, while looking ugly on the back. The ''punchra'' work is imitated with inexpensive machine-made tassel trim. Fashion designer [[Aaditya Sharma]] declared, &quot;I can drape a sari in 54 different styles&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Davina Raisinghani|title=Sari, it's a wrap|url=http://www.khaleejtimes.com/article/20090112/ARTICLE/301129953/1057|accessdate=20 March 2012|newspaper=Khaleej Times Online|date=12 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hand-woven, hand-decorated saris are naturally much more expensive than the machine imitations. While the overall market for handweaving has plummeted (leading to much distress among Indian handweavers), [[weaving|hand-woven]] saris are still popular for weddings and other grand social occasions.

==Sari outside South Asia==
[[File:Aishwarya bachchan.jpg|thumb|Aishwarya bachchan in a sari at the London premiere of her film [[Raavan]].]]
The traditional sari made an impact in the United States during the 1970s. Eugene Novack who ran the New York store, Royal Saree House told that he had been selling it mainly to the Indian women in New York area but later many American business women and housewives became his customers who preferred their saris to resemble the full gown of the western world.

As a nod to the fashion-forward philosophy established by the designs of [[Emilio Pucci]], the now-defunct [[Braniff International Airways]] envisioned their air hostesses wearing a more revealing version of a sari on a proposed Dallas-Bombay (conceivably via London) service in the late 1970s.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}  However this was never realised because of [[Halston]]'s resistance to working with a palette outside of his comfort zone.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}} The former Eagan, Minnesota–based [[Northwest Airlines]] considered issuing saris to flight attendants working the Minneapolis-Amsterdam-Delhi route that began in the 1990s. This never occurred largely because of a union dispute.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}

The sari has gained its popularity internationally because of the growth of Indian fashion trends globally. Many [[Bollywood]] celebrities, like [[Aishwarya Rai]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indianexpress.com/news/ravans-starstudded-premiere-in-london/634901/ |title=&quot;Ravan's star-studded premiere in London,&quot; ''The Indian Express'' |work=The Indian Express |location=India |date=17 June 2010 |accessdate=13 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; have worn it at international events representing the Indian culture. In 2010, Bollywood actress [[Deepika Padukone]] wanted to represent her country at an international event, wearing the national costume. On her very first red carpet appearance at the [[Cannes Film Festival|Cannes International Film Festival]], she stepped out on the red carpet in a [[Rohit Bal]] sari.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=PTI |url=http://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/fashion/article430034.ece |title=&quot;Deepika walks Cannes red carpet in saree,&quot; ''The Hindu'' |work=The Hindu |location=India |date=14 May 2010 |accessdate=13 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://movies.ndtv.com/movie_story.aspx?from=bottomrelated&amp;ID=ENTEN20100141422&amp;Keyword=bollywood |title=Deepika always wanted to wear saree at international do |publisher=Movies.ndtv.com |accessdate=13 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types==
While an international image of the modern style sari may have been popularised by airline [[stewardesses]], each region in the [[Indian subcontinent]] has developed, over the centuries, its own unique sari style.

A '''kurta''' ({{lang-ur|{{Nastaliq|كُرتا}}}},{{lang-hi|कुर्ता}},{{lang-bn|পাঞ্জাবী}}, {{lang-pa|ਕੁੜਤਾ}}, {{IPA-hns|ˈkʊrt̪aː|pron}}) is an upper garment for men and women, originating in [[South Asia]], with regional variations of form.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=qYK1AAAAIAAJ&amp;q=kurta+royal+costumes&amp;dq=kurta+royal+costumes&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=eU13VYeKLYXpUpq3gcAH&amp;ved=0CDMQ6AEwAA Kumar, Ritu (2006) Costumes and textiles of royal India]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Etymology ==
The word ''kurta'' is a borrowing from [[Hindustani language|Urdu, Hindustani]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.m-w.com/dictionary/kurta Merriam Webster: Kurta]&lt;/ref&gt; originally from either [[Sanskrit language|Sanskrit]] ''kuratu/kurtaka''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Ghurye|first= Govind|date= 1966|title= Indian Costume|url= https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=irh9dvlLz3MC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PR5&amp;dq=Govind+Sadashiv+Ghurye&amp;ots=CkYvdJCPuS&amp;sig=H7d9IecK9F2nMZ8FDJsJO-Fw2sQ|location= Mumbai|publisher= Popular Prakashan|page= 118|isbn= 81-7154-403-7|quote= &quot;A Chinese dictionary of the latter half of the 8th century A.D. lists 'kuratu' as the Sanskrit equivalent 
of a Chinese word which means skirt. And Al-Biruni later noted that females in North India wore 'kurtaka',
which was a short skirt extending from the shoulders to the middle of the body and had sleeves.&quot;|access-date= 2015-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[Persian language|Persian]] (literally, &quot;a collarless shirt&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;McGregor, R.

The straight cut kurta was adopted during 1930s - 1940s but is only worn by certain men on certain occasions. [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=QqIzh1StFiwC&amp;pg=PA136&amp;dq=sri+lankan+traditional+kurta&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CCMQ6AEwAWoVChMIi_-884qLxgIVCr8UCh0lpgBq#v=onepage&amp;q=%20kurta&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt; The kurta is worn with a [[Dhoti]], [[Paijama]], [[Shalwar]], [[lungi]] or [[jeans]]. The kurta is similar to the [[Perahan tunban|perahan]] worn in [[Afghanistan]], the [[phiran]] of [[Kashmir]] and the [[Daura-Suruwal|daura]] of [[Nepal]].

==Styles==
The straight cut kurta is a loose shirt falling either just above or somewhere below the knees of the wearer, and is traditionally worn by men. However, women do also wear the straight cut kurta or its shorter version, the [[kurti top|kurti]]. They were traditionally worn with loose-fitting [[paijama]] (''kurta-paijama''), loose-fitting [[shalwar]]s, semi-tight (loose from the waist to the knees, and tight from the calves to the ankles) [[churidar]]s, or wrapped-around [[dhoti]]s;&lt;ref name=OED89/&gt; but are now also worn with [[jeans]].&lt;ref name=kurtis-jeans&gt;[http://www.telegraphindia.com/1040417/asp/calcutta/story_3131072.asp &quot;Regal chic&quot;], ''The Telegraph''k, [[Calcutta]], April 24, 2004.  Quote: &quot;The first sequence was a range of traditional saris in silk and cotton, moving on to kurtis and jeans and short kurtas in silk and georgette.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;   Kurtas are worn both as casual everyday wear and as formal dress.

Imported straight cut kurtas were fashionable in the United States in the 1960s and 1970s, as an element of [[hippie]] fashion, fell from favor briefly, and are now again fashionable. [[South Asian]] women may also wear this Western adaptation of South Asian fashion.

Some styles, button or are tied at the shoulder seam and have [[placket]]s rather than slits. The opening may be centered on the chest, or positioned off center.

Traditional forms of kurta do not have collar. Modern variants may feature stand-up collars of the type known to tailors and seamstresses as &quot;mandarin&quot; collars. These are the same sort of collars seen on [[achkan]]s, [[sherwani]]s, and [[Nehru jacket]]s.

The cut is usually simple, although decorative treatments can be elaborate.

The sleeves of a traditional kurta fall straight to the wrist; they do not narrow, as do many Western-cut sleeves.  Sleeves are not cuffed, just hemmed and decorated.

The front and back pieces of a simple kurta are also rectangular. The side seams are left open for 6-12&amp;nbsp;inches above the hem, which gives the wearer some ease of movement.

The kurta usually opens in the front and the front opening is often a hemmed slit in the fabric, buttoned at the top. The traditional straight cut kurta does not have a collar but modern versions do.

The use of side slits in the straight cut kurta can be traced to the 11th century C.E.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=irh9dvlLz3MC&amp;pg=PA118&amp;dq=kurtaka+dress&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=1laGVZziN8yBUfWDgOAD&amp;ved=0CEgQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=kurtaka%20dress&amp;f=false Ghurye, Govind Sadashiv (1966)  Indian Costume]&lt;/ref&gt; female kurtaka worn in parts of north India and was a short shirt, with sleeves extending from the shoulders, to the middle of the body, and had slashes on the left and the right sides.&lt;ref&gt;Yadava,Ganga Prasad  (1982) Dhanapāla and His Times: A Socio-cultural Study Based Upon His Works  [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=aY_I3zgxfpsC&amp;pg=PA107&amp;dq=kurtaka+dress&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=1laGVZziN8yBUfWDgOAD&amp;ved=0CDUQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=kurtaka%20dress&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt; This is the same as the modern straight cut kurta which has side slits and worn by women in Punjab.&lt;ref&gt;Sharma, Brij Narain  (1966) Social life in Northern India, A.D. 600-1000 [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=G0oiAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=kurtaka+punjab&amp;dq=kurtaka+punjab&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=OR-HVbCHCsPTU4O8JQ&amp;ved=0CCQQ6AEwAQ]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Jeans and straight cut kurta====
Kurtas are often worn with [[jeans]].&lt;ref name=kurtis-jeans /&gt; Women sometimes wear kurtas as [[blouse]]s, usually over [[jeans pant]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[Yet, jeans are among the most comfortable outfits as they can go with just about anything, a short top or even a kurta.]&lt;/ref&gt; Jeans are sometimes preferred over [[pajamas]] or [[leggings]] as they are more durable for rough use. Most colours kurtas match with blue jeans.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.deccanherald.com/content/113573/comfort-dressing-their-mantra.html]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, an Indian family court in [[Mumbai]] ruled that a husband objecting to his wife wearing a kurta and jeans and forcing her to wear a [[sari]] amounts to cruelty inflicted by the husband and can be a ground to seek divorce.&lt;ref name=&quot;gulfnews1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author=PTI |url=http://gulfnews.com/news/asia/india/wife-s-jeans-ban-is-grounds-for-divorce-india-court-rules-1.1353273 |title=Wife's jeans ban is grounds for divorce, India court rules |publisher=GulfNews.com |date=2014-06-28 |accessdate=2015-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The wife was thus granted a divorce on the ground of cruelty as defined under section 27(1)(d) of Special Marriage Act, 1954.&lt;ref name=&quot;gulfnews1&quot;/&gt;

===Kurti===
In modern usage, a short kurta is referred to as the [[kurti top|kurti]]. However, traditionally, the kurti refers to waist coats,&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=WfYCAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA260&amp;dq=kurti+waistcoat&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CEAQ6AEwAmoVChMI9N_qvdbuxgIVRLwUCh1megCb#v=onepage&amp;q=kurti%20waistcoat&amp;f=false Forbes, Duncan (1861) A smaller Hindustani and English dictionary]&lt;/ref&gt; jackets and blouses&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=debQiFq5jjgC&amp;pg=PA368&amp;dq=kurti+waistcoat&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CFEQ6AEwBWoVChMI9N_qvdbuxgIVRLwUCh1megCb#v=onepage&amp;q=kurti%20waistcoat&amp;f=false Bahri, Hardev (2006)  Advanced learner's Hindi English Dictionary]&lt;/ref&gt; which sit above the waist without side slits, and are believed to have descended from the tunic of the [[Shunga Empire|Shunga period]] (2nd century B.C.).&lt;ref&gt;Panjab University Research Bulletin: Arts, Volume 13, Issue 1 - Volume 14, Issue (1982) [https://books.google.co.uk/books?ei=PgKHVa7dK8arUazcgLgD&amp;id=nvE7AQAAIAAJ&amp;dq=kurtaka+punjabi+kurti&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=Shunga]&lt;/ref&gt; Kurtis are typically much shorter than the traditional garments and made with a lighter materials, like those used in sewing [[Salwar kameez|kameez]]. 

==Material==
Kurtas worn in the summer months are usually made of thin silk or cotton fabrics; winter season kurtas are made of thicker fabric such as [[wool]] or ''[[Khadi]] silk'', a thick, coarse, handspun and handwoven silk that may be mixed with other fibers. A very common fabric for kurta pajama is linen, or linen cotton mix ideal for both summers and winters.

Kurtas are typically fastened with tasselled ties, cloth balls and loops, or buttons. Buttons are often wood or plastic. Kurtas worn on formal occasions might feature decorative metal buttons, which are not sewn to the fabric, but, like cufflinks, are fastened into the cloth when needed. Such buttons can be decorated with jewels, enameling, and other traditional jewelers' techniques.

==Decoration==
South Asian tailors command a vast repertoire of methods, traditional and modern, for decorating fabric. It is likely that all of them have been used, at one time or another, to decorate kurtas. However, the most common decoration is embroidery. Many light summer kurtas feature [[Chikan (embroidery)|Chikan]] embroidery, a speciality of [[Lucknow]], around the hems and front opening. This embroidery is typically executed on light, semi-transparent fabric in a matching thread. The effect is ornate but subtle.

{{Hinduism}}
'''Vijayadashami''' (Sanskrit: विजयादशमी) also known as '''Dussehra''' (Sanskrit: दशहरा) or '''Ayudhapuja''' (Sanskrit: आयुधपूजा), is one of the most important [[Hindu]] festivals and is celebrated in various forms, across  [[Nepal]], [[Sri Lanka]], [[India]], and [[Bangladesh]] as well as parts of [[Pakistan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ibtimes.com/what-dussehra-basics-understanding-2015-hindu-festival-2151118 |title=What Is Dussehra? The Basics To Understanding The 2015 Hindu Festival |first=Christopher |last=Harress |date=22 October 2015 |newspaper=[[International Business Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name Dussehra is derived from [[Sanskrit]]. ''Dasha-hara'' literally means ''Dashanan ravan'' (the name of Ravan and in short ''Dasha'' and ''Hara'' (defeat)) referring to [[Lord Rama]]'s victory over the ten-headed demon king, [[Ravana]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=bhaskar.com|url=http://daily.bhaskar.com/article/JM-vijayadashmi-celebrate-the-victory-of-good-over-evil-2480894.html|title=Vijaydashmi – celebration of good over evil|accessdate=11 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The day also marks the victory of [[Durga|Goddess Durga]] over the demon [[Mahishasur|Mahishasura]]. The name Dussehra is also derived from [[Sanskrit]] Ahaha, which means ''day''. For example, Aharnisha is derived from Ahaha+anisha. The Goddess fought with evils for nine nights and ten days. The name Vijayadashami is also derived from the Sanskrit words &quot;Vijaya-dashami&quot;, literally meaning the ''victory on the dashami'' (''Dashmi'' being the tenth lunar day of the Hindu calendar month). [[Diwali]], the Festival of Lights, is celebrated twenty days after Dussehra.

==Significance==
{{refimprove section|date=December 2014}}
'''Vijayadashami''' is celebrated on the tenth day of the month of [[Ashwin]] according to the [[Hindu calendar|Hindu lunisolar calendar]] which corresponds to September or October of the [[Gregorian calendar]]. The first nine days are celebrated as '''Maha Navratri'''([[Devnagari]]: नवरात्रि, 'nine nights') or Sharada Navratri (the most important [[Navratri]]) and culminates on the tenth day as Dussehra.

In [[India]] and [[Nepal]], the harvest season begins at this time and so the [[Mother Goddess]] is invoked to start the new harvest season and reactivate the vigor and fertility of the soil. This is done through religious performances and rituals which are thought to invoke cosmic forces that rejuvenate the soil. Many people of the Hindu faith observe the festival through social gatherings and food offerings to the gods at home and in temples throughout India and Nepal.

===Victory of Lord Rama over Ravana===
{{See also|Ramayana|Shri Rama|Ravana}}
[[File:Ravana fizzles.jpg|right|thumb|Effigy of Ravana burns]]
As per Hindu religion, on this day in the Treta Yug, [[King Rama]] (also called Shri Ram) the seventh [[avatar]] of [[Vishnu]], killed [[Ravana]] who had abducted Rama's wife [[Sita]] to his kingdom of Lanka. Rama, his brother [[Lakshmana]], their follower [[Hanuman]] and an army fought a great battle to rescue Sita. The entire narrative is recorded in the epic [[Ramayana]], a Hindu scripture.

[[Rama]] had performed &quot;Chandi Homa&quot; and invoked the blessings of Durga, who blessed Rama with secret knowledge of the way to kill Ravana. On the day of Ashvin Shukla Dashami, Rama defeated Ravana and rescued Sita. Thus it is termed as ''Vijaya Dashami''. Based on the inferences from Valmiki’s Ramayana, Kalidas’s Raghuvamsa, Tulsidas’s Ram Charit Manas, and Keshavdas's Ram Chandra Yas Chandrika as well as common perception in India, Rama, Sita, and Lakshmana returned to Ayodhya on the 30th day of Ashwin (19–20 days after Vijayadashmi). To mark the return of Lord Rama, in the evening, the residents of Ayodhya lit their city with millions of earthen lamps (called Deepak). Since then, this day is celebrated in India as Deepawali or [[Diwali]].

Many people perform &quot;Aditya Homa&quot; as a &quot;Shanti Yagna&quot; and recite [[Sundara Kanda]] of ''Srimad Ramayana'' for five days. These Yagna performances are thought to create powerful agents in the atmosphere surrounding the house that will keep the household environment clean and healthy.
 
Some householders perform Yagnas three times daily along with [[Sandhya Vandana]], which is also called Aahavaneeya Agni, Grahapatya Agni or Dakshina Agni. In addition, the Aditya Homa is performed with the Maha Surya Mantras and the Aruna Prapathaka of the Yajurveda. These mantras are believed to keep the heart, brain and digestive functions in balance in the absence of adequate sunlight in the winter months.

===Victory of Durga Mata over Mahishasura===
{{main|Mahishasura}}
{{See also|Maa Durga}}
[[File:Bagbazar Sarbojanin Arnab Dutta 2010.JPG|thumb|Durga Puja at [[Bagbazar]] Sarbajanin, North [[Kolkata]].]]
Some of the demons, or [[Asura]]s, were very powerful and ambitious and continually tried to defeat the Devas, or Gods, and capture Heaven. One Asura, [[Mahishasura]], grew very powerful and created havoc on the earth. Under his leadership, the Asuras defeated the Devas. The world was crushed under Mahishasura's tyranny, the Devas joined their energies into [[Shakti]], a single mass of incandescent energy, to kill Mahishasura.

A very powerful band of lightning emerged from the mouths of [[Brahma]], [[Vishnu]] and [[Shiva]] and a young, beautiful female virgin with ten hands appeared. All the Gods gave their special weapons to her. This Shakti coalesced to form the goddess Durga. Riding on a lion who assisted her, Durga fought Mahishasura. The battle raged for nine days and nights. Finally on the tenth day of Ashvin shukla paksha, Mahishasura was defeated and killed by Durga.

Hence ''Dasha-Hara'' is also known as '''[[Navratri]]''' or '''Durgotsav''' and is a celebration of Durga's victory. Durga, as Consort of Lord Shiva, represents two forms of female energy – one mild and protective and the other fierce and destructive.

===Homecoming of Durga Mata===
{{main|Maa Durga}}

[[Daksha]], the Lord of the Earth, and his wife [[Prasuti]], had a daughter called Sati. As a child, Sati started worshiping Lord Shiva as her would-be-husband. Lord Shiva was pleased with Sati's worship of him and married her. Daksha was against their marriage but could not prevent it. Daksha arranged a yagna to which everyone except Lord Shiva was invited. Sati, feeling ashamed of her father's behavior and shocked by the attitude meted towards her husband, killed herself. Lord Shiva was anguished when he discovered this. He lifted Sati's body on his shoulders and started dancing. As the supreme power was dancing with wrath, the world was on the verge of destruction.

Lord [[Narayana]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;cthename forward as a saviourand used his Chakra to cut Sati's body into pieces. Those pieces fell from the shoulders of the dancing Shiva and scattered throughout the Indian subcontinent. Shiva was pacified when the last piece fell from his shoulder. Lord Narayana revived Sati. The places where the pieces of Sati fell are known as the &quot;Shakti Piths&quot; or energy pits. Kalighat in Kolkata, Kamakshya near Guwahati and Vaishnav Devi in Jammu are three of these places.

In her next birth, Sati was born as [[Parvati]] or Shaila-Putri (First form of Durga), the daughter of Himavat, ruler of the [[Himalayas]]. Lord Narayana asked Shiva to forgive Daksha. Ever since, peace was restored and Durga with her children Kartikeya, Ganesh and her two ''sakhis'' – Jaya and Vijaya visit her parents each year during the season of ''Sharatkal'' or autumn, when '''Durga-Puja''' is celebrated.

===End of Agnyatawas of Pandavas===
{{See also|Pandavas}}

In the age of [[Dvapara Yuga]], [[Pandavas]] – the five acknowledged sons of Pandu (Sanskrit: पाण्डु ), by his wife Kunti – lost to [[Kauravas]] in a game of dice, and both spent twelve years of ''Vanawas'', or exile to the forest, followed by one year of ''Agnyatawas''. The brothers hid their weapons in a hole in a [[Prosopis spicigera|Shami tree]] before entering the Kingdom of Virat to complete the final year of Agnyatawas (exile incognito). After that year, on Vijayadashmi, they recovered the weapons, declared their true identities and defeated Kauravas, who had attacked King Virat to steal his cattle. Since that day, Shami trees and weapons have been worshipped and the exchange of Shami leaves on Vijayadashmi has been a symbol of good will and victory. This is also called '''Shami/Jambi Puja'''.

===Kautsa's Guru Dakshina===
Kautsa, the young son of a [[Brahmin]] called Devdatt, lived in the city of [[Paithan]]. After completing his education with Rishi Varatantu, he insisted on his [[guru]] accepting [[Guru Dakshina]], a present. The guru said, &quot;Kautsa, to give ''dakshina'' in return for ''learning wisdom'' is not appropriate. Graduation of the disciple makes the guru happy, and that is the real Guru Dakshina.&quot;

Kautsa was not satisfied. He still felt it was his duty to give his guru something. The guru said, &quot;All right, if you insist on giving me ''dakshina'', then give me 140 million gold coins, 10 million for each of the 14 sciences I have taught you.&quot;

Kautsa went to King Raghu. Raghuraja was an ancestor of Lord Rama, famous for his generosity. But just at that time he had spent all his money on the Brahmins, after performing the ''Vishvajit sacrifice''. Raghuraja asked Kautsa to return in three days. Raghuraja immediately left to get the gold coins from [[Indra]]. Indra summoned [[Kuber]], the god of wealth. Indra told Kuber, &quot;Make rain full of gold coins, fall on the ''Shanu'' and ''Aapati'' trees around Raghuraja's city of Ayodhya.&quot;

The rain of gold coins began to fall. King Raghu gave all the coins to Kautsa, and Kautsa hastened to offer the coins to Varatantu Rishi. Guru had asked only 140 millions, so he gave the rest back to Kautsa. Kautsa was not interested in money, considering honour to be more valuable than wealth. He asked the king to take the remaining gold coins back. But the king refused, as kings do not take back the ''daan'' (gift).

Finally Kautsa distributed the gold coins to the people of [[Ayodhya]] on the day of Ashvin shukla dashami. In remembrance of this event, there has been a custom of plucking the leaves of the ''Aapati'' tree, and then people present these leaves to one another as gold.

== Dasha-Hara in different parts of India ==
[[File:Ramlila Dasratha.jpg|right|250px|thumb|A scene of Dasratha sending his son Ram for training]]

=== Northern India ===
In [[Kashmir]], [[Himachal Pradesh]], [[Uttar Pradesh]], [[Haryana]], [[Punjab, India|Punjab]], [[Uttarakhand]] and western [[Bihar]], it is tradition to plant [[barley]] seeds in earthen pots on the first day of Navratri. On the day of Dasara, the nine-day-old sprouts (called ''noratra''s or ''norta''s or of nav ratris or nine nights) are used as symbols of luck. Men place them in their caps or behind their ears.

In most of northern India and some parts of Maharashtra, Dasha-Hara is celebrated more in honour of Rama. During these ten days, many plays and dramas based on Ramayana are performed. These are called '''[[Ramlila]]'''. There are outdoor fairs and large parades with effigies of Ravana (a king of ancient Sri Lanka), his brother Kumbhakarna and son Meghanad. The effigies are burnt on bonfires in the evening. After Dasara, the hot summer ends, especially in [[North India]]. The onset of cold weather is believed to encourage infections. The burning of the effigies, filled with firecrackers containing [[phosphorus]], supposedly purifies the atmosphere, while the temples perform ''Chandi Homa'' or ''Durga Homa'', with the same intent.

In the [[Kumaon division|Kumaon]] region of [[Uttarakhand]], the Dasara festival starts with the performance of [[Ramlila]] which is unique as it is based on the musical rendering of the ''katha'' or story of Lord [[Rama]]. It is based on the theatrical traditions set by [[Uday Shankar]] during his stay in [[Almora]]; these traditions were further enriched by [[Mohan Upreti]] and Brijendra Lal Sah. Known as the Almora or Kumaon style, Ramlila has been recognised by [[UNESCO]] in its 2008 report as one of the representative styles of Ramlila in India.&lt;ref name=un&gt;[http://www.unesco.org/culture/ich/index.php?RL=00110 Ramlila – the Traditional Performance of the Ramayana] ''[[UNESCO]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Himachal Pradesh ====
{{Main|Kullu Dussehra}}
'''Kullu Dussehra''' is celebrated in [[Kullu Valley]] of Himachal Pradesh. It is celebrated in the Dhalpur maidan in the Kullu valley. Dussehra at Kullu commences on the tenth day of the rising moon, i.e. on 'Vijaya Dashami' day itself and continues for seven days. Its history dates back to the 17th century when local King Jagat Singh installed an idol of Raghunath on his throne as a mark of penance. After this, god Raghunath was declared as the ruling deity of the Valley.

===Southern India===
Vijayadashami is celebrated in various ways in different parts of South India. It is seen as a day to express gratitude to everything that bring success in life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://blog.ishafoundation.org/lifestyle/dussehra-vijayadashami/ | title=Dussehra or Vijayadashami – Why Do We Celebrate It? | date=14 October 2013 | accessdate=3 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Celebrations can take many forms, ranging from worshipping the goddess Chamundeshwari (Durga) to exhibiting colorful gift -,they also take admission in school, celebrated as [[Golu]] in Karnataka,Kerala,Telangana, Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu from Navratri onwards.

[[File:Navratri Golu.jpg|thumb|Navaratri [[Golu]], dolls and figurine display festival for girls and women in [[South India]]]]

There is a legend related to the exhibition of toys that is known as &quot;Bombe habba&quot; in Karnataka, &quot;Bommala Koluvu&quot; in Andhra Pradesh,&quot;Bomma Gollu&quot;in Kerala and Golu or Kolu in Tamil Nadu. Since the goddess Durga needed tremendous power, all other gods and goddesses transferred their power to her and they all stood still as statues. To respect the self-sacrifice of these deities during the festival days, Hindus revere murities, which are small statues in the shape of particular gods and goddesses. Golu ends on dussera.

Vijayadashami is also the auspicious day for starting formal education. Students keep their books and workers their tools for puja on the ninth day of Navratri ([[Ayudha Puja]], Saraswathi Puja); these are taken back and used after puja on the tenth day (Vijayadasami). The practice is so old that in many parts of south India, even non-Hindus follow this tradition. In 2004, many churches in Kerala formally adopted the same tradition of introducing young children to education on Dussera day.

[[File:Dussehra - Ravana.JPG|thumb|left|Effigy of [[Ravana]] to be burnt at Multipurpose Ground, South [[Goa]] – 2012]]
Vijayadashami has great importance in the Telugu household. For life events such as starting a new business/ venture, or buying a new home or vehicle, rituals take place on this auspicious day. They perform [[Ayudha Puja]] where they sanctify vehicles and other new items. In the evenings, a procession is taken up in all major cities where people dress up as characters from the Ramayana and perform stage shows called [[Ramlila]]. Huge effigies of [[Ravana]], [[Kumbhakarna]] and [[Indrajit]] or Meghanada are burned, signifying victory of Lord Rama.

This festival is celebrated in all temples of Durgamata. ''Shodasa Upacharam'' is offered to her. During [[Navratri]] (&quot;nine nights&quot;), Goddess Durgamata is decorated in her different aspects like ''Bala Tripura Sundari, Mahishasura Mardhini, Annapoorna, Kali, Raja Rajeshwari, Kanaka Durga, Lakshmi, Saraswati and Gayatri Devi''. On the river banks of Krishna at Vijayawada, in an age-old temple of &quot;Sri Durga Malleswar Swami&quot; and on a hill called &quot;Indra-Kila-Adri&quot;, Dasara &amp; Navratri are celebrated every year with great pomp &amp; show and tens of thousands of people visit this temple during this time. These celebrations are concluded on the tenth day of &quot;Vijaya Dashami&quot;, which is usually a national holiday. In Vijayawada on Vijayadashami day, ''Teppa Utsavam'' is celebrated, in which Durga's image is placed on a big boat decorated with flowers and lights, is celebrated in the evening.

====Andhra Pradesh and Telangana ====
In Andhra and Telangana, younger family members usually pay respects to their elders by giving them the leaves of ''[[Prosopis spicigera|Shami tree]]/ Jambi'' tree, and seeking their blessing. The Durga temple in Warangal is located adjacent at the centre Badrakali Lake. Alampur Jogulamba Temple is one of the Astadasa Shaktipeethas, 18 prominent Temples dedicated to Goddess Shakti. It was also mentioned several times in ancient scriptures. Sharan Navaratri is the biggest festival at Alampur Jogulamba Temple. The concluding event, Theppotsavam (boat festival) is an eye-catching event held on Vijaya Dasami at Krishna – Thungabhadra sangamam (confluence of River Krishna and Tungabhadra). Women play [[Bathukamma]] by placing a clay pot decorated with flowers around which they dance.

===Tamil Nadu and Kerala===
The ninth day of the [[Navratri]] festival is celebrated as ''Saraswati Puja''. The celebrations start with the ''Puja Veypu'' (Offering for Worship). It consists of placing the books for Pooja on the Navami day. It may be in one’s own house, in the local Nursery School run by traditional teachers, or in the local temple. The books will be taken out for reading, after worship, only on the morning of the third day (Vijaya Dashami). It is called ''Puja Eduppu'' (Taking back after Puja). On the Vijayadashami day, [[Vidyarambham]] also known as ''Initiation of Writing'' is celebrated where education for children is formally initiated before they are admitted to nursery schools. The child is made to write for the first time on the rice spread in a plate with the index finger, guided by an elder of the family or by a reputed teacher. [[Ayudha Puja]] , ayudha means tools, (a kind of Giving respect to the tools used for work) is also celebrated by business and industrial houses during this period.

In Maharashtra, the festival is celebrated on the tenth day of the month of Ashwin (which falls in October) according to the Shaka Hindu Calendar. These three and a half days in the Hindu Lunar calendar are considered very auspicious. On the day of Dasara,&lt;ref&gt;Shirgaonkar, Varsha. &quot;“Madhyayugin Mahanavami aani Dasara”.&quot; Chaturang, Loksatta (1996).&lt;/ref&gt; the deities installed on the first day of the Navratri are immersed in water. People visit each other and exchange sweets.

People worship the ''Apta tree ([[Piliostigma racemosum]])'' and exchange its leaves (known as golden leaves) as a symbol of gold wishing each other a bright and prosperous future. The tradition of exchanging ''Apta'' leaves is symbolic of Raghuraja, an ancestor of Rama and [[Kubera]]. Many artisan communities ritually worship tools of all kinds and they are given rest on this specific day. The saffron-coloured Marigold are particularly associated with and sold in significant quantities during this festive period. They are used for both worship and decorating homes and work-places.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Puneites set to celebrate Dasara|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2012-10-24/pune/34707444_1_dasara-navaratra-durga-puja|accessdate=25 October 2012|newspaper=Times of India|date=24 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On this day people also ritually cross the border of their community in a ceremony known as ''Simollanghan'' ([[Marathi language|Marathi]]: सीमोल्लंघन translation: ''crossing the border''). This practice has its roots in the idea that this day is an auspicious one on which to start new ventures. In ancient times kings used the feast of Dasara to cross the frontier and fight against their neighbouring kingdoms. Thus Dasara also marks the beginning of the war season{{Citation needed|date=October 2012}}.

===Eastern India===

====Odisha====

''Vijaya Dashami'' or ''Dussehra'' is celebrated as [[Durga Puja]] in two different ways in [[Odisha]]. In major ''Shakti Peethas'' like Tara Tarini (Breast Shrine of Adi Shakti) and Bimala (Jagannath Temple) or other temples of the goddesses, the Durga Puja is observed with rituals for a period of 10 to 16 days, known as ''Shodasa Upachara''. The goddess [[Durga]] is also worshiped by devotees in different pendals throughout the state. The pendals are beautifully decorated. The last day of the ''Sharodiya Durga Puja'' is known as Vijayadashami. After the last ritual ''Aparajita Puja'' is performed to the goddess, a tearful farewell is offered to her. The women offer ''Dahi-Pakhal'' (cooked rice soaked in water, with curd), Pitha (baked cakes), Mitha (sweets) and fried fish to the Goddess. Most of the community pujas postpone the farewell as long as possible and arrange a grand send-off. The images are carried in processions known as ''Bhasani Jatra'' or ''Bisarjan Jatra'' around the locale and finally are immersed in a nearby river or lake. After the immersion of the deity, people across the state celebrate ''Ravan Podi'', in which they burn an effigy of the demon Ravan.

====Bengal====
[[File:Durga Idol on Dashami.jpg|upright|thumb|Sindur being applied on the forehead of Goddess Durga during [[Vijaya Dashami]].]]
In Bengal, Dussehra is celebrated as [[Durga Puja]]. Deities of the goddess [[Durga]] are worshipped for five days, and on the fifth day (Vijaya Dashami) immersed in a river or pond. This is referred as ''Durga Bisarjan''/'''Bhashaan'''. In Jharkhand, Bengal, Assam and [[Odisha]], the goddess Kali, an appellation of Durga, is also worshipped as a symbol of Shakti (Power).

==Ashok Vijaya Dashmi==
{{refimprove section|date=December 2014}}
The [[B. R. Ambedkar|Ambedkar]]ite people in India celebrate this festival as Ashok Vijayadashmi, since the Mauryan Emperor [[Ashoka]] is believed to have converted to [[Buddhism]] on this day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Nagpur Oranges | url=http://nagpur.nic.in/htmldocs/famous.htm | accessdate=10 January 2009 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090410031555/http://nagpur.nic.in/htmldocs/famous.htm | archivedate=1 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also Dr. Ambedkar had converted to Buddhism on this day at [[Deekshabhoomi]], [[Nagpur]] in 1956, which fell on 14 October in that year.

Nowadays Ashok Vijaya Dashmi is being celebrated all over India by the followers of Dr Babasaheb [[B. R. Ambedkar|Ambedkar]]. The grand festival and congregation is held at Nagpur, [[Maharashtra]], where millions of people gather to remember the Dhhamma-Chakra Pravartan done by Dr Ambedkar and to celebrate Ashoka Vijayadashami. These people do not burn an effigy of [[Ravana]].

Ambedkarite people celebrate it by organizing community celebrations, with speeches and meals. It also accompanied by entertainment programs based on Buddhist themes. In some places it is a full day program.

===Vishwakarma Divas===
Dasha-Hara is also ''Vishwakarma Divas'', the National Labor Day of India. [[Veda Vyasa]] is considered the foremost [[guru]], and Vijayadashami is also celebrated as Vyasa puja.

=== Dasain in Nepal ===
{{Main|Dasain}}
[[File:Tika lagaideko.jpg|thumb|250px|right|An elder of the family doing tika ritual to the younger]]
Vijayadashami (विजयादशमी) or [[Dasain]] (दशैं) is the biggest festival of the year in [[Nepal]] that falls in September/October and is celebrated by Hindu and non-Hindu Nepalis. Among the [[Newar]]s, it is known as [[Mohani]]. The 10th day of Dasain is Vijayadashami, on which elders put Tika and Jamara on the forehead of younger members of the family. Jamara is sown on the first day of the festival which becomes greenish yellow of about 10–20&amp;nbsp;cm length which represent symbol of victory. Some ethnic groups receive Tika and Jamara only on the 10th day whereas others continue to receive until the following full moon. Depending upon the relationship, people offer 'Dakshina' after receiving the Tika and Jamara. On the eighth day of the festival, people offer sacrifice of goats, buffalo, chicken etc. to goddess Durga. Meat is heavily consumed after the sacrifice taken as the gift of god. People visit their relatives and exchange greetings throughout the 15 days of the festival. Temples of goddess Durga are crowded throughout the days of the festival in different parts of the country. For many people and specially children, buying of new clothes bears special importance. The expenditure during the days of the festival is significant. Nepal observes the longest holidays of the year and highest mobility of the people during these days as people visit their relatives. In the past, until the fall of Monarchism in 2008, the only Hindu Monarch on the Planet, the King of Nepal, used to put tika on the foreheads of the people.

=== Dussehra in Bangladesh ===
In [[Bangladesh]], it is a five-day-long festival and is celebrated in mandaps (congregation). The largest festival is held at Dhakeshwari temple and Ramkrishna missionary in Dhaka. On the day of Dasha-Hara, clay statues of the Goddess [[Durga]] are submerged in rivers. The [[Puja (Hinduism)|pooja]] is performed with [[turmeric]] and other pooja items, which are added to the river in order to help the water yield better crops.

===Punjabi Harvest===
On the first day of Navratri people in Punjab sow pulses, cereals and other seeds in a pot which is watered for nine days at the end of which the seeds sprout. This custom is known as &quot;Khetri&quot;. It signifies prosperity  and abundance. It is very important to plant grains of barley in a pot. On the tenth day, the shoots are about 3 - 5 inches in length. After saying prayers, these seedlings or the &quot;Khetri&quot; is submerged in water on Dussehra. This custom suggests a link to harvesting. The sowing and reaping of barley is symbolic of the &quot;first fruit&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mantraonnet.com/navratri.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Accordingly, Punjabi farmers harvest the [[kharif crop]] after Dussehra with the [[rabi crop]] being planted after [[Diwali]].

[[File:Woman's Two-piece Dress (Wedding) LACMA M.70.90a-b.jpg|300px|thumb|White wedding dress from 1891]]

A '''wedding dress''' or '''wedding gown''' is the [[clothing]] worn by a [[bride]] during a [[wedding]] ceremony. Color, style and ceremonial importance of the gown can depend on the religion and culture of the wedding participants.  In Western cultures, brides often choose a [[white wedding]] dress, which was made popular by Queen Victoria in the 19th century. In eastern cultures, brides often choose red to symbolize auspiciousness.

== Western culture ==
Weddings performed during and immediately following the [[Middle Ages]] were often more than just a union between two people. They could be a union between two families, two businesses or even two countries. Many weddings were more a matter of [[Political alliance|politics]] than [[love]], particularly among the [[nobility]] and the higher social classes. Brides were therefore expected to dress in a manner that cast their families in the most favorable light and befitted their social status, for they were not representing only themselves during the ceremony. Brides from wealthy families often wore rich colors and exclusive fabrics. It was common to see them wearing bold colors and layers of furs, [[velvet]] and [[silk]].  Brides dressed in the height of current fashion, with the richest materials their families' money could buy. The poorest of brides wore their best church dress on their wedding day.  The amount and the price of material a wedding dress contained was a reflection of the bride's social standing and indicated the extent of the family's wealth to wedding guests.

[[Image:1929wedding.jpg|thumb|left|The woman to the far right is wearing a typical wedding dress from 1929. Until the late 1960s, wedding dresses reflected the styles of the day. From that time onward, wedding dresses have often been based on Victorian styles.]]
The first documented instance of a princess who wore a white wedding gown for a royal wedding ceremony is that of [[Philippa of England]], who wore a [[tunic]] with a [[cloak]] in white [[silk]] bordered with grey [[squirrel]] and [[ermine]]) in 1406.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Wedding white doesn't mean what you think it means|url=http://ivybridalstudio.com/wedding-white-doesnt-mean-what-you-think-it-means/|publisher=IBS|accessdate=21 November 2014|quote=Princess Philippa of England is the first recorded princess to have worn white during her wedding in 1406, with her attire consisting of a tunic and cloak in white silk but it wasn’t until Queen Victoria that the white dress would explode in popularity}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.amalfi-wedding-planner.com/eng/StoriaMatrimonio.htm ''The History of Matrimony'']&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mary, Queen of Scots]], wore a white wedding gown in 1559 when she married her first husband, Francis Dauphin of France because it was her favorite color, although white was then the color of mourning for French Queens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mary, Queen of Scots’ first wedding day|url=http://madameguillotine.org.uk/2011/04/24/mary-queen-of-scots-first-wedding-day/|accessdate=21 November 2014|quote=Mary’s choice of a white wedding dress was an unusual one, particularly as white was more traditionally worn by royal ladies when they were in dieul blanc mourning but in this as in other things the strong willed Mary may well have been an innovator, keen to not just impress her own taste on her wedding day (after all, she hadn’t been allowed the privilege of choosing her groom) but also emphasise her virginity and show off her famously pale redheaded beauty, which would have been accentuated by a pure white dress.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Elizabeth I Facts|url=http://www.elizabethfiles.com/resources/elizabeth-i-facts/|accessdate=21 November 2014|quote=Her favourite dress colours were white and black which symbolised purity.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This was not a widespread trend, however: prior to the [[Victorian era]], a bride was married in any color, black being especially popular in Scandinavia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sydaby.eget.net/swe/jp_marriage.htm &quot;Old Marriage Customs in Finland&quot;] ''Old Marriage Customs in Finland''&lt;/ref&gt;

White became a popular option in 1840, after the marriage of [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria]] to [[Albert of Saxe-Coburg]], where Victoria wore a white gown  to incorporate some lace she prized. The official wedding portrait photograph was widely published, and many brides opted for white in accordance with the Queen's choice.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.royalcollection.org.uk/default.asp?action=article&amp;ID=405 &quot;Royal Weddings 1840 - 1947: From Queen Victoria to Queen Elizabeth II&quot;] ''History of the Wedding Dress''&lt;/ref&gt;

Even after that, for a period, wedding dresses were adapted to the styles of the day. For example, in the 1920s, they were typically short in the front with a longer train in the back and were worn with [[cloche hat|cloche]]-style wedding veils. This tendency to follow current fashions continued until the late 1960s, when it became popular to revert to long, full-skirted designs reminiscent of the Victorian era.

Today, Western wedding dresses are usually [[white (colour)|white]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://imprint.printmag.com/color/the-bride-wore-chartreuse-why-most-wedding-dresses-are-white/ PRINT Magazine, ''The Bride Wore Chartreuse: Why (Most) Wedding Dresses are White''] by Jude Stewart&lt;/ref&gt; though &quot;wedding white&quot; includes shades such as [[eggshell (colour)|eggshell]], [[ecru (colour)|ecru]] and [[ivory (color)|ivory]].

Later, many people assumed that the color white was intended to symbolize [[virginity]], though this was not the original intention: it was the color [[blue (color)|blue]] that was connected to purity, piety, faithfulness, and the [[Virgin Mary]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title = Folk and Fairy Tales: A Handbook��–Greenwood Folklore Handbooks

===Current fashion===
About 75 percent of wedding dresses on the market are [[strapless dress]]es or [[sleeveless]], in part because such dresses require less skill from the designers and are easier to [[tailor|alter to fit]] correctly.&lt;ref name=&quot;Goldstein&quot;&gt;{{cite news

Many wedding dresses today have been based on Victorian, older styles, and the styles they wore in the 1900s through the 1990s

==Eastern culture==
{{unreferenced section|date=November 2014}}
Many wedding dresses in [[China]], [[India]] ([[wedding sari]]), [[Pakistan]] and [[Vietnam]] (in the traditional form of the [[Ao dai]]) are red, the traditional colour of good luck and auspiciousness. Nowadays, many women choose other colours besides red. In modern mainland Chinese weddings, the bride may opt for Western dresses of any colour, and later don a traditional costume for the official [[Chinese tea culture|tea ceremony]].  

[[Image:TraditionalChineseWeddingDress.jpg|left|thumb|Qing dynasty styled traditional Chinese wedding dress with [[phoenix crown]] (鳳冠) headpiece still used in modern [[Taiwan]]ese weddings.]] 
In modern [[Taiwan]]ese weddings, the bride generally picks red (following Chinese tradition) or white (more Western) silk for the wedding gown material, but most will wear the red traditional garment for their formal wedding banquets. Traditionally, the father of the bride is responsible for the [[Chinese_marriage#Traditional_marriage_rituals|wedding banquet]] hosted on the bride's side and the alcohol (specifically called &quot;xi-jiu,&quot; confusingly the same as what the wedding banquet itself is called) consumed during both banquets. While the wedding itself is often based on the couple's choices, the wedding banquets are a symbolic gesture of &quot;thanks&quot; and appreciation, to those that have raised the bride and groom (such as grandparents and uncles) and those who will continue to be there to help the bride and groom in the future. Thus out of respect for the elders, wedding banquets are usually done formally and traditionally. 

Red [[wedding sari]]s are the traditional garment choice for brides in [[India]]n culture. Sari fabric is also traditionally silk. Over time, colour options and fabric choices for Indian brides have expanded. Today fabrics like crepe, Georgette, charmeuse, and satin are used, and colors have been expanded to include gold, pink, orange, maroon, brown, and yellow as well. Indian brides in Western countries often wear the [[sari]] at the wedding ceremony and change into traditional Indian wear afterwards ([[lehnga]], [[choli]], etc.).

[[Image:Wedding kimono.jpg|right|thumb|Japanese formal wedding dress still used today.]]
A [[Japanese wedding]] usually involves a traditional pure white kimono for the formal ceremony, symbolizing purity and maidenhood. The bride may change into a red kimono for the events after the ceremony for good luck.

The [[Javanese people]] of [[Indonesia]] wear a [[kebaya]], a traditional kind of blouse, along with [[batik]].

In the [[Philippines]], variations of the [[Baro't saya]] adapted to the white wedding tradition are considered to be wedding attire for women, along with the [[Barong Tagalog]] for men. Various tribes and [[Muslim Filipino]]s don other forms of traditional dress during their respective ceremonies.

== Native American culture ==
{{unreferenced section|date=August 2014}}
[[Image:Apache bride.jpg|left|thumb|[[Apache]] bride]]
The [[indigenous peoples of the Americas]] have varying traditions related to weddings and thus wedding dresses.  A [[Hopi]] bride traditionally had her garments woven by the groom and any men in the village who wished to participate. The garments consisted of a large belt, two all-white wedding robes, a white wedding robe with red stripes at top and bottom, white buckskin leggings and moccasins, a string for tying the hair, and a reed mat in which to wrap the outfit. This outfit also served as a shroud, since these garments would be necessary for the trip through the underworld.

A [[Pueblo]] bride wore a cotton garment tied above the right shoulder, secured with a belt around the waist.

In the traditions of the [[Delaware]], a bride wore a knee-length skirt of deerskin and a band of wampum beads around her forehead. Except for fine beads or shell necklaces, the body was bare from the waist up. If it was a winter wedding, she wore deerskin leggings and moccasins and a robe of turkey feathers. Her face was painted with white, red and yellow clay.

The tribes of Northern [[California]] (which include the [[Klamath people|Klamath]], the [[Modoc people|Modoc]] and the [[Yurok people|Yurok]]) had a traditional bridal dress woven in symbolic colors: white for the east, blue for the south, yellow (orange) for the west; and black for the north. Turquoise and silver jewelry were worn by both the bride and the groom in addition to a silver concho belt. Jewelry was considered a shield against evils including hunger, poverty and bad luck.

'''Makar Sankranti''' is a [[Hinduism|Hindu]] festival celebrated in almost all parts of [[India]], [[Nepal]] and [[Bangladesh]] in many cultural forms. It is a [[harvest festival]] that falls on the [[Magh (Nepali calendar)|Magh]] month of the [[Nepali calendar]] (Hindu Solar Calendar).

Makar Sankranti marks the transition of the sun into the zodiacal sign of Makara (Capricorn) on its celestial path.&lt;ref name=pujajagat&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; The day is also believed to mark the arrival of spring in India and the [[Magh (Nepali calendar)|Magh]] month in [[Nepal]] and is a traditional event. Makara Sankranthi is a solar event making it one of the few [[Hindu]] festivals which fall on the same date in the [[Nepali calendar]] every year: 14 January, with some exceptions when the festival is celebrated on 15 January.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.drikpanchang.com/sankranti/makar-sankranti-date-time.html?year=2016 |title = 2016 Makar Sankranti Time |work=www.drikpanchang.com |accessdate = 14 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Date and significance ==
Makar Sankranti is observed at the beginning of the [[Capricorn (astrology)|Capricorn]] period under the [[Sidereal and tropical astrology|sidereal zodiac]], either 14 or 15 January, and signifies the arrival of the summer season.&lt;ref name=Times&gt;{{cite news | url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/lucknow/Confusion-over-date-of-Makar-Sankranti/articleshow/421357.cms | title=Confusion over date of Makar Sankranti | author=TNN | date=14 January 2004 | newspaper=The Times of India | accessdate=15 January 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Makar Sankranti and the Winter Solstice==
[[File:Earth-lighting-winter-solstice EN.png|Winter Solstice|right|thumb]]

Many Indians conflate this festival with the [[Winter Solstice]], and believe that the sun ends its southward journey (Sanskrit: ''[[Dakshinayana]]'') at the Tropic of Capricorn, and starts moving northward (Sanskrit: ''Uttarayaana'') towards the [[Tropic of Cancer]], in the Nepalese Hindu month of ''[[Poush]]]'' on this day in mid-January.

While there is no overt solar observance of Winter Solstice in the Indian religion, the Vaikuntha Ekadashi festival, calculated on the lunar calendar, falls the closest. Further, the Sun makes its northward journey on the day after [[winter solstice]] when day light increases. Therefore, Makar Sankranti signifies the celebration of the day following the day of winter solstice.

Scientifically, currently in the Northern Hemisphere, [[winter solstice]] occurs between 21 and 22 December. Day light will begin to increase on 22 December and on this day, the Sun will begin its northward journey which marks ''Uttarayaan''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://consciousevolution.com/metamorphosis/0212/hindumyth0212.htm Sun - in Hindu Mythology by Anindita Basu]&lt;/ref&gt; The date of winter solstice changes gradually due to the [[Axial precession|Axial precession of the Earth]], coming earlier by approximately 1 day in every 70 years. Hence, if the Makara Sankranti at some point of time did mark the day after the actual date of winter solstice, a date in mid-January would correspond to around 300CE, the heyday of Indian mathematics and astronomy.

==Sankranti==
Sankranti is celebrated all over South India with some regional variations. It is known by different names and celebrated with different customs in different parts of the country popularly celebrated in Karnataka (Sankranthi), Telangana (Sankranthi), Andhra pradesh (Sankranthi) and Tamil Nadu (Pongal), Uttarakhand(Makar Sankranti).

==Traditions, rituals and celebration==

===Nepal===
[[Maghe Sankranti]] (Nepali and Maithili: माघे सङ्क्रान्ति, Nepal Bhasa: घ्यःचाकु संल्हु) is a Nepalese festival observed on the first of Magh in the [[Bikram Samwat]] Hindu Solar Nepali calendar (about 14 January), bringing an end to the ill-omened month of Poush when all religious ceremonies are forbidden. On this day, the sun is believed to leave its southernmost position and begin its northward journey. Maghe Sankranti is similar to solstice festivals in other religious traditions.

Believers take ritual baths during this festival, notably at auspicious river locations. These include Sankhamul on the Bagmati near Patan; in the Gandaki/Narayani river basin at Triveni near the Indian border; [[Devghat]] near Chitwan Valley and Ridi on the Kaligandaki; and in the Koshi River basin at Dolalghat on the Sun Koshi. Festive foods like laddoo, ghee and sweet potatoes are distributed to relatives and friends. The mother of each household wishes good health to all family members.

The legend states that a successful businessman was curious as to why his supply of sesame seed seemed to be never ending. When he inspected the bag he found an idol of Lord Vishnu, the preserver.

According to Mahabharata, [[Bhishma]], who had the power to control his own death, chose to die on the day of Maghe Sakranti. Therefore, it is believed that one who dies on this day might achieve Moksha, a release from rebirth cycle.

As per [[Kirat]] and [[Madhesi people|Madhesi]] community this festival is celebrated as a start of a new year which is called Yele Dhung. Based on the rical{{clarify|date=January 2016}} evidence, the Kirat and [[Mithila, Nepal|Mithila]]calendar was started when King Yalamber  and [[Janaka]] respectively and they conquered Kathmandu valley.

===India===

It is celebrated differently across regions of India.

=== [[Andhra Pradesh]] and [[Telangana]]===
The festival, Sankranti (మకర సంక్రాంతి), is celebrated for four days in Andhra Pradesh and Telangana:
* Day 1 – Bhoghi (భోగి) (Andhra Pradesh, Telangana and Karnataka)
* Day 2 – Makara Sankranti (మకర సంక్రాంతి-పెద్ద పండుగ), the main festival day
* Day 3 – Kanuma (కనుమ) (Andhra Pradesh And Telangana]
* Day 4 — Mukkanuma (Andhra Pradesh And Telangana]

The day preceding Makara Sankranti is called Bhoghi (భోగి). This is when people discard old and derelict things and concentrate on new things causing change or transformation. At dawn, people light a bonfire with logs of wood, other solid fuels and wooden furniture that are no longer useful. The disposal of derelict things is where all old habits, vices, attachment to relations and material things are sacrificed in the fire of the knowledge of Rudra, known as the &quot;Rudra Gita Gyana Yagna&quot;. It represents realization, transformation and purification of the soul by imbibing and inculcating divine virtues.

In many families, infants and children (usually less than three years old) are showered with the Indian jujube fruit [[Ziziphus mauritiana]], called &quot;Regi Pandlu&quot; in Telugu. It is believed that doing this protects the children from the evil eye. Sweets in generous quantities are prepared and distributed. It is a time for families to congregate. Landlords give gifts of food, clothes and money to their workforce.

The second day is Makara Sankranti. People wear new clothes, pray to God, and make offerings of traditional food to ancestors who have died. They also make beautiful and ornate drawings and patterns on the ground with chalk or flour, called &quot;muggu&quot; or &quot;Rangoli&quot; in Telugu, in front of their homes. These drawings are decorated with flowers, colours and small, hand-pressed piles of cow dung, called &quot;gobbemma&quot; (గొబ్బెమ్మ).

For this festival all families prepare Chakinalu, Nuvvula Appalu, Gare Appalu or Katte Appalu or karam appalu, Madugulu (Jantikalu), Bellam Appalu, kudumulu, Ariselu, Appalu (a sweet made of jaggery and rice flour) dappalam (a dish made with pumpkin and other vegetables) and make an offering to God.

On the day after Makara Sankranti, the animal kingdom is remembered and, in particular, cows. Girls feed the animals, birds and fish as a symbol of sharing. Travel is considered to be inappropriate, as these days are dedicated for re-union of the families. Sankranti in this sense demonstrates their strong cultural values as well as a time for change and transformation. And finally, gurus seek out their devotees to bestow blessings on them.

On the third day, Kanuma (కనుమ) is celebrated. Kanuma is very intimate to the hearts of farmers because it is the day for praying and showcasing their cattle with honor. Cattle are the symbolic indication of prosperity.

Nowadays Kanuma is not celebrated as widely as it used to be, but it is an integral part of the Sankranti culture and is meant for thanksgiving to cattle.

The fourth day is called Mukkanuma (ముక్కనుమ) which is popular among the non-vegetarians of the society. On this day, farmers offer prayers to the elements (like soil, rain, fire for helping the harvest) and the (village) goddesses with their gifts which sometimes (and these days mainly) include animals.

People in Coastal Andhra do not eat any meat (or fish) during the first three days of the festival and do so only on the day of Mukkanuma.

Kanuma, Mukkanuma and the day following Mukkanuma call for celebrations with union of families, friends, relatives followed by fun activities, which mainly include cock fighting, bullock/ox racing, kite flying, and ram (pottelu) fighting.

On this occasion, in every town and city, people play with kites and the sky is filled with beautiful kites. Children and elders enjoy this occasion.

Another notable feature of the festival in Andhra Pradesh is the ''Haridasu'' who goes early in the morning around with a colourfully dressed cow, singing songs of Lord Vishnu (Hari) hence the name Haridasu (servant of Hari). It is a custom that he should not talk to anyone and only sing songs of Lord Vishnu when he goes to everyone's house.

===Bihar and Jharkhand===
[[File:Teel Barfi.jpg|thumbnail|right|Teel Barfi made predominantly of teel (sesame seeds) and gud]]
In [[Bihar]] and [[Jharkhand]], the festival is celebrated on 14–15 January.

On 14 January, it is celebrated as Makar Sankranti or Sakraat or Khichdi (in local dialects). As in other parts of country, people take baths in rivers and ponds and feast upon seasonal delicacies as a celebration of good harvest. The delicacies include chura, gur (jaggery), sweets made of til (sesame seeds) such as tilgul, tilwa, maska, etc., curd, milk and seasonal vegetables. Kite flying festivals are organised, albeit on a small scale.

On 15 January, it is celebrated as Makraat (in some parts of the state) when people relish special [[khichdi]] (dal-rice replete with cauliflower, peas and potatoes).

The festival is one of the most important. People start their day by worshiping and putting til (sesame seeds) into fire followed by eating &quot;dahi-chuda&quot;, a dish made of beaten rice (chuda or poha, in Hindi, or avalakki, in Kannada) served with a larger serving of dahi (curd), with cooked kohada (red pumpkin) that is prepared specially with sugar and salt but no water. The meal is generally accompanied by tilkut and lai ([[laddu]] made of til, chuda and rice). The festive meal is traditionally made by women in groups. Since the meal is heavy, lunch is generally skipped on the day and the time is, instead, spent on socializing and participating in kite flying festivals.

At night a special khichdi is made and served with its four traditional companions, &quot;char yaar&quot; (four friends) — chokha (roasted vegetable), [[papad]], [[ghee]] and [[achaar]]. Since such a rich khichdi is generally made on this festival, the festival is often colloquially referred to as &quot;Khichdi&quot;.

===Delhi and Haryana===
Yadavs, Jats and other rural communities of Delhi and Haryana and many neighbouring states consider Sakraat or Sankranti to be a main festival of the year. Churma of ghee, halwa and kheer are cooked specially in Jats and Yadavs homes on this day. One brother of every married woman visits her home with a gift of some warm clothing for her and her husband's family. It is called &quot;Sidha&quot;. Women used to give a gift to their in-laws, and this rituals called &quot;Manana&quot;. The recipient will sit in a haweli (main palace where men sit together and share hookka). Women go to haweli to sing folk songs and give gifts.

===Goa===
Celebrations in Goa closely resemble to that in Maharashtra. The women celebrate 'haldi-kumkum'.

===Gujarat===
Uttarayan, as Makara Sankranti is called in Gujarati, is a major festival in the state of Gujarat which lasts for two days.

* 14 January is Uttarayan
* 15 January is Vasi-Uttarayan (Stale Uttarayan) especially in Surat

Gujarati people keenly await this festival to fly kites, called 'patang'. Kites for Uttarayan are made of special light-weight paper and bamboo and are mostly rhombus shaped with central spine and a single bow. The string often contains abrasives to cut down other people's kites.

In Gujarat, from December through to Makara Sankranti, people start enjoying Uttarayan. [[Undhiyu]] (spicy, baked mix of winter vegetables) and chikkis (made from til (sesame seeds), peanuts and jaggery) are the special festival recipes savoured on this day.

In the major cities of Ahmedabad, Surat, Vadodara, Rajkot, and Jamnagar the skies appear filled with thousands upon thousands of kites as people enjoy two full days of Uttarayan on their terraces.

When people cut any kites they used to yell with words like &quot;kaypo j chhe&quot;, &quot;e lapet&quot;, &quot;phirki vet phirki&quot; and &quot;lapet lapet&quot; in Gujarati.

===Himachal Pradesh===
In Shimla District of Himachal Pradesh, Makara Sankranti is known as Magha Saaji. Saaji is the [[Pahari languages|Pahari]] word for Sakranti, start of the new month. Hence this day marks the start of the month of Magha.

According to Hindu religious texts, on the day of Uttarayani the sun enters the zodiac sign of Makara (Capricon), i.e., from this day onwards the sun becomes 'Uttarayan' or it starts moving to the north. It is said that from this day, which signals a change of season, the migratory birds start returning to the hills. On Magha Saaja people wake up early in the morning and take ceremonial dips and shower in the [[Spring (hydrology)|springs]] or [[baoli]]s. In the daytime people visit their neighbours and together enjoy [[khichdi]] with [[ghee]] and [[chaas]] and give it in charity at temples. Festival culminates with singing and Naati (folk dance).

===Karnataka===
This is the Suggi (ಸುಗ್ಗಿ) or harvest festival for farmers of Karnataka. On this auspicious day, girls wear new clothes to visit near and dear ones with a Sankranti offering in a plate and exchange the same with other families. This ritual is called &quot;Ellu Birodhu.&quot; Here the plate would normally contain &quot;Ellu&quot; (white sesame seeds) mixed with fried groundnuts, neatly cut dry coconut and fine cut bella (jaggery). The mixture is called &quot;Ellu-Bella&quot; (ಎಳ್ಳು ಬೆಲ್ಲ). The plate contains shaped sugar candy moulds (Sakkare Acchu, ಸಕ್ಕರೆ ಅಚ್ಚು) with a piece of sugarcane. There is a saying in Kannada &quot;ellu bella thindu olle maathadi&quot; that translates to 'eat the mixture of sesame seeds and jaggery and speak only good.' This festival signifies the harvest of the season, since sugarcane is predominant in these parts. Ellu Bella, Ellu Unde, bananas, sugarcane, red berries, haldi and kumkum and small gift items useful in everyday lives are often exchanged among women in Karnataka.

In some parts of Karnataka, a newly married woman is required to give away bananas for five years to married women (muthaidhe/sumangali) from the first year of her marriage and increase the number of bananas in multiples of five. There is also a tradition of some households giving away red berries &quot;Yalchi Kai&quot; with the above. In north Karnataka, kite flying with community members is a tradition. Drawing rangoli in groups is another popular event among women during Sankranti.

An important ritual is display of cows and bulls in colourful costumes in an open field. Cows are decorated for the occasion and taken on a procession. They are also made to cross a fire. This ritual is common in rural Karnataka and is called &quot;Kichchu Haayisuvudu.&quot;

===Kerala===
Makara Sankranti is celebrated in Kerala at [[Sabarimala]] where the [[Makara Jyothi]] is visible followed by the [[Makaravilakku]] celebrations.

===Kumaon (Uttarakhand)===
In the [[Kumaon division|Kumaon]] region of Uttarakhand, Makara Sankranti is celebrated with great gusto.

According to Indian religious texts, on the day of Uttarayani also called Ghughuti (घुघुति) in Kumaon, the sun enters the Zodiacal sign of 'Makara' (Capricon), i.e. from this day onwards the sun becomes 'Uttarayan' or it starts moving to the north. It is said that from this day, which signals a change of season, the migratory birds start returning to the hills. On Makara Sankranti people give Khichadi (a mixture of pulses and rice) in charity, take ceremonial dips in holy rivers, participate in the Uttarayani fairs and celebrate the festival of Ghughutia or Kale Kauva. During the festival of Kale Kauva (literal translation 'black crow') people make sweetmeats out of sweetened flour (flour and gur) deep fried in ghee, shape them in shapes such as drums, pomegranates, knives, and swords. They are strung together and worn as necklace, in the middle of which an orange is fixed. Early in the morning children wear these necklaces and sing &quot;Kale Kauva&quot; to attract crows and other birds and offer them portions of these necklaces, as a token of welcome for all the migratory birds, who are now coming back after their winter sojourn in the plains.

Wearing garlands of the above eatables the children come out calling the crows with following song on their lips:
{{quote|
''Kale Kale,''&lt;br /&gt;
''bhol bate aile bor puwa,''&lt;br /&gt;
''Khale Ie Kauva bara,''&lt;br /&gt;
''mai ke de sunu gharo,'' &lt;br /&gt;
''Ie Kauva dhal,''&lt;br /&gt;
''mai ke de sunu thai.''

काले कौवा काले घुघुति माला खाले&lt;br /&gt;
ले कौवा बड़ा मकें दे सुणो घड़ा&lt;br /&gt;
ले कौवा ढाल मकें दे सुणो थाल

(''Come dear crow, come daily you will enjoy eating bara and puwa. Take the bara and give me a pitcher full of gold. Take the shield and give me a golden plate.'')}}

===Maharashtra===
[[File:Tilgul kha god god bola.jpg|thumb|Multicolored sugar halwa surrounded by til-gul (sesame and jaggery) ladoos. These exchanged and eaten on Makara Sankranti in Maharashtra]]
In Maharashtra on Makara Sankranti (मकर संक्रान्ति) day people exchange multicoloured halwa (sugar granules coated in sugar syrup) and ''til-gul laadoo'' (sweetmeats made from sesame seeds and jaggery). ''Gulachi poli/puran poli'' (गुळाची पोळी / पुरण पोळी) (flat bread stuffed with soft/shredded jaggery mixed with toasted, ground til [white sesame seeds]) and some gram flour, which has been toasted to golden in pure ghee, are offered for lunch. While exchanging ''til-gul'' as tokens of goodwill people greet each other with the words &quot;तिळगुळ घ्या, आणि गोड-गोड बोला / til-gul ghyaa, aani goad-goad bolaa&quot; meaning ‘Accept this ''til-gul'' (sweet) and utter sweet words’. The underlying thought in the exchange of ''til-gul'' is to forget the past ill-feelings and hostilities and resolve to speak sweetly and remain friends. The importance of sesame seeds is it keeps body warm and provide good oil, which is needed as winter dried up the moisture from body.

In Maharashtra, similar to Andhra Pradesh Makar Sankaranti, is normally a three-day festival.

Day 1 is known as Bhogi (भोगी), day 2 as Sankrant (संक्रांत) and day 3 as Kinkrant/Kinkranti (किंक्रांत/किंक्रांती).

The story behind this festival is Sankarasur (संकरासुर) [[Rakshasa]] was very brutal indeed. And He started torturing and killing people. To finish off Sankarasur Goddess Sankranti (संक्रांति) appeared on the earth and killed Sankarasur. To celebrate the downfall of Sankarasur, people started festival Sankranti.

This is a special day for the women in Maharashtra when married women are invited for a get-together called ‘Haldi-Kunku’ (literally meaning turmeric-vermillion) and given gifts such as utensils, clothes etc. Typically, women wear black sarees or black coloured outfits on this occasion. The significance of wearing black is that Sankranti comes at the peak of the winter season and black colour retains and absorbs heat, helping keep warm.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}} Maharashtra is also famous for kite flying on this special occasion.

[[File:BangladeshoGhuri.JPG|thumb|right|Kites waiting to catch the wind, held down by weights]]
Makara Sankranti is one of the most auspicious days for the Indians and is celebrated in almost all parts of India in myriad cultural forms, with great devotion. Millions of people take a dip in places like [[Sagar Island|Ganga Sagar]] (the point where the river Ganges meets the Bay of Bengal) and [[Prayag]] and pray to the Sun God ([[Surya]]). It is celebrated with pomp in southern parts of India as Sankranti in Karnataka (Pongal in Tamil Nadu), and in [[Punjab, India|Punjab]] as [[Maghi]].

Makara Sankranti is also to honour, worship and to pay respect to [[Saraswati]] (Goddess of Knowledge). At the start of this significant event, there is worship for ancestors.

Makara Sankranti identifies a period of enlightenment, peace, prosperity and happiness followed by a period of darkness, ignorance and viciousness with immense sorrow. The six months of northern movement of the sun is followed by six months of southern movement.

Since the festival is celebrated in mid-winter, food prepared for this festival is such that it keeps the body warm and gives high energy. [[Laddu]] of ''til'' made with jaggery is a speciality of the festival. In the western Indian state of [[Maharashtra]] it is called 'Tilgud'. In Karnataka it is called 'Yellu-Bella'. In some states, cattle are decorated with colours and are made to jump over a bonfire.

===Odisha===
In [[Odisha]] people prepare ''makara chaula'' ({{lang-or|ମକର ଚାଉଳ}}): uncooked newly harvested rice, banana, [[coconut]], [[jaggery]], [[sesame]], [[Rasgulla|rasagola]], Khai/Liaa and [[chhena]] puddings for naivedya to gods and goddesses. The withdrawing winter entails a change in food habits and intake of nourishing and rich food. Therefore, this festival holds traditional cultural significance. It is astronomically important for devotees who worship the sun god at the great Konark temple with fervour and enthusiasm as the sun starts its annual swing northwards.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bhubaneswar-MS&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|author=Times News Network (TNN)|date=15 January 2014|title=Makar Sankranti observed with pomp in state|newspaper=The Times of India|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bhubaneswar/Makar-Sankranti-observed-with-pomp-in-state/articleshow/28805682.cms?|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140115181106/http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bhubaneswar/Makar-Sankranti-observed-with-pomp-in-state/articleshow/28805682.cms?|archivedate=15 January 2014|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to various Indian calendars, the Sun's movement changes and the days from this day onwards become lengthier and warmer and so the Sun-God is worshiped on this day as a great benefactor.

Tribal groups celebrate with traditional dancing, eating their particular dishes sitting together, and by lighting bonfires.

===Punjab===
In [[Punjab, India|Punjab]], Makar Sankranti is celebrated as [[Maghi]]. Bathing in a river in the early hours on [[Maghi]] is important. Hindus light lamps with sesame oil as this is supposed to give prosperity and drive away all sins. The Punjabis dance their famous &quot;[[Bhangra (dance)|bhangra]]&quot;. Then they sit down and eat the sumptuous food that is specially prepared for the occasion. It is traditional to eat &quot;kheer&quot;, rice cooked in milk and sugarcane juice. It is also traditional to consume [[khichdi]] and [[jaggery]].

December and January are the coldest months of the year in the [[Punjab]]. [[Maghi]] represents the change of the season to warmer temperatures and increase in daylight. Huge bonfires are lit on the eve of [[Maghi]] and the day is celebrated as [[Lohri]].

===Tamil Nadu===
{{Main|Thai Pongal}}
It is a four-day festival in Tamil Nadu:
* Day 1: Bhogi Pandigai (போகி பண்டிகை)
* Day 2: Thai Pongal (தை பொங்கல்)
* Day 3: Maattu Pongal (மாட்டுப் பொங்கல்)
* Day 4: Kaanum Pongal (காணும் பொங்கல்)

The festival is celebrated four days from the last day of the Tamil month Maargazhi to the third day of the Tamil month Thai.

The first day of festival is Bhogi (போகி). It is celebrated by throwing away and destroying old clothes and materials, by setting them on fire, marking the end of the old and the emergence of the new. In a villages there will be a simple ceremony of &quot;Kappu Kattu&quot; (kappu means secure) will be done. The 'neem' leaves are kept along the walls and roof of the houses. This is to eliminate evil forces.

The second day of festival is [[Thai Pongal]] or simply Pongal. It is the main day of the festival, falling on the first day of the Tamil month Thai which starts with the solar cycle when sun starts moving through the summer solstice. It is celebrated by boiling rice with fresh milk and jaggery in new pots, which are later topped with brown sugar, cashew nuts and raisins early in the morning and allowing it to boil over the vessel. This tradition gives Pongal its name. The moment the rice boils over and bubbles out of the vessel, the tradition is to shout &quot;பொங்கலோ பொங்கல் (Ponggalo Ponggal)!&quot; and blow the sangu (a conch), a custom practised to announce it was going to be a year blessed with good tidings. Then new boiled rice is offered to the Sun god during sunrise, as a prayer which symbolises thanks to the sun for providing prosperity. It is later served to the people in the house for the ceremony. People prepare savouries and sweets such as ''vadai, murukku, payasam'' and visit each other and exchange greetings.

The third day of festival is Maattu Pongal (மாட்டுப் பொங்கல்). It is for offering thanks to cattle, as they help farmers in agriculture. On this day the cattle are decorated with paint, flowers and bells. They are allowed to roam free and fed sweet rice and sugar cane. Some people decorate the horns with gold or other metallic covers. In some places, Jallikattu, or taming the wild bull contest, is the main event of this day and this is mostly seen in the villages.

The fourth day of the festival is Kaanum Pongal (காணும் பொங்கல்: the word kaanum means &quot;to view&quot;). During this day people visit their relatives, friends to enjoy the festive season. It is a day to thank relatives and friends for their support in the harvest. It started as a farmers festival, called as Uzhavar Thirunaal in Tamil. ''[[Kolam]]'' (கோலம்) decorations are made in front of the house during Thai Pongal festival.

===Uttar Pradesh===
In Indian Religion this is the first of the big bathing days. Over two million people gather at their respective sacred places for this holy bathing such as [[Allahabad]] and [[Varanasi]] in Uttar Pradesh and [[Haridwar]] in Uttarakhand.&lt;ref name=&quot;UP-sankranti&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|date=15 January 2012|title=Traditional fervour marks Makar Sankranti|newspaper=The Times of India|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2012-01-15/kanpur/30629290_1_tilkut-traditional-fervour-marks-makar-sankranti|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140115172152/http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2012-01-15/kanpur/30629290_1_tilkut-traditional-fervour-marks-makar-sankranti|archivedate=15 January 2014|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; If they cannot go in river then they bathe at home. There is a compulsion to bathe in the morning while fasting; first they bathe then they eat sweets such as til ladoo and gud laddo (known as ''tillava'' in [[Bhojpuri language|Bhojpuri]]). At some places new clothes are worn on this day.

[[File:Kite flying in Varanasi.jpg|thumb|right| Kite flying in the rooftops of [[Varanasi]]]]
Kite flying is an inevitable part of the festival in Uttar Pradesh,&lt;ref name=&quot;UP-sankranti&quot; /&gt; as with many states of India such as Gujarat and Maharashtra. Like other places in India, the references to sweets, til ([[sesame seeds]]) and gud ([[jaggery]]) are found in the songs sung on this day:

''Meethe Gur me mil gaya Til'',&lt;br&gt;
''Udi Patang aur khil gaye Dil'',&lt;br&gt;
''Jeevan me bani rahe Sukh aur Shanti'',&lt;br&gt;
''Mubarak ho aapko Makar-Sankranti''.

===West Bengal===
In West Bengal, Sankranti, also known as Poush Sankranti named after the Bengali month in which it falls (last date of that month), is celebrated as a harvest festival Poush Parbon ([[Bengali language|Bengali]]: পৌষ পার্বণ). (It falls on 14 January on the Western calendar.) The freshly harvested paddy and the date palm syrup in the form of Khejurer Gur ([[Bengali language|Bengali]]: খেজুরের গুড়)and Patali ([[Bengali language|Bengali]]: পাটালি ) is used in the preparation of a variety of traditional Bengali sweets made with rice flour, coconut, milk and 'khejurer gur' (date palm jaggery) and known as '[[Pitha]]' ([[Bengali language|Bengali]]: পিঠে).

Traditionally, people were required to take a bath before sunrise and then commence their pooja. The food that is consumed consists primarily of sweet potatoes and yams.

Millions of people take a dip in places like Ganga Sagar (the point where the river Ganges meets the Bay of Bengal).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/states/other-states/article2803812.ece|title=Devotees throng Gangasagar on Makara Sankranti|accessdate=15 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ganga Sagar falls in West Bengal.

The ''Magha Mela'' (or '' mini-Kumbh Mela'' held annually at Prayag) and the ''[[Gangasagar]] Mela'' (held at the head of the [[Ganges River]], where it flows into the [[Bay of Bengal]]). Makara Mela in [[Odisha]]. Tusu Mela also called as Tusu Porab is celebrated in many parts of Jharkhand and West Bengal.

==In historical event==
The [[Marathi language|Marathi]] term &quot;Sankrant Kosalali&quot; (सक्रांत
कोसळली), meaning &quot; Sankranti has befallen
us&quot;,or &quot;disaster befallen&quot; is said to have originated from the events of
the [[Third Battle of Panipat]] took place on 14
January 1761, at [[Panipat]] , about 60 miles (97 km)
north of Delhi between a northern expeditionary

'''Holi''' ({{IPAc-en|pron|'|h|əʊ|l|i:}}; {{Lang-sa|होली}} ''Holī'') is a [[spring (season)|spring]] festival, also known as the festival of colours or the festival of sharing love.&lt;ref name=yg/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;OED-Holi&quot;&gt;The New Oxford Dictionary of English (1998) ISBN 0-19-861263-X - p.874 &quot;'''Holi''' /'həʊli:/ '''noun''' a Hindu spring festival ...&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; It is an ancient Hindu religious festival which has become popular with non-Hindus in many parts of South Asia, as well as people of other communities outside Asia.&lt;ref name=keholi&gt;Ebeling, Karin (2010), Holi, an Indian Festival, and its Reflection in English Media; Die Ordnung des Standard und die Differenzierung der Diskurse: Akten des 41. Linguistischen Kolloquiums in Mannheim 2006, 1, 107, ISBN 978-3631599174&lt;/ref&gt;

It is primarily observed in [[India]], [[Nepal]], and other regions of the world with significant populations of Hindus or [[Non-resident Indian and person of Indian origin|people of Indian origin]]. In recent years the festival has spread to parts of Europe and North America as a spring celebration of love, frolic, and colours.&lt;ref&gt;[http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702304795804579096813960372646 A Spring Celebration of Love Moves to the Fall — and Turns Into a Fight]  Gabriele Steinhauser, The Wall Street Journal (3 October 2013)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;online.wsj.com&quot;&gt;[http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702303722604579111531979056974 Holi Festivals Spread Far From India] The Wall Street Journal (2013)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Holi Festival of Colours&quot;&gt;[http://www.visitberlin.de/en/event/05-11-2013/holi-festival-of-colours Holi Festival of Colours] Visit Berlin, Germany (2012)&lt;/ref&gt;

Holi celebrations start on the night before Holi with a [[Holika bonfire]] where people gather, sing, dance and party. The next morning is a free-for-all carnival of colours,&lt;ref name=keholi/&gt; where participants play, chase and colour each other with dry powder and coloured water, with some carrying water guns and coloured water-filled balloons for their [[water fight]]. Anyone and everyone is fair game, friend or stranger, rich or poor, man or woman, children and elders. The frolic and fight with colours occurs in the open streets, open parks, outside temples and buildings. Groups carry drums and other musical instruments, go from place to place, sing and dance. People visit family, friends and foes to throw colour powders on each other, laugh and gossip, then share Holi delicacies, food and drinks. Some drinks are intoxicating. For example, [[Bhang]], an intoxicating ingredient made from [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]] leaves, is mixed into drinks and sweets and consumed by many.&lt;ref name=TOIBhang&gt;{{cite web|title=High on Holi with bhang|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/varanasi/High-on-Holi-with-bhang/articleshow/4245535.cms|work=[[Times of India]]|accessdate=26 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ankita Rao,even it is a holi festival it is celebrated by different people of different religions [http://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2014/03/indias-high-holiday/284448/ India's 'High' Holiday] The Atlantic (17 March 2014)&lt;/ref&gt; In the evening, after sobering up, people dress up and visit friends and family.&lt;ref name=ht/&gt;&lt;ref name=cj/&gt;

Holi is celebrated at the approach of the vernal equinox,&lt;ref name=keholi/&gt; on the [[Phalguna]] [[Purnima (day)|Purnima]] (Full Moon). The festival date varies every year, per the [[Hindu calendar]], and typically comes in March, sometimes February in the [[Gregorian Calendar]]. The festival signifies the victory of good over evil, the arrival of spring, end of winter, and for many a festive day to meet others, play and laugh, forget and forgive, and repair broken relationships, and is also celebrated as a thanksgiving for a good harvest.&lt;ref name=keholi/&gt;&lt;ref name=wd/&gt;

==History and Significance==
{{See also|Holika}}
[[File:Holi Bonfire Udaipur.jpg|left|thumb|Holika bonfire in front of Jagdish Temple in [[Udaipur]], [[Rajasthan]], 2010]]

There is a symbolic legend to explain why Holi is celebrated as a festival of colours. The word &quot;Holi&quot; originates from &quot;Holika&quot;, the evil sister of the demon king [[Hiranyakashipu]]. The festival itself is believed to have origins
from the [[Prahladpuri Temple, Multan|Prahlada-Puri Temple]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefridaytimes.com/31122010/page24.shtml|title=Welcome to The Friday Times - The holi temple by Sohaib Arshad - Pakistan's First Independent Weekly Paper:www.thefridaytimes.com|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; of [[Multan]] in the [[Punjab region]].&lt;ref&gt;A White Trail: A Journey into the heart of Pakistan's Religious Minorities by HAROON KHALID [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=iQIBAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT17&amp;lpg=PT17&amp;dq=prahlada+multan+holi&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=ccS09dwyiB&amp;sig=epwaQJlZ6NZTVvV7B3LJ3edXLPM&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=CfysVO6kM8iG7QbvuIHQAQ&amp;ved=0CCUQ6AEwATgK#v=onepage&amp;q=holi&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt; The original temple of Prahladpuri is said to have been built by [[Prahlada]], Hiranyakashipu's son.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The early history of Multan |author=Syad Muhammad Latif|year=1963|page=3,54|quote=Kasyapa, is believed, according to the Sanscrit texts, to have founded Kashyapa-pura (otherwise known as Multan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hiranyakashipu's own son, [[Prahlada]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.holi2014wall.in/prahlad-and-holika-katha-kahani-in-hindi-and-english/ Prahlad and Holika Katha (Kahani) in Hindi]&lt;/ref&gt; however, disagreed.

He subjected Prahlada to cruel punishments, none of which affected the boy or his resolve to do what he thought was right. Finally, Holika - Prahlada's evil aunt - tricked him into sitting on a pyre with her.&lt;ref name=ht/&gt; Holika was wearing a [[cloak]] that made her immune to injury from fire, while Prahlada was not. As the fire roared, the cloak flew from Holika and encased Prahlada.&lt;ref name=cj/&gt; Holika burned, Prahlada survived. Seeing this,  Hiranyakashipu, unable to control his anger, smashed a pillar with his mace. There was a tumultuous sound, and Lord Vishnu appeared as Lord Narasimha and killed Hiranyakashipu. The bonfire is a reminder of the symbolic victory of good over evil, of Prahlada over Hiranyakashipu, and of the fire that burned Holika.&lt;ref name=wd&gt;Wendy Doniger (Editor), Merriam-Webster's Encyclopedia of World Religions, January 2000, ISBN 978-0877790440, Merriam-Webster, page 455&lt;/ref&gt; The next day when the fire cooled down, people applied ash to their foreheads,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hazarasinghprofessor.org/Final%20Seasonal%20Book%20H.S.pdf Hazara Singh (2010) Seasonal Festivals and Commemorative Days]&lt;/ref&gt; a practice still observed by some people.&lt;ref&gt;Dr Dwivedi, Bhojraj (2014) Religious Basis of Hindu Beliefs.

== Importance of the Festival ==
In the [[Braj]] region of India, where the Hindu deity [[Krishna]] grew up, the festival is celebrated for 16 days (until [[#Rangapanchami|Rangpanchmi]]) in commemoration of the divine love of [[Radha]] for Krishna. The festivities officially usher in spring, with Holi celebrated as a festival of love.&lt;ref name=ind/&gt; There is a symbolic myth behind commemorating Krishna as well. As a baby, Krishna developed his characteristic dark blue skin colour because the she-demon ''[[Putana]]'' poisoned him with her breast milk.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.holifestival.org/legend-radha-krishna.html The Legend of Radha-Krishna], Society for the Confluence of Festivals in India (2009)&lt;/ref&gt;  In his youth, Krishna despaired whether the fair-skinned Radha and other girls would like him because of his skin colour. His mother, tired of the desperation, asks him to approach Radha and colour her face in any colour he wanted. This he does, and Radha and Krishna became a couple. Ever since, the playful colouring of Radha's face has been commemorated as Holi.&lt;ref&gt;R Deepta, A.K. Ramanujan's ‘Mythologies’ Poems: An Analysis, Points of View, Volume XIV, Number 1, Summer 2007, pp 74-81&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lynn Peppas (2010), Holi, Crabtree Publishing, ISBN 978-0-7787-4771-0, pp 12-15&lt;/ref&gt; Beyond India, these legends to explain the significance of Holi (''Phagwah'') are common in some Caribbean and South American communities of Indian origin such as [[Guyana]] and [[Trinidad and Tobago]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.guardian.co.tt/archives/commentary/columnist/2009/03/12/arrival-phagwa The arrival of Phagwa - Holi] The Guardian, Trinidad and Tobago (12 March 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/23/dining/23phagwah.html?_r=0 Eat, Pray, Smear] Julia Moskin, New York Times (22 March 2011)&lt;/ref&gt; It is also celebrated with great fervour in Mauritius.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.holifestival.org/holi-in-mauritius.html Holi in Mauritius]. &quot;Just as the many other major Hindu festivals, the large Indian majority.. celebrate Holi with a lot of enthusiasm in the island of Mauritius. It is an official holiday in the country...&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

The Holi festival has further cultural significance. It is the festive day to end and rid oneself of past errors, to end conflicts by meeting others, a day to forget and forgive. People pay or forgive debts, as well as deal anew with those in their lives. Holi also marks the start of spring, and for many the start of the new year.&lt;ref name=wd/&gt;&lt;ref name=ihh&gt;[http://www.indiaheritage.org/culture/holi.htm Holi] India Heritage: Culture, Fairs and Festivals (2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
[[File:Radha celebrating Holi, c1788.jpg|thumb|[[Radha]] and the [[Gopi]]s celebrating Holi, with accompaniment of music instruments]]
Holi is an important festival to Hindus. It is celebrated at the end of winter, on the last full moon day of the lunar month [[Phalgun]] (February/March), (Phalgun [[Full Moon|Purnima]]), which usually falls in March, sometimes in late February.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.infoplease.com/ipa/A0777465.html|title=Hindu Festival Dates    2005-2015|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The festival has many purposes; most prominently, it celebrates the beginning of Spring. In 17th century literature, it was identified as a festival that celebrated agriculture, commemorated good spring harvests and the fertile land.&lt;ref name=keholi/&gt; Hindus believe it is a time of enjoying spring's abundant colours and saying farewell to winter. To many Hindus, Holi festivities mark the beginning of the new year as well as an occasion to reset and renew ruptured relationships, end conflicts and rid themselves of accumulated emotional impurities from the past.&lt;ref name=wd/&gt;&lt;ref name=ihh/&gt;

It also has a religious purpose, symbolically signified by the legend of Holika. The night before Holi, bonfires are lit in a ceremony known as Holika Dahan (burning of [[Holika]]) or Little Holi. People gather near fires, sing and dance. The next day, Holi, also known as ''Dhuli'' in Sanskrit, or ''Dhulheti'', ''Dhulandi'' or ''Dhulendi'', is celebrated. Children and youth spray coloured powder solutions (''gulal'') at each other, laugh and celebrate, while adults smear dry coloured powder (''abir'') on each other's faces.&lt;ref name=ht/&gt;&lt;ref name=ihh/&gt; Visitors to homes are first teased with colours, then served with Holi delicacies, desserts and drinks.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.holifestival.org/holi-festival.html Holi Festival] see Play of Colors (2009)&lt;/ref&gt; After playing with colours, and cleaning up, people bathe, put on clean clothes, and visit friends and family.&lt;ref name=wd/&gt;

{{anchor|Rangapanchami}} Like Holika Dahan, ''Kama Dahanam'' is celebrated in some parts of [[India]]. The festival of colours in these parts is called ''Rangapanchami'', and occurs on the fifth day after Poornima (full moon).&lt;ref&gt;[http://framework.latimes.com/?attachment_id=26285 Rangapanchami in Bhopal] Los Angeles Times (2011)&lt;/ref&gt;

==History and rituals==
Holi is an ancient Hindu festival with its cultural rituals. It is mentioned in the [[Puranas]], Dasakumara Charita, and by the poet [[Kālidāsa]] during the 4th century reign of Chandragupta II.&lt;ref name=yg&gt;Yudit Greenberg, Encyclopedia of Love in World Religions, Volume 1, ISBN 978-1851099801, page 212&lt;/ref&gt; The celebration of Holi is also mentioned in the 7th-century Sanskrit drama ''[[Ratnavali]]''.&lt;ref name=ori&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/hinduism/holydays/holi_1.shtml Religions – Hinduism: Holi]. BBC. Retrieved on 2011-03-21.&lt;/ref&gt;  The festival of Holi caught the fascination of European traders and British colonial staff by the 17th century. Various old editions of Oxford English Dictionary mention it, but with varying, phonetically derived spellings: ''Houly'' (1687), ''Hooly'' (1698), ''Huli'' (1789), ''Hohlee'' (1809), ''Hoolee'' (1825), and ''Holi'' in editions published after 1910.&lt;ref name=keholi/&gt;

There are several cultural rituals associated with Holi:&lt;ref name=htor&gt;[http://www.holifestival.org/rituals-of-holi.html Rituals of Holi] Society for the Confluence of Festivals in India (2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

;Prepare Holika pyre for bonfire
''Main article:'' [[Holika Dahan]]
[[File:India - Color Powder stalls - 7242.jpg|thumb|Shops start selling colours for Holi in the days and weeks beforehand.]]
Days before the festival people start gathering wood and combustible materials for the bonfire in parks, community centers, near temples and other open spaces. On top of the pyre is an effigy to signify Holika who tricked Prahalad into the fire. Inside homes, people stock up on pigments, food, party drinks and festive seasonal foods such as ''[[gujiya]]'', ''[[mathri]]'', ''[[malpua]]s'' and other regional delicacies.

;Holika dahan
On the eve of Holi, typically at or after sunset, the pyre is lit, signifying Holika Dahan. The ritual symbolises the victory of good over evil. People gather around the fire to sing and dance.&lt;ref name=wd/&gt;

;Play with colours
Holi frolic and celebrations begin the morning after the Holika bonfire. There is no tradition of holding ''puja'' (prayer), and the day is for partying and pure enjoyment. Children and young people form groups armed with dry colours, coloured solution, the means to fill and spray others with coloured solution (''[[pichkari]]s''), water balloons filled with  coloured water, and other creative means to colour their targets.&lt;ref name=htor/&gt;

[[File:Lath Mar Holi at Braj.jpg|thumb|250px|left|In the [[Braj]] region of North India, women have the option to playfully hit men who save themselves with shields; for the day, men are culturally expected to accept whatever women dish out to them. This ritual is called ''Lath Mar'' Holi.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.boston.com/bigpicture/2012/03/lathmar_holi_festival.html Lathmar Holi Festival] Lane Turner, Boston.com,  (March 5, 2012)&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Traditionally, washable natural plant-derived colours such as [[turmeric]], [[neem]], [[Butea monosperma|dhak]], and [[kumkum]] were used, but water-based commercial pigments are increasingly used. All colours are used. Everyone in open areas such as streets and parks is game, but inside homes or at doorways only dry powder is used to smear each other's face. People throw colours and get their targets completely coloured up. It is like a [[water fight]], but with coloured water. People take delight in spraying coloured water on each other. By late morning, everyone looks like a canvas of colours. This is why Holi is given the name &quot;Festival of Colours&quot;.

Groups sing and dance, some playing drums and ''[[dholak]]''. After each stop of fun and play with colours, people offer [[gujiya]], [[mathri]], [[malpua]]s and other traditional delicacies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blog.zhdk.ch/idss/files/2013/07/final-presentation-Festival-Circle.pdf Holi Festival] Rex Li Indrajeet Deshmukh and Marielle Roth, Festival Circle, IDSS 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Cold drinks, including adult drinks based on local intoxicating herbs,&lt;ref name=TOIBhang /&gt; are also part of the Holi festivity.

;Other variations
[[File:HOLI CELEBRATION AT NAGAON.jpg|thumb|Friends form groups on Holi, play drums and music, sing and dance, as they move from one stop to another.]]
In the Braj region around Mathura, in north India, the festivities may last more than a week. The rituals go beyond playing with colours, and include a day where men go around with shields and women have the right to playfully beat them on their shields with sticks.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ibtimes.co.in/articles/449244/20130322/holi-2013-celebrations-begin-lathmar-photos-mathura.htm Holi 2013] Ankita Mehta, International Business Times, (22 March 2013)&lt;/ref&gt;

In south India, some worship and make offerings to Kaamadeva, the love god of Indian mythology, on Holi.

;The after party
After a day of play with colours, people clean up, wash and bathe, sober up and dress up in the evening and greet friends and relatives by visiting them and exchanging sweets. Holi is also a festival of forgiveness and new starts, which ritually aims to generate harmony in the society.&lt;ref name=htor/&gt;

==Regional names, rituals and celebrations==
''Holi'' ({{Lang-hi|होली}}, {{Lang-ne|होली}}, {{Lang-pa|ਹੋਲੀ}}) is also known as '''''Phakuwa''''' or '''''Phagwah''''' ({{Lang-as|ফাকুৱা}}), '''Festival of Colours''', or '''''Doḷajātra''''' in [[Odisha]], and as '''''Dol Jatra''''' ({{Lang-as|দ’ল যাত্ৰা}}) or '''''Basantotsav''''' (&quot;spring festival&quot;) in [[West Bengal]] and [[Assam]]. The customs and celebrations vary between regions of India.

Holi is of particular significance in the [[Braj]] region, which includes locations traditionally associated with the [[Lord Krishna]]: [[Mathura, Uttar Pradesh|Mathura]], [[Vrindavan]], [[Nandgaon, Uttar Pradesh]], and [[Barsana]], which become touristic during the season of Holi.&lt;ref name=ind/&gt;

Outside India, Holi is observed by the minority Hindus in [[Bangladesh]] and [[Pakistan]] as well in countries with large Indian subcontinent [[diaspora]] populations such as [[Suriname]], [[Guyana]], [[Trinidad and Tobago]], [[South Africa]], [[Malaysia]], the [[United Kingdom]], the [[United States]], [[Canada]], [[Mauritius]], and [[Fiji]]. The Holi rituals and customs outside South Asia also vary with local adaptations.

===India===
;[[Gujarat]]
[[File:Holi (1).JPG|thumb|&quot;[[Festival|Celebration]] of Spring by [[Krishna]] and [[Radha]]&quot;, 18th-century [[Miniature (illuminated manuscript)|miniature]]; in the [[Guimet Museum]], [[Paris]]]]
In Gujarat, Holi is a two-day festival. On the evening of the first day people light the bonfire. People offer raw coconut and corn to the fire. The second day is the festival of colour or &quot;Dhuleti&quot;, celebrated by sprinkling coloured water and applying colours to each other. [[Dwarka]], a coastal city of Gujarat, celebrates Holi at the Dwarkadheesh temple and with citywide comedy and music festivities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pndwarka.com/news.html Holi in Dwarka]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Holi celebration has its celebrative origins in Gujarat,{{citation needed|date=November 2013}} particularly with dance, food, music, and coloured powder to offer a spring parallel of Navratri, Gujarat's Hindu festival celebrated in the fall. Falling in the Hindu month of ''Phalguna'', Holi marks the agricultural season of the [[rabi crop]].

In [[Ahmedabad]] in [[Gujarat]], in western India, a pot of buttermilk is hung high over the streets and young boys try to reach it and break it by making human pyramids. The girls try to stop them by throwing coloured water on them to commemorate the pranks of Krishna and the cowherd boys to steal butter and &quot;[[gopi]]s&quot; while trying to stop the girls. The boy who finally manages to break the pot is crowned the Holi King. Afterwards, the men, who are now very colourful, go out in a large procession to &quot;alert&quot; people of Krishna's possible appearance to steal butter from their homes.

In some places there is a custom in undivided Hindu families that the woman beats her brother-in-law with a sari rolled up into a rope in a mock rage, and try to drench him with colours, and in turn, the brother-in-law brings sweets (Indian desserts) to her in the evening.&lt;ref&gt;[http://topnews.in/law/files/Holi_3_0.jpg topnews.in], Holi in Gujarat&lt;/ref&gt;

;[[Uttar Pradesh]]
{{See also|Lath mar Holi}}
[[File:Samaj gathering during Lathmar hoil.jpg|thumbnail|right|Color Drenched Gopis in Krishna Temple, Mathura]]

[[Barsana]], a town near [[Mathura, Uttar Pradesh|Mathura]] in the [[Braj]] region of Uttar Pradesh, celebrates [[Lath mar Holi]] in the sprawling compound of the Radha Rani temple. Thousands gather to witness the Lath Mar Holi when women beat up men with sticks as those on the sidelines become hysterical, sing Holi songs and shout &quot;Sri Radhey&quot; or &quot;Sri Krishna&quot;. The Holi songs of Braj mandal are sung in pure Braj, the local language. Holi celebrated at [[Barsana]] is unique in the sense that here women chase men away with sticks. Males also sing provocative songs in a bid to invite the attention of women. Women then go on the offensive and use long staves called [[lathi]]s to beat the men, who protect themselves with shields.

Mathura, in the Braj region, is the birthplace of Lord [[Krishna]]. In [[Vrindavan]] this day is celebrated with special [[Puja (Hinduism)|puja]] and the traditional custom of worshipping Lord Krishna; here the festival lasts for sixteen days.&lt;ref name=ind&gt;[http://www.indiaexpress.com/rangoli/holi.html Holi&amp;nbsp;– the festival of colours] Indian Express.&lt;/ref&gt; All over the Braj region &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jagran.com/spiritual/religion-so-drop-colors-holi-brij-lal-was-11169083.html?src=HP-REL-ART|title=So drop colors - Holi, Brij Lal was|date=19 March 2014|work=jagran}}&lt;/ref&gt; and neighboring places like [[Hathras]], [[Aligarh]], and [[Agra]], Holi is celebrated in more or less the same way as in Mathura, [[Vrindavan]] and Barsana.

Outside Braj, in the [[Kanpur]] area, Holi lasts seven days with colour. On the last day, a grand fair called ''Ganga Mela'' or the ''Holi Mela'' is celebrated. This ''Mela'' ([[fair]]) was started by freedom fighters who fought British rule in the [[First Indian War of Independence]] in 1857 under the leadership of [[Nana Saheb]]. The ''Mela'' is held at various [[ghats]] along the banks of the River [[Ganges|Ganga]] in Kanpur, to celebrate the Hindus and Muslims who together resisted the [[United Kingdom|British]] forces in the city in 1857. On the eve of Ganga Mela, all Government offices, shops, Courts generally remain closed. The Ganga Mela marks the official end of &quot;The Festival of Colours&quot; or Holi in [[Kanpur]].

In [[Gorakhpur]], the northeast district of Uttar Pradesh, this day starts with a special [[puja (Hinduism)]] in the morning of Holi day. This day is considered to be the most colourful day of the year, promoting brotherhood among the people. This is known as &quot;Holi Milan&quot; in which people visit every house and sing Holi songs and express their gratitude by applying coloured powder ([[Abir|Abeer]]). Holi is also considered as the beginning of the year as it occurs on the first day of the Hindu calendar year (Panchang).

{{Main|Kumauni Holi}}
[[Kumaoni people|Kumaoni]] Holi in [[Uttarakhand]] includes a musical affair. It takes different forms such as the Baithki H
oli, the Khari Holi and the Mahila Holi. In Baithki Holi and Khari Holi, people sing songs with a touch of melody, fun and spiritualism. These songs are essentially based on classical [[raga]]s. Baithki Holi (बैठकी होली), also known as ''Nirvan Ki Holi'', begins from the premises of temples, where ''Holiyars'' (होल्यार) sing Holi songs and people gather to participate, along with playing classical music. The songs are sung in a particular sequence depending on the time of day; for instance, at noon the songs are based on Peelu, Bhimpalasi and Sarang ragas, while evening songs are based on the ragas such as Kalyan, Shyamkalyan and Yaman. The '''Khari Holi''' (खड़ी होली) is mostly celebrated in the rural areas of Kumaon. The songs of the Khari Holi are sung by the people, who, sporting traditional white ''[[churidar |churidar payajama]]'' and ''[[kurta]]'', dance in groups to the tune of ethnic musical instruments such as the ''[[dhol]]'' and ''[[hurka]]''.

In Kumaon region, the Holika pyre is known as ''Cheer'' (चीर,) which is ceremonially made in a ceremony known as ''Cheer Bandhan'' (चीर बंधन) fifteen days before Dulhendi. The ''Cheer'' is a bonfire with a green ''Paiya'' tree branch in the middle. The ''Cheer'' of every village and neighborhood is rigorously guarded as rival ''[[mohalla]]s'' try to playfully steal each other's ''cheer''.

The colours used on Holi are derived from natural sources. Dulhendi, known as ''Charadi'' (छरड़ी) (from ''Chharad'' (छरड़)), is made from flower extracts, ash and water. Holi is celebrated with great gusto much in the same way all across North India.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.euttaranchal.com/culture/fairs_festivals/kumaoni_holi.php Kumaoni Holi&amp;nbsp;– Uttaranchal Fairs and Festivals].

;[[Bihar]]
Holi is known as ''Phaguwa'' in the local [[Bhojpuri]] dialect. In this region as well, the legend of Holika is prevalent. On the eve of Phalgun Poornima, people light bonfires. They put dried cow dung cakes, wood of the Araad or Redi tree and Holika tree, grains from the fresh harvest and unwanted wood leaves in the bonfire. At the time of Holika people assemble near the fire. The eldest member of the gathering or a [[purohit]] initiates the lighting. He then smears others with colour as a mark of greeting. Next day the festival is celebrated with colours and a lot of frolic. Traditionally, people also clean their houses to mark the festival.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}

Holi Milan is also observed in Bihar, where family members and well wishers visit each other's family, apply colours ([[abir|abeer]]) on each other's faces, and on feet, if elderly. Usually this takes place on the evening of Holi day after Holi with wet colours is played in the morning through afternoon. Due to large scale internal migration issues faced by the people, recently this tradition has slowly begun to transform. It is common to have Holi Milan on an entirely different day either before or after the actual day of Holi.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}

Children and youths take extreme delight in the festival. Though the festival is usually celebrated with colours, in some places people also enjoy celebrating Holi with water solutions of mud or clay. Folk songs are sung at high pitch and people dance to the tune of dholak and the spirit of Holi. Intoxicating [[bhang]], made from [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]], milk and spices, is consumed with a variety of mouth-watering delicacies, such as [[pakora]]s and [[thandai]], to enhance the mood of the festival.&lt;ref name=HuffPostBhang&gt;{{cite web|title=Holi 2014: Festival Of Colors Celebrates Spring (SONGS, PHOTOS)|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/03/16/holi-2014_n_4965026.html|work=[[Huffington Post]]|accessdate=17 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In West Bengal, Holi is known by the name of &quot;Dol Jatra&quot;, &quot;Dol Purnima&quot; or the &quot;Swing Festival&quot;. The festival is celebrated in a dignified manner by placing the icons of Krishna and [[Radha]] on a picturesquely decorated [[palanquin]] which is then taken round the main streets of the city or the village. On the [[Dol Purnima]] day in the early morning, students dress up in saffron-coloured or pure white clothes and wear garlands of fragrant [[flowers]]. They sing and dance to the accompaniment of musical instruments like [[ektara]], dubri, [[veena]], etc. The devotees take turns to swing them while women dance around the swing and sing devotional songs.

==Traditional Holi==
[[File:Dhak (Butea monosperma) flowers in Kolkata W IMG 4219.jpg|left|thumb|Flowers of Dhak or [[Palash]] are used to make traditional colours]]
The spring season, during which the weather changes, is believed to cause viral fever and cold. The playful throwing of natural coloured powders has a medicinal significance: the colours are traditionally made of [[Neem]], [[Kumkum]], [[Turmeric|Haldi]], [[Bilva]], and other medicinal herbs prescribed by [[Ayurveda|Āyurvedic]] doctors.

Many colours are obtained by mixing primary colours. Artisans produce and sell many of the colours from natural sources in dry powder form, in weeks and months preceding Holi. Some of the traditional natural plant based sources of colours are:&lt;ref name=&quot;keholi&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.holifestival.org/holi-natural-colors.html Holi colors] Society for the Confluence of Festivals in India (2009)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.purcolour.com/faq/gulalholi-faq Celebration powders (Gulal/Holi)] Purcolor (2010)&lt;/ref&gt;
;Orange and red
The flowers of [[Butea monosperma|palash]] or tesu tree, also called the flame of the forest, are typical source of bright red and deep orange colours. Powdered fragrant red sandal wood, dried hibiscus flowers, madder tree, radish and pomegranate are alternate sources and shades of red. Mixing lime with turmeric powder creates an alternate source of orange powder, as does boiling saffron (kesar) in water.

;Green
[[Mehndi|Mehendi]] and dried leaves of gulmohur tree offer a source of green colour. In some areas, the leaves of spring crops and herbs have been used as source of green pigment.

;Yellow
[[File:Holi shop.jpg|thumb|Colours for Holi on sale at a market in [[Mysore]].]]
''Haldi'' ([[turmeric]]) powder is the typical source of yellow colour. Sometimes this is mixed with chickpeas, gram or other flour to get the right shade. Bael fruit, amaltas, species of chrysanthemums, and species of marigold are alternate sources of yellow.

;Blue
[[Indigo]], Indian berries, species of grapes, blue hibiscus and [[jacaranda]] flowers are traditional sources of blue colour for Holi.

;Magenta and purple
[[Beetroot]] is the traditional source of magenta and purple colour. Often these are directly boiled in water to prepare coloured water.

;Brown
Dried [[Tea#Preparation|tea]] leaves offer a source of brown coloured water. Certain clays are alternate source of brown.

;Black
Species of grapes, fruits of [[Phyllanthus emblica|amla]] (gooseberry) and vegetable carbon (charcoal) offer gray to black colours.

===Synthetic colours===
[[File:Young man celebrating Holi.JPG|thumb|A young man celebrating Holi]] 
Natural colours were used in the past to celebrate Holi safely by applying [[turmeric]], [[sandalwood]] paste, extracts of flowers and leaves. As the spring-blossoming trees that once supplied the colours used to celebrate Holi have become more rare, chemically produced industrial dyes have been used to take their place in almost all of urban India. Due to the commercial availability of attractive pigments, slowly the natural colours are replaced by synthetic colours. As a result, it has caused mild to severe symptoms of skin irritation and inflammation. Lack of control over the quality and content of these colours is a problem, as they are frequently sold by vendors who do not know their origin.

A 2007 study found that [[malachite green]], a synthetic bluish-green dye used in some colours during Holi festival, as responsible for severe eye irritation in Delhi, if eyes were not washed upon exposure. Though the study found that the pigment did not penetrate through the cornea, malachite green is of concern and needs further study.&lt;ref&gt;Velpandian et al.

]] problems to some people in the days following Holi. These colours are produced in India, particularly by small informal businesses, without any quality checks and are sold freely in the market. The colours are sold without labeling, and the consumer lacks information about the source of the colours, their contents, and possible toxic effects. In recent years, several nongovernmental organisations have started campaigning for safe practices related to the use of colours. Some are producing and marketing ranges of safer colours derived from natural sources such as vegetables and flowers.&lt;ref&gt;Ghosh, S. K., Bandyopadhyay, D., Chatterjee, G., &amp; Saha, D. (2009), The ‘holi’dermatoses: Annual spate of skin diseases following the spring festival in India, Indian journal of dermatology, 54(3), 240&lt;/ref&gt;

These reports have galvanised a number of groups into promoting more natural celebrations of Holi. Development Alternatives, Delhi and Kalpavriksh,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kalpavriksh.org/f1/f1.4/GAholi1 The safe Holi campaign] – Kalpavriksh Environment Action Group, Pune&lt;/ref&gt; Pune, The CLEAN India campaign&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cleanindia.org/btonature/holi.htm CLEAN India campaign] {{wayback|url=http://www.cleanindia.org/btonature/holi.htm |date=20130423111307 |df=y }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Society for Child Development, through its Avacayam Cooperative Campaign&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sfcdindia.org |title=Society For Child Development |publisher=Sfcdindia.org |date= |accessdate=2013-09-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; have launched campaigns to help children learn to make their own colours for Holi from safer, natural ingredients. Meanwhile, some commercial companies such as the National Botanical Research Institute have begun to market &quot;herbal&quot; dyes, though these are substantially more expensive than the dangerous alternatives. However, it may be noted that many parts of rural India have always resorted to natural colours (and other parts of festivities more than colours) due to availability.

In urban areas, some people wear nose mask and sun glasses to avoid inhaling pigments and to prevent chemical exposure to eyes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.taelon.co.uk/holi-festival/ Holi Festival] What to wear? UK (2012)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Environmental impact===
An alleged environmental issue related to the celebration of Holi is the traditional Holika bonfire, which is believed to contribute to deforestation. Activists estimate Holika causes 30,000 bonfires every year, with each one burning approximately 100 kilograms of wood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/articleshow/40597284.cms | work=[[The Times Of India]] | title=No real attempt to save trees | date=2003-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; This represents less than 0.0001% of 350 million tons of wood India consumes every year, as one of the traditional fuels for cooking and other uses.&lt;ref&gt;Swaminathan and Varadharaj, [http://www.iufro.org/download/file/3514/4376/20903-losbanos2001-3_pdf/ The status of firewood in India], IUFRO Symposium Proceedings (2003), pp 150-156&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of heavy metal-based pigments during Holi is also reported to cause temporary [[wastewater]] pollution, with the water systems recovering to pre-festival levels within 5 days.&lt;ref&gt;Tyagi, V. K., Bhatia, A., Gaur, R. Z., Khan, A. A., Ali, M., Khursheed, A., &amp; Kazmi, A. A. (2012), Effects of multi-metal toxicity on the performance of sewage treatment system during the festival of colours (Holi) in India, Environmental monitoring and assessment, 184(12), pp 7517-7529&lt;/ref&gt;

===Flammability===
Dry agricultural products-based holi powder such as colored corn starch, under certain conditions, can ignite.&lt;ref name=DeadlyPowderBBC/&gt;

In June 2015, hundreds of concert-goers in [[Bali District]], [[Taiwan]] were severely injured in the [[Formosa Fun Coast explosion]], including fifteen who died later in hospital,&lt;ref name=&quot;Victim&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=Months after water park fire, 15th burn victim dies |url=http://focustaiwan.tw/news/asoc/201511290009.aspx |accessdate=December 28, 2015 |agency=Focus Taiwan News Channel |date=November 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; after three tons of corn starch powder mixed with food coloring was sprayed onto the crowd at a high velocity, causing a massive explosion.&lt;ref name=NYT&gt;{{cite news|last1=Forsythe|first1=Michael|title=Hundreds Treated for Burns After Fire at Taiwan Water Park|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/29/world/asia/party-at-taiwan-water-park-erupts-in-flames-injuring-hundreds.html?_r=0|website=New York Times|accessdate=29 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The method of powder application at the concert created &quot;an extremely dense dust cloud over the stage and its immediate vicinity&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Taiwan Water Park Explodes, Injuring At Least 229 People Attending A ‘Color Play’ Party; Dust Explosion Was Likely Cause|url=http://www.ibtimes.com/taiwan-water-park-explodes-injuring-least-229-people-attending-color-play-party-dust-1986851|website=International Business Times|author=Angelo Young|accessdate=11 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; people near the stage were standing ankle deep in colored corn starch powder and the powder was suspended into the air using air blowers as well as compressed gas canisters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Heavy dust, heat source may have caused explosion, says official|date=30 June 2015|url= http://www.chinapost.com.tw/taiwan/national/national-news/2015/06/30/439570/Heavy-dust.htm|website=The China Post, Taiwan|accessdate=11 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Water Park Inferno: Details of pre-blaze conditions emerge | website=Taipei Times | date=2015-06-30 | url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/front/archives/2015/06/30/2003621906 | accessdate=2015-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initial investigations into the explosion showed the ignition of the suspended corn starch powder was likely caused by a cigarette or spark. An Asia One report&lt;ref name=DeadlyPowderBBC/&gt; states that such an explosion can occur, under certain conditions, not just with corn starch but with powder form of any agricultural product such as &quot;powdered milk, soya flour, cornflour, rice dust, spice powders, sugar, tapioca, cocoa powder, coconut shell dust, coffee dust, garlic powder, grass dust, malted hops, lemon peel dust, oat flour, peanut skins, tea and tobacco&quot;, and that &quot;the crucial element is not the composition of the powder itself, but whether it's deployed under high pressure with a flame nearby.&quot;&lt;ref name=DeadlyPowderBBC&gt;{{cite web|title=When Powders Turn Deadly|url=http://news.asiaone.com/news/asia/when-powders-turn-deadly|website=Asia One|accessdate=11 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Williamson, flammable powder or dust suspended in air in high concentrations is [[dust explosion|explosive]].&lt;ref name=DeadlyPowderBBC/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Introduction to Dust Explosions |accessdate=2006-10-29 |last=Williamson |first=George |date=2002 |url=http://www.chemeng.ed.ac.uk/~emju49/SP2001/webpage/index.html |archivedate=23 December 2004 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041223145242/http://www.chemeng.ed.ac.uk/~emju49/SP2001/webpage/index.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; Williamson notes that &quot;dust cloud explosions can only occur if the dust concentration is within certain limits. In general the lowest concentration of dust that can give a dust explosion is around 50-100 g/m3 and the maximum is 2-3 kg/m3. These limits are dependent on the particular chemical in question. It is usually easy to see if a cloud is explosible, as visibility through a dust cloud - even at the lowest concentrations - is impaired.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Introduction to Dust Explosions - concentration range |accessdate=2006-10-29 |last=Williamson |first=George |date=2002 |url=http://www.chemeng.ed.ac.uk/~emju49/SP2001/webpage/index.html |archivedate=23 December 2004 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041223145242/http://www.chemeng.ed.ac.uk/~emju49/SP2001/webpage/index.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During traditional Holi celebrations in India, Rinehart writes, colors are exchanged in person by &quot;tenderly applying colored powder to another person's cheek&quot;, or by spraying and dousing others with buckets of colored water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Rinehart | first=Robin | title=Contemporary Hinduism ritual, culture, and practice | year=2004 | isbn=978-1-57607-905-8 | page=137}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Holi-inspired events===
A number of Holi-inspired social events have also surfaced, particularly in Europe and the United States, often organized by companies as for-profit or charity events with paid admission, and with varying scheduling that does not coincide with the actual Holi festival. These have included Holi-inspired [[music festival]]s such as the [[Festival Of Colours Tour]] and Holi One (which feature timed throws of Holi powder), and [[5K run]] franchises such as [[The Color Run]] and Color Me Rad, in which participants are doused with the powder at per-kilometre checkpoints.&lt;ref name=sanjosecom-colormerad&gt;{{cite web|title=Color Me Rad 5K Run|url=http://www.sanjose.com/2012/08/27/color_me_rad_5k_run/|website=SanJose.com|accessdate=6 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=colorrun-aljazeera&gt;{{cite news|title=Hindu Holi festival shows its colours in UK|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2014/08/hindu-holi-festival-shows-colours-uk-201482295351137251.html|accessdate=6 March 2015|work=Al Jazeera}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=wsj-holifight/&gt;

{{Unreferenced|date=February 2011}}

A '''jersey''' is an item of [[knit]]ted [[clothing]], traditionally in [[wool]] or [[cotton]], with [[sleeve]]s, worn as a [[Sweater|pullover]], as it does not open at the front, unlike a [[Cardigan (sweater)|cardigan]]. It is usually close-fitting and machine knitted in contrast to a [[guernsey (clothing)|guernsey]] that is more often hand knit with a thicker [[yarn]]. The word is usually used interchangeably with [[sweater]].

==History==
[[Jersey]], in the [[Channel Islands]], was famous for its knitting trade in medieval times, and because of that original fame, the name jersey is still applied to many forms of knitted fabric, round or flat. The traditional jersey, and traditional [[Guernsey (clothing)|guernsey]], are dyed a navy blue colour, using a dye that does not require stripping the wool of its [[wool grease|natural oil]], rendering these sweaters surprisingly water resistant. The wool used in guernseys is often passed through oil in order to render it doubly water-resistant. {{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}

==In sports==
{{see also|Third jersey|Baseball uniforms|List of Major League Baseball retired numbers}}
Alternatively, a jersey as used in [[sport]] is a [[shirt]] worn by a member of a team, typically depicting the [[sportsperson|athlete]]'s name and team number as well as the [[logotype]] of the team or corporate sponsor. [[Cycling jersey]]s of specific colour or pattern represent certain statuses in [[cycling]], such as the [[maillot jaune]] (yellow jersey) of the leader of the [[Tour de France]], or the [[rainbow jersey]].  Cycling jerseys are usually made of synthetic [[microfiber]] material to aid in wicking sweat away from the skin to allow it to [[evaporate]].  The main garment of an [[ice hockey]] uniform, which was traditionally called a sweater, is increasingly known as a [[hockey jersey]]. This garment, along with [[basketball]] jerseys which are usually [[sleeveless]] and [[baseball]] jerseys which are usually button up, have become fashion accessories. A related term is &quot;[[Bib (garment)|bib]]&quot;, which may refer to a shirt (jersey, esp. in Britain), 

In some sports, such as [[ice hockey]], [[baseball]], [[basketball]], and various [[football]] codes, a player's jersey may be &quot;retired&quot;.  When a jersey is retired that player's jersey is placed usually where the team plays in honor of that player's accomplishment.  Generally, when a jersey is retired, the number on the player's jersey is made unavailable for future players.

[[File:Joss Bay, Broadstairs, England - Aug 2008.jpg|thumb|300px|Vacationers at the beach in [[Broadstairs]], [[Kent]]]]
A '''vacation''' or '''holiday''' is a [[leave of absence]] from a regular occupation, or a specific trip or journey, usually for the purpose of [[recreation]] or [[tourism]]. People often take a vacation during specific [[holiday]] observances, or for specific [[festival]]s or celebrations. Vacations are often spent with [[Friendship|friends]] or [[family]].

A person may take a longer break from work, such as a [[sabbatical]], [[gap year]], or [[career break]].

The concept of taking a vacation is a recent invention, and has developed through the last two centuries. Historically, the idea of travel for recreation was a luxury that only wealthy people could afford (see [[Grand Tour]]).  In the [[Puritan]] culture of early America, taking a break from work for reasons other than weekly observance of the Sabbath was frowned upon. However, the modern concept of vacation was led by a later religious movement encouraging  [[spiritual retreat]] and recreation. The notion of breaking from work periodically took root among the middle and working class.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=All Things Considered |url=http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=105545388 |title=The History Of The Vacation Examined |publisher=[[NPR]] |date=17 June 2009 |accessdate=2 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
In the [[United Kingdom]], ''vacation'' once specifically referred to the long summer break taken by the [[court|law courts]] and then later the term was applied to  universities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.postgrad.com/editorial/study-in-uk/uk-postgraduate-study/university-holidays/ |title=United Kingdom University Term Times and Vacations|date= |accessdate=2016-01-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The custom was introduced by [[William the Conqueror]] from [[Normandy]] where it facilitated the grape harvest.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}} In the past, many [[upper-class]] families moved to a [[summer home]] for part of the year, leaving their usual home vacant.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}

==Impact of digital communications==
{{Original research section|date=April 2015}}
Recent developments in communication technology—internet, mobile, instant messaging, presence tracking, etc.—have begun to change the nature of vacation. Vacation today means absence from the workplace rather than temporary cession of work. It is now the norm in North America and Great Britain to carry on working or remain on call while on vacation rather than abandon work altogether. Office employees [[telecommute]] whilst on vacation. Workers may choose to unplug for a portion of a day and thus create the feeling of a &quot;vacation&quot; by simply separating themselves from the demands of constant digital communications.  Antithetically, workers may take time out of the office to go on vacation, but remain plugged-in to work-related communications networks.  While remaining plugged-in over vacation may generate short-term business benefits, the long-term psychological impacts of these developments are only beginning to be understood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/wired-success/201205/why-it-s-so-hard-unplug-the-digital-world |title=Why It’s so Hard to Unplug From the Digital World |first=Ray |last=Williams |work=[[Psychology Today]] |date=6 May 2012 |accessdate=2 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Regional meaning==
{{See also|Tourism}}

''Vacation'', in English-speaking [[North America]], describes recreational [[travel]], such as a short pleasure trip, or a journey abroad. People in [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] countries use the term ''holiday'' to describe absence from work as well as to describe a vacation or journey. Vacation can mean either staying home or going somewhere.

[[Canada|Canadians]] often use ''vacation'' and ''holiday'' interchangeably referring to a trip away from home or time off work. In [[Australia]] and the [[UK]], ''holiday'' can refer to a vacation or a [[public holiday]].

The Vanderbilts, Rockefellers, Carnegies, Huntingtons and other fabulously wealthy industrialists built their own spectacular “great camps” in the Adirondacks of upstate NY where they could disport with their families in private luxury. The scions of New York City took to declaring that they would “vacate” their city homes for their lakeside summer retreats, and the term “vacation” replaced the British “holiday” in common parlance.

In [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]], the word ''vakáció'' can mean both a recreational trip, an officially granted absence from work (generally in warmer months), and the summer (longest) school break. For absence from work, the word ''szabadság'' (freedom/liberty) can be used, possibly as ''betegszabadság'' (sickness freedom/sickness liberty) when the reason of absence is medical in nature.

==Family vacation==
[[Family vacation]] refers to recreation taken together by the family.  The intended purpose of family vacation is for family to get away from day-to-day chores and to devote time specifically for the relaxation and unity of family members.  Family vacation can be ritual—for example, annually around the same time—or it can be a one-time event. It can involve travel to a far-flung spot or, for families on a tight budget, a stay-at-home staycation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.travelingmom.com/making-the-most-of-your-stress-free-budget-staycation/ |title=Making the most of your Stress-free, Budget Staycation |work=Traveling Mom |year=2015 |accessdate=2 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some examples of favorite family vacations&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.favoritefamilyvacations.com/top-ten-family-vacation-destinations.html |title=Top Ten Family Vacation Destinations |work=Favorite Family Vacations |year=2015 |accessdate=10 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; might include family cruises, trips to popular theme parks, ski vacations, beach vacations, or similar types of family trips.

Family vacation has become a common theme in many movies.

{{Wiktionary|convocation}}

A '''convocation''' (from the [[Latin]] ''[[wikt:convocare|convocare]]'' meaning &quot;to call/come together&quot;, a translation of the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] [[wikt:ἐκκλησία|ἐκκλησία]] ''ekklēsia'') is a group of people formally assembled for a special purpose, mostly ecclesiastical or academic.

==Ecclesiastical convocations==
A [[synod]]ical assembly of a church is at times called &quot;Convocation&quot;

===Convocations of Canterbury and York===
{{main|Convocations of Canterbury and York}}
The Convocations of [[Province of Canterbury|Canterbury]] and [[Province of York|York]] were the synodical assemblies of the two Provinces of the [[Church of England]] until the [[Church Assembly]] was established in 1920.&lt;ref name=&quot;odcc-conv1&quot;&gt;''Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church'' (1974) art. &quot;Convocations of Canterbury and York&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Their origins date back to the end of the seventh century when [[Theodore of Tarsus]] (Archbishop of Canterbury, 668-690) reorganized the structures of the English Church and established national synod of bishops. With the recognition of York as a separate province in 733, this synod was divided into two.&lt;ref name=&quot;odcc-conv1&quot;/&gt;  In 1225, representatives of the cathedral and monastic chapters were included for the first time and in 1285 the membership of the Convocation of Canterbury assumed the basic form which it retained till 1921: Bishops, Abbots (till the 1530s and the [[Dissolution of the Monasteries]]), Deans, and Archdeacons, plus one representative of each cathedral chapter and two for the clergy from each diocese.&lt;ref name=&quot;odcc-conv1&quot;/&gt;  By the fifteenth century, each convocation was divided into an upper house (the Bishops) and a lower house (the remaining members).&lt;ref name=&quot;odcc-conv1&quot;/&gt;  In 1921, the number of proctors (elected representatives) of the diocesan clergy was increased to make them a majority in the lower houses.

The Convocation of York was a relatively small part of the Church in [[England]] and [[Wales]] with only five member dioceses in Henry VIII's reign.&lt;ref group=n&gt;York, Durham, Carlisle, Chester, and Man. In medieval times there were only four: Galloway, York, Durham and Carlisle. (Kemp ''Counsel and Consent'' pp.247,248)  Only with the establishment of the Diocese of Ripon in 1836 did the number increase.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1462 it decided that all the provincial constitutions &lt;ref group=n&gt;''Ad hoc'' decisions  which amplified the canon law of the Western Church to meet local conditions.&lt;/ref&gt; of Canterbury which were not repugnant or prejudicial to its own should be allowed in the Northern Province&lt;ref name=&quot;CaC-0&quot;&gt;Kemp, Eric Waldram ''Counsel and Consent'' SPCK (1961) pp 111, 118 and 174 respectively&lt;/ref&gt; and by 1530 the Archbishop of York rarely attended sessions and the custom that York waited to see what Canterbury had decided and either accepted or rejected it was well established. The Convocation of York was, in practice, taking second place to that of Canterbury&lt;ref name=&quot;CaC-0&quot;/&gt; so much so that in 1852 the Archbishop of York [[Thomas Musgrave (bishop)|Thomas Musgrave]] stated that since the time of [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] the archbishop had only attended personally two sessions (in 1689 and 1708).&lt;ref name=&quot;CaC-0&quot;/&gt;

The legislative powers of the convocations varied considerably over the centuries.  Until 1664, they (not Parliament) determined the taxes to be paid by the clergy, but their powers in general were severely curtailed by [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] in 1532/4;&lt;ref group=n&gt;They could only meet at the royal pleasure; they needed royal permission to discuss and make canons; no action of theirs could go against the sovereign's prerogative, or the customs, laws and statues of the realm.&lt;/ref&gt; and from the time of the Reformation till 1965 they were summoned and dissolved at the same time as Parliament.&lt;ref name=&quot;odcc-conv1&quot;/&gt; Under Henry VIII and his successor [[Edward VI of England|Edward VI]] between 1534 and 1553 the Convocations were used as a source of clerical opinion but ecclesiastical legislation was secured by statute from Parliament.&lt;ref name=&quot;CaC&quot;&gt;Kemp, Eric Waldram ''Counsel and Consent'' SPCK (1961) pp 158 and 159 respectively&lt;/ref&gt;  Later between 1559 and 1641, Elizabeth I, James I and Charles I gave the force of law to decisions of Convocation without recourse to Parliament by letters patent under the great seal notably the [[Thirty-Nine Articles]] (1571) and the 141 Canons of 1603.&lt;ref name=&quot;CaC&quot;/&gt;

The Convocations were abolished during the Commonwealth but restored on the accession of Charles II in 1660 and they synodically approved the [[Book of Common Prayer]] which was imposed by the Act of Uniformity in 1662.&lt;ref name=&quot;CaC2&quot;&gt;Kemp, Eric Waldram ''Counsel and Consent'' SPCK (1961) pp 165; 166-7; 168-9 respectively&lt;/ref&gt; Formal sessions at the start of each parliament continued but no real business was discussed until after the Revolution of 1688 which brought William III and Mary II to the throne when attempts to include some of the Protestant dissenters met such resistance in the lower house that the government abandoned them and the Convocations resumed their purely formal meetings&lt;ref name=&quot;CaC2&quot;/&gt;

In 1697 [[Francis Atterbury]] published his ''Letter to a Convocation Man concerning the Rights, Powers and Privileges of that Body'' which, in essence, claimed that the Convocation was an estate of the realm like Parliament and that the lower clergy were being illegally disfranchised and denied its proper voice in government.&lt;ref&gt;Gibson, William ''The Church of England 1688-1832'' Routledge (2001) p. 71&lt;/ref&gt;  Business was resumed in 1701 and by the time Queen Anne died in 1714 draft canons and forms of service had been drawn up for royal assent.&lt;ref name=&quot;CaC2&quot;/&gt;  However, there was an inherent tension between the two houses, the lower house was mainly [[Tory]] in its politics and [[high church]] in its doctrine while the upper house was mainly [[Whig (British political party)|Whig]] and [[latitudinarian]] and therefore in favour of toleration for Protestant dissenters and their possible reincorporation into the Church of England and feelings ran high until in 1717 the session was prorogued by Royal Writ to avoid the censuring of Bp. Benjamin Hoadley by the lower house (see the [[Bangorian controversy]]) and with the exception of an abortive session in 1741 the Convocations met only for formal business at the beginning of each parliament until the middle of the nineteenth century when Canterbury (in 1852) and York (in 1861) began to discuss issues of the day.

The resumption of proper business was brought about by the political changes which had taken place some twenty years earlier.  Until the [[Great Reform Bill]] of 1832, Parliament had been theoretically an Anglican body,&lt;ref name=&quot;Angl&quot;&gt;Neill, Stephen. ''Anglicanism'', London Pelican(1960), p. 254 and 227 respectively&lt;/ref&gt; and many churchmen began argue that neither Parliament nor the bishops in the House of Lords expressed the mind of the Church as a whole&lt;ref name=&quot;VC1&quot;&gt;Chadwick, Owen. ''The Victorian Church I'' A&amp;C Black (1966) p. 309; 310; 311 respectively&lt;/ref&gt; In 1847 the routine session at the beginning of a new Parliament coincided with the polemical nomination of [[Renn Dickson Hampden|Dr Hampden]] to the see of Hereford.  The formal address to the Queen was debated for six hours and an amendment carried praying the Crown to revive the active powers of convocation.&lt;ref name=&quot;VC1&quot;/&gt; The driving force behind the campaign to achieve this was the London banker, Henry Hoare, who dedicated himself to the task.&lt;ref name=&quot;CaP1&quot;&gt;Carpenter, S.C. ''Church and People:1789-1889'' SPCK (1937) p.268&lt;/ref&gt; The opposition was formidable: half the clergy and most of the laity rejected the idea, many politicians were against it and the two archbishops—[[John Bird Sumner]] and Thomas Musgrave—had no desire to revive Convocation.&lt;ref name=&quot;VC1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;CaP1&quot;/&gt;  The legal basis of the resistance was the claim that convocation could only discuss such business as was expressly 
specified by the Crown. Over the next eight years it was established that it could debate and act provided it did not try to discuss or frame canons and that the archbishop could only prorogue (adjourn) a session with the consent of his fellow diocesans. In 1851, Canterbury received a petition, in 1853 it appointed committees and by 1855 archb. Sumner was convinced of the value of Convocation and those bishops who had opposed the revival were taking part positively in its debates.  Archb. Musgrave maintained his opposition until his death in 1860—he even locked the room where it was due to meet— and the Northern Convocation remained inactive until his successor took office.

The Convocations have always been exclusively clerical assemblies. However, in 1885 the Convocations agreed to the establishment of parallel Houses of Laity elected by the lay members of the diocesan conferences. These were not part of Convocation; they had no constitutional status and were merely advisory.&lt;ref name=&quot;Angl&quot;/&gt; At the beginning of the twentieth century, both Convocations together with their respective houses of laity began to meet as a Representative Council which however had no legal authority or position. This was superseded in 1920 by the [[Church Assembly]] which was given the right to propose measures to Parliament by the &quot;[[Church of England Assembly (Powers) Act 1919|Enabling Act of 1919]]&quot;. The Convocations still exist and their members constitute the two clerical houses of the [[General Synod of the Church of England|General Synod]] but, apart from some residual and formal responsibilities, all legal authority is now vested in the Synod which was established in 1970.

In some universities, the term &quot;convocation&quot; refers specifically to the entirety of the alumni of a college which functions as one of the university's representative bodies. Due to its inordinate size, the Convocation will elect a standing committee, which is responsible for making representations concerning the views of the alumni to the university administration. The convocation also, however, can hold general meetings, at which any alumnus can attend. The main function of the convocation is to represent the views of the alumni to the university administration, to encourage co-operation among alumni, especially in regard to donations, and to elect members of the University's governing body (known variously as the Senate, Council, Board, etc., depending on the particular institution, but basically equivalent to a board of directors of a corporation). The equivalent of the Convocation in the Scottish university system is the [[General Council (Scottish university)|General Council]].

In the [[University of Oxford]], Convocation was originally the main governing body of the University, consisting of all doctors and masters of the University, but it now comprises all graduates of the university and its only remaining function is to elect the Chancellor of the University and the [[Professor of Poetry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oua.ox.ac.uk/enquiries/congandconvfive.html|title=University Archives:A history of Congregation and Convocation, 5.

At [[Durham University]], Convocation consists of all the graduates of the University along with the Chancellor, Vice,-Chancellor, and Deputy Vice-Chancellor, the Pro-Vice-Chancellors, the heads of colleges, and all professors, readers, senior lecturers and lecturers. It has the power to discuss and make representations on &quot;any matter whatsoever relating to the University&quot; and appoints the Chancellor of the University, most recently Sir [[Thomas Allen (baritone)|Thomas Allen]] on 11 October 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.dur.ac.uk/university.calendar/volumei/statutes/|title=University Calendar : University Statutes - Durham University|work=dur.ac.uk|accessdate=19 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Convocation was established by the fundamental statue of the University in 1835 and then consisted of MAs and doctors &quot;of the three faculties&quot; at Oxford, Cambridge and [[Trinity College, Dublin|Dublin]] who were members of the University when the statue was passed and those afterwards admitted to the degrees of DD, DCL, MD or MS at Durham.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=wu.89094395191;view=1up;seq=471|title=The British magazine and monthly register of religious ... v.8 1835. - Full View  - HathiTrust Digital Library - HathiTrust Digital Library|work=HathiTrust|accessdate=19 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women were admitted to Convocation from 1913.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stmaryscollegesociety.co.uk/history/|title=History of the College|work=St Mary's College Society|accessdate=19 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[University of London]], convocation, between its establishment in 1858 and its abolition in 2003, consisted of the university's graduates who were involved in the university's governance. After 1900, convocation had the power to elect the chancellor.

At some universities and colleges (e.g. [[University of Chicago]], [[Cornell University]], [[Teachers College, Columbia University]], [[University of Illinois]], and most universities in [[Canada]] and [[India]]), [[graduation]] events are called &quot;convocations&quot;, as opposed to commencements in other universities. At the [[University of Toronto]], convocation events are held at a specific venue named [[Convocation Hall]]. At other universities such as [[Syracuse University]], [[University of Oklahoma]], and [[University of Utah]], graduation ceremonies consist of both a commencement and a convocation with the commencement being the larger, university-wide ceremony and the individual colleges presenting degrees at a convocation.

At other colleges such as [[The University of Rochester]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rochester.edu/studentlife/galleries/convocation-2010/|title=College Convocation 2010|work=rochester.edu|accessdate=19 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[University of Pennsylvania]], [[Georgetown University]], [[Boston College]], [[The University of Colorado at Boulder]], [[University of Cincinnati]], [[University of Florida]], [[California State University, East Bay]], [[Miami University]], [[The University of Minnesota]], [[The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill]], [[University of North Dakota]], [[Simpson College]], [[Stanford University]], [[Dartmouth College]], [[Mount Holyoke College]], [[The College of William and Mary]], [[University of Nebraska–Lincoln]], [[Scripps College]], [[The College of St. Scholastica]], [[The University of West Georgia]], [[Marymount University]], and [[William Paterson University of NJ]] convocation refers to a formal ceremony in which arriving freshmen are welcomed and may sign the College &quot;matricula&quot;, a ceremonial parchment that contains the names of all of the students and alumni.

New Zealand universities have ''courts of convocation'' by which all graduates elect representatives to the institutions' governing bodies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1963/0007/latest/whole.html |title=Massey University Act 1963 No 7 (as at 29 November 2010), Public Act – New Zealand Legislation  |work=legislation.govt.nz |year=2011 |quote=Court of Convocation |accessdate=30 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1963/0008/latest/whole.html |title=University of Waikato Act 1963 No 8 (as at 29 November 2010), Public Act – New Zealand Legislation |work=legislation.govt.nz |year=2011 |quote=Court of Convocation |accessdate=30 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1961/0051/latest/whole.html |title=Victoria University of Wellington Act 1961 No 51 (as at 29 November 2010), Public Act – New Zealand Legislation |work=legislation.govt.nz |year=2011 |quote=University District and Court of Convocation |accessdate=30 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1961/0052/latest/whole.html |title=Lincoln University Act 1961 No 52 (as at 29 November 2010), Public Act – New Zealand Legislation|work=legislation.govt.nz |year=2011 |quote=Court of Convocation |accessdate=30 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1961/0050/latest/whole.html |title=University of Auckland Act 1961 No 50 (as at 29 November 2010), Public Act – New Zealand Legislation|work=legislation.govt.nz |year=2011 |quote=University District and Court of Convocation |accessdate=30 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1961/0049/latest/whole.html |title=University of Canterbury Act 1961 No 49 (as at 29 November 2010), Public Act – New Zealand Legislation  |work=legislation.govt.nz |year=2011 |quote=University District and Court of Convocation |accessdate=30 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hip hop fashion''', also known as '''urban fashion''', is a distinctive style of [[clothing|dress]] originating from [[African American]], Latin and other inner city youth on the scene of [[New York City]] later followed by [[Los Angeles]], [[Houston]], [[Chicago]], [[Philadelphia]], the [[San Francisco Bay Area]], [[Detroit]], [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]], [[Virginia]], [[Atlanta]],  [[St. Louis]] and others. Each city contributed various elements to its overall style seen worldwide today. Hip hop [[fashion]] complements the expressions and attitudes of [[hip hop culture]] in general. Hip hop fashion has changed significantly during its history, and today, it is a prominent part of popular fashion as a whole across the world and for all ethnicities.

== Late 1970s to mid-1980s ==

In the late 1970s, established [[sportswear (activewear)|sportswear]] and fashion brands, such as [[Le Coq Sportif]], [[Kangol]], [[Adidas]] and [[Pro-Keds]] attached themselves to the emerging hip hop scene.

During the 1980s, hip-hop icons wore clothing items such as brightly colored name-brand [[tracksuit]]s, [[sheepskin]] and leather [[bomber jacket]]s,&lt;ref name=&quot;kitwana198&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Kitwana|first=Bakari|title=The Hip-Hop Generation: Young Blacks and the Crisis in African-American Culture|year=2005|publisher=Basic Civitas Books|location=New York|isbn=978-0-465-02979-2 |page=198}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[C&amp;J Clark|Clarks]] shoes,&lt;ref name=&quot;kitwana198&quot;/&gt; Britishers a. k. a. British Walkers and [[Sneaker (footwear)|sneakers]] (usually Pro-Keds, Puma, Converse's Chuck Taylor All-stars, and Adidas Superstars often with &quot;phat&quot; or oversized shoelaces). Popular haircuts ranged from the early-1980s [[Jheri curl]] to the early-1990s [[hi-top fade]] popularized by [[Will Smith]] (The Fresh Prince) and [[Christopher &quot;Kid&quot; Reid]] of [[Kid 'n Play]], among others.  Another trend in hip-hop clothing was pioneered by Dapper Dan in the early 1980s (est. 1982) with the adaptation and brandishing of high-net-worth fashion house brands such as Louis Vuitton, Fendi, and Gucci and logos in custom-designed tracksuits, jackets, mink coats.

Popular accessories included large eyeglasses (Cazals&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://shopping.guardian.co.uk/beauty/story/0,,1561369,00.html | work=The Guardian | location=London | title=Specs appeal | first=Lauren | last=Cochrane | date=2005-09-02 | accessdate=2010-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; ),&lt;ref name=&quot;kitwana198&quot; /&gt; Kangol [[bucket hat]]s,&lt;ref name=&quot;kitwana198&quot;/&gt; nameplates,&lt;ref name=&quot;kitwana198&quot;/&gt; name belts,&lt;ref name=&quot;kitwana198&quot;/&gt; and multiple rings. Heavy gold jewelry was also popular in the 1980s; heavy jewelry in general would become an enduring element of hip hop fashion.&lt;ref name=&quot;keyes152&quot;&gt;Keyes, p. 152.&lt;/ref&gt; In general, men's jewelry focused on heavy gold chains and women's jewelry on large gold earrings.&lt;ref name=&quot;keyes152&quot;/&gt; Performers such as [[Kurtis Blow]] and [[Big Daddy Kane]] helped popularize gold necklaces and other such jewelry, and female rappers such as [[Roxanne Shanté]] and the group [[Salt-N-Pepa]] helped popularize oversized gold [[door-knocker earrings]]. The heavy jewelry was suggestive of prestige and wealth, and some have connected the style to Africanism.&lt;ref&gt;MC [[Schoolly D]], for instance, claimed that wearing gold &quot;is not something that was born in America. This goes back to Africa. The gold chains are basically for warriors. &quot;The artists in the rap field are battling. We're the head warrior. We got to stand up and say we're winning battles, and this is how we're doing it. &quot; Quoted in Keyes, p.&amp;nbsp;152 (quoting Schoolly D. [http://books.google.com/books?id=ozV_Wa_c470C&amp;lpg=PA52&amp;ots=nFx8AaiGYQ&amp;dq=The%20Meaning%20of%20Gold%20Schoolly%20D&amp;pg=PA52#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false &quot;The Meaning of Gold. &quot;] ''Spin'' (October 1988), p.&amp;nbsp;52).&lt;/ref&gt;

1980s hip hop fashion is remembered as one of the most important elements of [[old school hip hop]], and it is often celebrated in [[nostalgia|nostalgic]] hip hop songs such as [[Ahmad (rapper)|Ahmad]]'s 1994 single &quot;[[Back in the Day (Ahmad song)|Back in the Day]]&quot;, and [[Missy Elliott]]'s 2002 single also titled &quot;[[Back in the Day (Missy Elliott song)|Back in the Day]]&quot;.

[[Black nationalism]] was increasingly influential in [[Hip hop music|rap]] during the late 1980s, and fashions and hairstyles reflected [[African clothing|traditional African influences]].&lt;ref name=&quot;keyes152&quot; /&gt; Blousy [[Trousers|pants]] were popular among dance-oriented rappers like [[MC Hammer|M.C. Hammer]].&lt;ref name=&quot;keyes152&quot;/&gt; [[Fez (hat)|Fezzes]],&lt;ref name=&quot;keyes152&quot;/&gt; [[kufi]]s decorated with the [[Kemetic]] [[ankh]],&lt;ref name=&quot;keyes152&quot;/&gt; [[Kente cloth]] hats,&lt;ref name=&quot;keyes152&quot;/&gt; Africa chains, [[dreadlocks]], and Black Nationalist colors of red, black, and green became popular as well, promoted by artists such as [[Queen Latifah]], [[KRS-One]], [[Public Enemy (band)|Public Enemy]], and [[X-Clan]].

In the early 1990s, pop rappers such as [[Will Smith|The Fresh Prince]], [[Kid 'n Play]], and [[Left Eye]] of [[TLC (band)|TLC]] popularized [[baseball caps]] and bright, often [[neon]]-colored, clothing. TLC and late R&amp;B singer [[Aaliyah]] created a fashion trend among women. Wearing over-sized pants and big flannel shirts, they would couple the over-sized clothing with a tight shirt usually a sports bra underneath their big shirts. This was to show their own version of femininity, everything does not have to be form fitting and tight in order to be sexy.
[[Kris Kross]] also established the fad of wearing clothes backwards.&lt;ref name=&quot;keyes152&quot;/&gt; [[Kwamé]] sparked the brief trend of [[polka-dot]] clothing as well, while others continued wearing their mid-80s attire.

The [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]] capture of soon-to-be superstar basketball protege [[Michael Jordan]] from rivals Adidas in 1984 proved to be a huge turning point, as Nike dominated the urban streetwear [[athletic shoe|sneaker]] market in the late 1980s and early 1990s. {{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} Other clothing brands such as Reebok, Kangol, Fila, Champion, Carhartt, and Timberland were very closely associated with the hip hop scene, {{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} particularly on the East coast with hip hop acts such as Wu-Tang Clan and Gangstarr sporting the look.
Gangsta rap pioneers [[N.W.A]] popularized an early form of street Gangsta style in the late 1980s from the African American Gangs and Hustler clicks who were there, consisting of [[Dickies]] pants, white T-shirts, Locs sunglasses, [[Chuck Taylors]] sneakers, with black [[Oakland Raiders|Raiders]] snapback hats and Raiders [[Starter jacket]]s. Starter jackets, in addition, were also a popular trend in their own right during the late 1980s and early 1990s. They became something of a status-symbol, with incidents of robberies of the jackets reported in the media. {{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}

Hip hop fashion in this period also influenced high fashion designs. In the late 1980s, [[Isaac Mizrahi]], inspired by his elevator operator who wore a heavy gold chain, showed a collection deeply influenced by hip hop fashion.&lt;ref name=&quot;vibe280&quot;&gt;Wilbekin, p. 280.&lt;/ref&gt; Models wore black catsuits, &quot;gold chains, big gold nameplate-inspired belts, and black bomber jackets with fur-trimmed hoods. &quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;vibe280&quot;/&gt; Womenswear Daily called the look &quot;homeboy chic. &quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;vibe280&quot;/&gt; In the early 1990s, Chanel showed hip-hop-inspired fashion in several shows. In one, models wore black leather jackets and piles of gold chains.&lt;ref name=&quot;vibe280&quot;/&gt; In another, they wore long black dresses, accessorized with heavy, padlocked silver chains.&lt;ref name=&quot;vibe280&quot;/&gt; (These silver chains were remarkably similar to the metal chain-link and padlock worn by Treach of [[Naughty by Nature]], who said he did so in solidarity with &quot;all the brothers who are locked down. &quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;vibe280&quot;/&gt;) The hip hop trend, however, did not last; designers quickly moved on to new influences.&lt;ref name=&quot;vibe280&quot;/&gt;

== Mid-1990s to late 1990s fashion ==

=== Fashion among &quot;hip hop&quot; elites ===
The fashion years of hip hop
On the East Coast, members of the hip hop community looked back to the gangsters of the 1930s and 1940s for inspiration.&lt;ref name=&quot;vibe281&quot;&gt;Wilbekin, p. 281.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mafia|Mafioso]] influences, especially and primarily inspired by the 1983 remake version of ''[[Scarface (1983 movie)|Scarface]]'', became popular in hip hop. Many rappers set aside gang-inspired clothing in favor of classic [[gangster]] fashions such as [[bowler hat]]s,&lt;ref name=&quot;vibe281&quot;/&gt; double-breasted suits,&lt;ref name=&quot;vibe281&quot;/&gt; silk shirts,&lt;ref name=&quot;vibe281&quot;/&gt; and [[alligator]]-skin [[shoe]]s (&quot;gators&quot;).

This certain look transcended into the R&amp;B world in the mid 90s when [[Jodeci]] came onto the scene, who were crooners but with more edgy and sexual look. By wearing gangster style clothes along with the badboy attitude and being a R&amp;B group they appealed to both men and women. Particularly known for their baggy clothing, symbolising a hand me down from an older relative of a bigger build as a sign of toughness.

On the [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]], &quot;[[ghetto fabulous]]&quot; fashion (a term coined by [[Sean Combs]]) who was responsible for [[Jodeci]]'s look was on the rise.&lt;ref name=&quot;vibe281&quot;/&gt;

=== Urban streetwear ===

[[File:Slim Thug wearing a do-rag.jpg|thumb|200px|Rapper [[Slim Thug]] wearing a [[stocking cap]]]]

[[Tommy Hilfiger]] was one of the most prominent brand in 1990s sportswear, though [[Polo Ralph Lauren]], [[Calvin Klein]], [[Nautica (clothing company)|Nautica]], and [[DKNY]] were also popular.&lt;ref name=&quot;vibe282&quot;&gt;Wilbekin, p. 282.&lt;/ref&gt; When [[Snoop Dogg|Snoop Doggy Dogg]] wore a Hilfiger [[sweatshirt]] during an appearance on ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'', it sold out of New York City stores the next day.&lt;ref name=&quot;vibe282&quot;/&gt; Hilfiger's popularity was due to its perceived [[White Anglo-Saxon Protestant|waspiness]], which made it seem exclusive and aspirational.&lt;ref name=&quot;vibe282&quot;/&gt; Moreover, Hilfiger courted the new hip hop market: black models featured prominently in the company's advertising campaigns, and rappers like [[Sean Combs|Puffy]] and [[Coolio]] walked during its runways shows.&lt;ref name=&quot;vibe282&quot;/&gt;

[[Karl Kani]] was the first to set the trend of merging hip hop with fashion. By combining his two passions Karl started a whole new fashion movement and many designers followed in his footsteps. Growing up Karl Kani wondered &quot; Can I do it? Can I become the Ralph Lauren of the streets? Karl didn't have the answer for all these questions but it did provide the basis for his new name, Kani, a variation on &quot;Can I?&quot;. With a stylish &quot;K&quot; replacing the &quot;C&quot; in his first name, he ventured his own optimistic reply, Karl Kani.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.karlkani.com Karl Kani], 1989&lt;/ref&gt;

Other brands, such as Nike, [[Jordan]], [[FUBU]], Reebok [[Pro-Keds]], [[Adidas]], [[Ecko Unlimited]], [[Mecca USA]], [[Lugz]], [[Rocawear]], [[Boss Jeans]] by [[IG Design]], and [[Enyce]], arose to capitalize on the market for urban streetwear.

==== Throwback clothing ====

{{Original research|date=January 2010}}

One sportswear trend that emerged was the rise in popularity of [[throwback jersey]]s, such as those produced by [[Mitchell &amp; Ness]].
Sports jerseys have always been popular in hip-hop fashion, as evidenced by [[Will Smith]]'s early 90s video &quot;[[Summertime (DJ Jazzy Jeff and the Fresh Prince song)|Summertime]]&quot;, and [[Spike Lee]] wearing a throwback [[Brooklyn Dodgers]] jersey in the film &quot;[[Do the Right Thing]]. &quot; The late 90s saw the rise in popularity of very expensive throwbacks, often costing hundreds of dollars. Hip-hop artists donning the pricey jerseys in music videos led to increased demand, and led to the rise of counterfeiters flooding the market with fake jerseys to capitalize on the craze. The mid-to-late 2000s saw a decrease in popularity of throwbacks, with some hip-hop artists even shunning the raiments. In 1990 it was very big part for fashion because of all the hip hop artists that wore the various throwback jerseys.

The &quot;hip-pop&quot; era also saw the split between male and female hip hop fashion, which had previously been more or less similar. Women in hip hop had emulated the male tough-guy fashions such as [[baggy pants]], &quot;Loc&quot; sunglasses, tough looks and heavy workboots; many, such as [[Da Brat]], accomplished this with little more than some lip gloss and a bit of make-up to make the industrial work pants and work boots feminine. The female performers who completely turned the tide such as [[Lil' Kim]] and [[Foxy Brown (rapper)|Foxy Brown]] popularized glamorous, high-fashion feminine hip hop styles, such as [[Kimora Lee Simmons]] fashion line of [[Baby Phat]]. While [[Lauryn Hill]] and [[Eve (entertainer)|Eve]] popularized more conservative styles that still maintained both a distinctly feminine and distinctly hip hop feel.

=== Bling ===
{{Main|Bling Bling}}

In the mid to late 1990s, platinum replaced gold as the metal of choice in hip hop fashion.&lt;ref name=&quot;keyes152&quot;/&gt; Artists and fans alike wore platinum (or [[silver]] colored) jewelry, often embedded with [[diamond]]s. [[Juvenile (rapper)|Juvenile]], and [[The Hot Boys]] were largely responsible for this trend.&lt;ref name=&quot;keyes152&quot;/&gt; Platinum fronts also became popular; [[Cash Money Records]] executive/[[rapper]] [[Brian &quot;Baby&quot; Williams]] has an entire mouthful of permanent platinum teeth. Others have fashioned [[grills (cosmetic dental apparati)|grills]], removable metal jewelled teeth coverings.
With the advent of the Jewellery culture, the turn of the century established luxury brands made inroads into the hip hop market, with brands like [[Gucci]], [[Louis Vuitton]] and 212 Diamond City making appearances in hip hop videos and films.

== Modern Hip Hop fashion (2000s/10s Hip Hop fashion) ==
{{Original research|date=January 2010}}

[[File:Kanyecropped.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Kanye West]] performing in 2006 wearing a fitted [[sportcoat]]]]

In the 1990s and beyond, many hip hop artists and executives started their own fashion labels and clothing lines.&lt;ref&gt;Wilbekin, p. 283.&lt;/ref&gt; Notable examples include [[Wu-Tang Clan]] ([[Wu-Wear]]), [[Nelly]] ([[Vokal europe|Vokal]] and [[Apple Bottom Jeans]]), [[Russell Simmons]] ([[Phat Farm]]), [[Kimora Lee Simmons]] ([[Baby Phat]]), [[Sean Combs|Diddy]] ([[Sean John]] and [[Enyce]]), [[Clifford Harris|T.I.]] ([[A.K.O.O Clothing|AKOO]]), [[Damon Dash]] and [[Jay-Z]] ([[Rocawear]]), [[50 Cent]] ([[G-Unit]] Clothing), [[Eminem]] ([[Shady Records|Shady Limited]]), [[2Pac]] (Makaveli Branded), [[OutKast]] ([[OutKast Clothing]]) and [[Lil Wayne]] ([[Trukfit]]) Trukfit Model Conrad Epps (IG-@ConradEpps). Other prominent hip hop fashion companies have included Karl Kani, [[FUBU]], [[Eckō]], [[Marithé François Girbaud|Girbaud]], [[Enyce]], [[Famous Stars and Straps]], [[Bape]], [[Billionaire Boys Club (clothing retailer)|Billionaire Boys Club]], Beans, [[Ciara]], [[Erykah Badu]] ([[Starter Clothing Line]]), [[Lifted Research Group|LRG]], [[Akademiks]] and [[Southpole (clothing)|Southpole]] [[Heah Honcho]], [[Lil Wayne]] ([TRUKFIT)]

Up and coming urban clothing lines have dominated the fashion in the Hip-Hop genre. Baggy Pants and Skinny Low jeans also came into style due to New Boyz's jerk dance from the song &quot;[[You're a Jerk]]. &quot;

[[File:Commonrap.jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[Common (rapper)|Common]] wearing a [[t-shirt]] and [[Slim-fit pants|tight jeans]]]]

The hip hop fashion trends of the 2000s were all over the place and changed constantly, with the continue (balla) type image meaning extra baggy clothes, jerseys, and continue of bling. During these years there was a heavy celebrity influence among fashion trends. Hip Hop artists made brands like Gucci and Louis Vuitton popular amongst the hip hop community. Throughout these years many fashion trends from the 80s and early 90s were made popular again, such as the door knocker earring and form fitting jeans for males. Bright colors and cartoon graphic print hoodies by [[A Bathing Ape|Bathing Ape]] made popular by artist and producer Pharrell also gained popularity. Females could not get enough of high heels in all different forms and many ideas were crossed and we saw things like the open toed boot.&lt;ref&gt;[http://fashionbombdaily.com/2009/12/30/take-it-or-leave-it-top-fashion-trends-of-2009/]&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent years the hip hop world has seen a resurgence of old fads as well as the emergence of new ones. The last few years of the first decade of the new millennia gave rise to the popularity of tattoos covering artists from head to toe. [[Soulja Boy]], [[Wiz Khalifa]], [[Lil Wayne|Lil' Wayne]] and [[Tyga]] are all examples of artists that have set the trend of being completely &quot;tatted up. &quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.xxlmag.com/features/2009/12/ink-heads-hip-hop%E2%80%99s-most-off-the-dome-tattoo-addicts/ &quot;Ink Heads, Hip-Hop's Most Off the Dome Tattoo Addicts&quot;] xxlmag.com, December 1, 2009. Date accessed: May 9, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Although having tattoos is nothing new to the music industry, never have tattoos been so pervasive in the hip hop industry. Tattoos covering the face and the head have also become increasing popular. For example artists such as [[Birdman 'Baby' Williams]] now sports a star tattoo on the crown of his head, [[Gucci Mane]] proudly boasts an ice cream tattoo on his right cheek, and [[Lil Wayne]] on his eyelids and forehead.&lt;ref&gt;[http://rapfix.mtv.com/2011/02/23/lil-wayne-gucci-mane-and-game-a-journey-into-face-tattoos/ &quot;Lil Wayne, Gucci Mane And Game: A Journey Into Face Tattoos&quot;] rapflix.mtv.com, February 23, 2011. Date Accessed: May 9, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

One cannot speak of fashion trends without mentioning the importance of hair styles, particularly for women. In the past few years there has been a resurgence of the asymmetrical hair cut with a contemporary spin. Stars such as [[Rihanna]], [[Cassie Ventura|Cassie]] and [[Kelis]] have all dared to be different by setting the new trend of the half-shaven head.&lt;ref&gt;[http://s2smagazine. com/node/1346 &quot;Rihanna's shaved head for 'Italian Vogue'&quot;] s2smagazine.com, July 7, 2009. Date Accessed: May 10, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The reemergence of Adidas track jackets and the use of fashion scarves have been some of the latest trends to hit the hip hop fashion scene. Adidas track suits are certainly not new to hip hop culture as they have been around essentially since commercialized hip hop was created, however they have recently once again become popular. Fashion scarves have also become popularized in recent years. Kanye West is the most recent artist to launch his own line of products by selling decorative scarves with provocative depictions, named Risque Scarves.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.facebook.com/note.php?note_id=10150184221838959 &quot;Kanye West's Risque Scarf Line Coming Up&quot;] sojones.com, May 9, 2011. Date Accessed: May 10, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Skateboarding fashion has been used in the Hip-Hop scene since the early 2010s including Knit Caps, Bonnets, Fitted Pants or Shorts, [[Vans]], [[Nike SB]] (Skateboarding), Shirts with sleeves and Printed Tees (brands like OBEY, Supreme, Stussy, Adidas, Supra, Circa, [[DC Shoes|DC]], RDS and Emericas). [[Chris Brown (American singer)|Chris Brown]], [[Tyler The Creator]] &amp; [[Lil Wayne]] wear these on their music videos &amp; concerts.

The rebirth of the 90's Snapback Caps is the most notable sign of the New School Throwback Image. The &quot;New&quot; Snapback hype started around mid-2010. Around late-2010 and early-2011, the &quot;New&quot; Snapback movement exploded. [[Starter Clothing Line]] manufactured the most sought for Snapbacks in the 90's, and made its return in the Coming of Age as the hype for [[snapback (hat)|snapbacks]] grew, many of the well-known hat companies started to sell snapbacks, such as [[New Era Cap Company|New Era]], [[Mitchell &amp; Ness]], [[Reebok]], [[Adidas]], and many more companies followed suit. There are many notable artists are credited with the comeback of Snapbacks by sporting gear from a company named Ti$A VI$ION. [[Chris Brown (American singer)|Chris Brown]], [[Tyga]], and [[Big Sean]] are among the early supporters of this company since the Spring of 2010. Many urban fashionists credit [[Mac Miller]], a well-known [[YouTube]] MC, with starting the hype with the release of his song entitled &quot;Snap Back, &quot; which was on his mixtape ''The Jukebox: Prelude to Class Clown, '' released in June 2009. This was earlier before the &quot;New&quot; Snapback hype started to take root in Hip-Hop culture. Much controversy surrounds this topic of who started the &quot;New&quot; Snapback trend. It is enough to say that snapbacks now have an importance when it didn't matter back in the day. Modern hip hop fashion includes snapbacks, sports wear, basketball and skateboarding shoes, hoodies, piercings in one ear or both, leather jackets, sleevless shirts, polo shirts, saggy pants, bikini top for girls, crop tops, tube tops, tanks tops, factorie trackies and cropped T-shirts.

== Criticism of hip hop fashion ==

[[File:Cool Kids 008.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A [[Disc Jockey|DJ]] wearing a zip-up [[hoodie]] and checkerboard frame sunglasses.]]

Commentators from both inside and outside the hip-hop community have criticized the cost of many of the accoutrements of hip hop fashion. [[Chuck D]] of [[Public Enemy (band)|Public Enemy]] summarized the mentality of Hip hop fashion and some low-income youths as &quot;Man, I work at McDonald's, but in order for me to feel good about myself I got to get a gold chain or I got to get a fly car in order to impress a sister or whatever. &quot;&lt;ref&gt;Keyes, p. 172 (quoting Eure and Spady, 1991).&lt;/ref&gt; In his 1992 song &quot;Us&quot;, [[Ice Cube]] rapped that &quot;Us niggaz will always sing the blues / 'cause all we care about is hairstyles and tennis shoes&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Keyes, p. 173.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyMJABqGcTQ|accessdate=2 December 2011|title=Us Video}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mylyricscentral.com/lyrics/ice-cube/us.html|accessdate=2 December 2011|title=Us lyrics}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uulyrics.com/music/ice-cube/song-us/|accessdate=2 December 2011|title=Us lyrics}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some fans have expressed disappointment with the increased amount of advertising for expensive hip-hop brands in hip-hop magazines.&lt;ref name=&quot;keyes172&quot;/&gt; In one letter to the editor in Source magazine, a reader wrote that the magazine should &quot;try showing some less expensive brands so heads will know they don't have to hustle, steal, or rob and blast shots for flyness. &quot;&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Keyes, p. 172.&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, there were many highly publicized robberies of hip-hop artists by the late 1990s.&lt;ref name=&quot;keyes172&quot;/&gt; [[Guru (rapper)|Guru]] of [[Gang Starr]] was robbed of his Rolex watch at gunpoint, [[Queen Latifah]]'s car was car-jacked, and [[Prodigy (rapper)|Prodigy]] was robbed at gunpoint of $300,000 in jewelry.&lt;ref name=&quot;keyes172&quot;/&gt;

Hip-hop has sometimes come under fire for glorifying brands that shut it out and for embracing a fashion culture which does not embrace hip-hop or black culture.&lt;ref&gt;[http://live.huffingtonpost.com/r/segment/fashion-hip-hop-kanye-kimmel-classism-model-casting/525840f978c90a26c40004a5/ &quot;Is Fashion Racist?&quot;] Hufftington Post Live, October 16, 2013. Date accessed: December 8, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; There is a dichotomy that exists in the &quot;collaboration&quot; between influential hip-hop artists who embrace designer brands and fashions, and these same brands that profit from hip-hop's influencers.  Designer brands such as Louis Vuitton or Versace will show avaricious desire to align themselves with influential musicians because of the potential gains, but will simultaneously maintain  distance from these allies outside of advertising, &quot;almost as with a keen desire to hold the controlling hand in these relationships&quot; and control their public image.&lt;ref&gt;Miller, Janice. Fashion and Music. Oxford: Berg, 2011. Print.(Miller, 17)&lt;/ref&gt; In these partnerships/collaborations between designers and artists there is sometimes a pattern of exploitation in which the designers benefit disproportionately more than hip-hop artists.

A few hip hop insiders, such as the members of [[Public Enemy (band)|Public Enemy]], [[Immortal Technique]], [[Paris (rapper)|Paris]] and [[Common (rapper)|Common]] have made the deliberate choice not to don expensive jewelry as a statement against [[consumerism|materialism]].&lt;ref name=&quot;keyes172&quot;&gt;Keyes, p. 172.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Women in hip hop ==

Along with the turning of the tide by select female hip hop artists came the emergence of promoting sex appeal through fashion. Female artists have faced a number of pressures ranging from gaining exposure to further their careers as well as conforming with certain images to remain in demand and relevant. The alignment of [[rhythm and blues|R&amp;B]] music with hip-hop music (with collaborations being more and more prevalent) placed a whole new category of females within the categorization of what constituted a hip-hop artist.

As referenced above, the nineties decade centered around women's senses of style revolving around that of men in that they'd adopted the use of oversized T-shirts and baggy pants. Also listed above are [[Aaliyah]], [[TLC (band)|TLC]], and [[Da Brat|Da' Brat]] as conformists to that trend. Female rap group [[Salt-n-Pepa|Salt-N-Pepa]] are considered amongst the frontrunners in leading the transition of moving away from the male alignment and asserting feminism in creating a new sense of dress. They are said to have &quot;wowed fans while wearing hot pants, cut-off denim shorts and Lycra body suits&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hook|first=Sue Vander|title=Hip-Hop Fashion|year=2010|publisher=Capstone Press|location=Mankato, Minn.|isbn=978-1-4296-4017-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&quot;Black women's relationships to their bodies occur within overlapping cultural contexts that offer contradictory messages about their value and function&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lovejoy|first=Meg|title=Disturbances in the Social Body: Differences in Body Image and Eating Problems among African American and White Women|journal=Gender and Society|date=April 2001|volume=15|issue=2|jstor=3081846|pages=239–261|doi=10.1177/089124301015002005|url=http://gas.sagepub.com/content/15/2/239.abstract}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a male dominated society, it is no wonder that women used to work hard to align themselves with male images including how they'd dressed. As women generally gained access to and exposure within the offerings of several sectors of society, for example music, movies and television, we saw more images of what constituted attractiveness emerge. Following this came the perception of freedom to express oneself through several avenues including apparel. Rappers [[Lil' Kim]] and [[Eve (entertainer)|Eve]] are known for resorting to trends surrounding being scantily clad with provocative tattoos and being perceived as attractive in the process. Not all female rappers, or female artists in general have resorted to these methods within their careers. &quot;..the recent appearance of Black women performers, songwriters, and producers in Black popular culture has called attention to the ways in which young Black women use popular culture to negotiate social existence and attempt to express independence, self-reliance, and agency&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Emerson|first=Rana|title=&quot;Where My Girls At?&quot;: Negotiating Black Womanhood in Music Videos|journal=Gender and Society |date=February 2002 |volume=16|issue=1 |pages=115–135 |jstor=3081879 |doi=10.1177/0891243202016001007 |url=https://umdrive.memphis.edu/ajohnsn6/rhetoric%20of%20hip%20hop/where%20my%20girls%20at.pdf |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Nightwear''' &amp;ndash; also called '''sleepwear''', '''nightclothes''', or '''nightdress''' &amp;ndash; is [[clothing]] designed to be worn while [[sleep]]ing. The style of nightwear worn may vary with the seasons, with warmer styles being worn in colder conditions and ''vice versa''.

== Children's Nightwear ==

On 22 December 2011, the [[U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission]] (CPSC) issued a letter to manufacturers, distributors, importers and retailers reminding the apparel industry of the enforcement policy and their obligations associated with children’s sleepwear and loungewear.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cpsc.gov/businfo/sleepwearpolicy.pdf US CPSC – Sleepwear Policy and Loungewear Position Letter]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Commission’s regulations define the term ''children’s sleepwear'' to include any product of wearing apparel (in sizes 0-14), such as nightgowns, pajamas, or similar or related items, such as robes, intended to be worn primarily for sleeping or activities related to sleeping, except: (1) diapers and underwear; (2) ''infant garments'', sized for a child nine months of age or younger; and (3) ''tight-fitting garments'' that meet specific maximum dimensions.

All children’s sleepwear and loungewear sold in the US are required to comply with the Flammable Fabrics Act (FFA) using the standards for Flammability of Children’s Sleepwear 16 C.F.R. Parts 1615 and 1616. Moreover, they have to comply with the [[Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act|Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act of 2008 (CPSIA)]] requirements including tracking labels, a certificate of compliance, meeting requirements for lead content and surface coatings, and meeting requirements for phthalates.

{{Dress code (Western)}}
'''Formal wear''' (Canada, US) and '''formal dress''' (UK) are general terms for [[clothing]] suitable for formal social events, such as a [[wedding]], formal garden party or dinner, [[débutante]] [[cotillion]], dance, or race. The Western style of formal evening dress, characterised by black and white garments, has spread through many countries; it is almost always the standard formal social dress in countries without a formal [[national costume]].

A [[dress code (Western)|dress code]] is a set of rules governing a certain combination of clothing; some examples are [[black tie]] and [[morning dress]]. Formal dress is the grouping of all the dress codes which govern clothes worn to formal events. The traditional rules that govern men's formal dress are strictly observed; from these derive the evening dress variants worn on many occasions, such as high school [[prom]] dances, formal dances, and [[entertainment industry]] award programs.

The dress code considered formal in the evening is [[white tie]].  In the UK, morning dress is standard formal day time clothing (a [[lounge suit]] being still considered [[informal attire|informal dress]]), but in the US/Canada morning dress is rare, having been replaced with the [[stroller (style)|stroller]] and then the lounge, or business suit. Morning dress, however, does remain in certain settings in Europe, Australia, and Japan.

==Terminology: ''formal''==
[[File:Girl.in.Prom.Dress.1950s.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Girl in formal dress, [[United States of America|USA]], 1950s.]]
{{original research| section|date=May 2011}}{{unreferenced section|date=May 2011}}
The continual relaxation of formal dress standards since the end of the [[World War II|Second World War]] is redefining what clothes constitute formal and semi-formal dress.{{citation needed|date=May 2011}} The original term ''full dress'' was used in the 19th century and the early 20th century to mean the most formal option available, while half dress and undress ranked beneath it. They indicated different clothes, but correspond somewhat to the 21st-century structure of formal, semi-formal, and informal. These are the terms used by traditional etiquette and dress consultants (especially for weddings), while contemporary consultants use looser, modern definitions, in which white tie is styled as ''most formal'', ''very formal'' or ''ultra formal''; black tie as ''formal''; and the traditionally informal lounge suit as ''pseudo-formal''. Moreover, modern advisers recommend black tie for events traditionally considered to require formal dress (white tie), and alternatives for what would have been semi-formal events.

However, ''formal'' and ''semi-formal'' are unambiguous when it is known they are being used in a traditional setting, even though changing fashions can make these terms ambiguous; ''white tie'' and ''black tie'' on the other hand refer solely to the combination of relevant clothes themselves, regardless of their setting, and so are much less susceptible to misinterpretation.

Particularly in America, but also around the Western world, there has also been a relaxation regarding the dress codes themselves, with full formal dress (white tie or morning dress) almost unheard of in many places.

==Dress codes==
[[File:Man and Woman formal wear.jpg|thumb|left|Formal wear worn at a wedding]]
The dress codes counted as formal wear are the formal dress codes of [[white tie]] for evenings and [[morning dress]] for daytime. Although some consider [[black tie]] for the evening and [[stroller (style)|strollers]] for daytime, as formal, they are [[semi-formal]] attires, sartorially speaking.

The clothes dictated by these dress codes for women are [[ball gown]]s. For many uniforms, the official clothing is unisex.  Examples of this are [[court dress|law court dress]], [[Academic regalia|academic and graduate dress]], [[Dress uniform|formal military uniforms]] and [[Mess dress|formal military evening dress]].

===White tie===
{{Main|White tie}}

The required clothing for men, in the evening, is roughly the following: a (dress) [[tailcoat]]; formal [[trousers]], uncuffed, with stripes on leg seams; white [[Piqué (weaving)|piqué]] [[bow tie]]; white piqué [[vest]] (waistcoat); white piqué front or plain stiff-fronted [[shirt]] with a detachable wing collar; [[cuff links]] and [[shirt stud]]s; black [[patent leather]] [[court shoe]]; accessories.

Women wear a variety of dresses. See [[ball gown]]s, [[evening gown]]s, and [[wedding dress]]es. Business attire for women has a developmental history of its own and generally looks different from formal dress for social occasions.

===Morning dress===
{{Main|Morning dress}}
'''Morning dress''' is the daytime formal [[dress code (Western)|dress code]], consisting chiefly for men of a [[morning coat]], [[waistcoat]], and [[spongebag trousers|striped trousers]], and an appropriate [[dress]] for women.

In Western formal state ceremonies and social functions, diplomats, foreign dignitaries, and guests of honour wear Western formal dress if not wearing their own national dress.

Many cultures have formal evening and day dress, for example:
* [[Daura-Suruwal]] — worn as formal dress by men in [[Nepal]].
* [[Kilt#Scottish kilt|Scottish kilt]] — worn as formal dress by men in [[Scotland]] or of Scottish descent
* [[Bunad]] — worn as formal dress by women and men in [[Norway]].
* [[:sv:Svenska folkdräkter|Folkdräkt]] — worn as formal dress by women and men in [[Sweden]].
* [[Þjóðbúningurinn#Hátíðarbúningur|Hátíðarbúningur]] — worn by men in [[Iceland]] to formal events such as state dinners and weddings.
* [[Dhoti]] — worn by men in [[Pakistan]], [[India]], [[Bangladesh]], the [[Maldives]], and [[Sri Lanka]].
* [[Sari]] — worn by women in [[India]], [[Nepal]], [[Bangladesh]], [[Pakistan]] and [[Sri Lanka]].
* [[Shalwar kameez]] — worn by both men and women in [[Pakistan]], [[India]] and [[Bangladesh]].
* [[Sherwani]] worn by men in [[South Asia| India and Pakistan]]
* [[Dashiki]] — worn by men in West African countries.
* [[Barong Tagalog]] — worn by men in the Philippines.
* [[Batik]] shirt — worn by men and women in Indonesia.
* [[Kebaya]] — worn by women in Malaysia and Indonesia.
* [[Cheongsam]] — a modern female variation of the Qing Dynasty silk dress, characterized by a high mandarin collar, and side open slits of varying lengths. It can be sleeveless, short, elbow or long sleeve, and has been adopted by most Chinese women as a Chinese wear, depending on materials and occasions.
* [[Changshan]] — a long male version of the [[qipao]], which originated during the Qing Dynasty. It can be of cotton for ordinary wear, or of silk for those within aristocratic families. Beneath the changshan, the male generally wears white mandarin-collar long-sleeve shirt and a pair of dark colored long pants. Like the qipao, this changshan male gown has slits on both sides (at least knee level) as well. Worn nowadays either by Chinese men in the martial arts world, or as attire for weddings to match the qipao the bride wears. The qipao and changshan originated as Manchu dresses which government officials, but not ordinary civilians, were required to wear under the [[Qing]] Dynasty's laws. Gradually, the general non-official Han Chinese civilian population voluntarily shifted from wearing traditional Chinese [[hanfu]] clothing to the qipao and changshan.
* [[Bisht (clothing)|Bisht]] — worn by men with [[thawb]] and [[Keffiyeh|shmagh or ghutrah]] and [[Agal (accessory)|agal]] in formal and religious occasions, e.g. [[Eid al-Fitr|Eid]], in some Eastern [[Arab]] countries like ([[Saudi Arabia]], [[Iraq]], [[Kuwait]], [[UAE]], [[Qatar]], [[Bahrain]] and others).
* [[Av Pak]] — both traditional and modern embroidered blouse worn by women in [[Cambodia]] at Special occasion, traditional festival and Formal show.

{{Costume}}

A '''folk costume''' (also '''regional costume''', '''national costume''', or '''traditional garment''') expresses an [[national identity|identity]] through [[costume]], which is usually associated with a geographic area or a period of time in history. It can also indicate social, marital and/or religious status. Such costumes often come in two forms: one for everyday occasions, the other for [[festival]]s and [[formal wear]].

Following the outbreak of [[romantic nationalism]], the peasantry of [[Europe]] came to serve as models for all that appeared genuine and desirable. Their dress crystallised into so-called &quot;typical&quot; forms, and enthusiasts adopted that attire as part of their [[symbol]]ism.

In areas where contemporary Western fashions have become usual, traditional garments are often worn at special events or celebrations; particularly those connected with cultural traditions, heritage or pride.

In modern times, there are instances where traditional garments are required by [[sumptuary law]]s. In [[Bhutan]], the traditional [[Tibet]]an-style clothing of ''[[gho]]'' and ''kera'' for men, ''[[kira (dress)|kira]]'' and ''toego'' for women, must be worn by all citizens, including those not of Tibetan heritage. In [[Saudi Arabia]], women are also required to wear the [[abaya]] in public.

[[Image:Jacket2-1.jpg|thumb|right|A [[sports jacket]], known as a &quot;sport coat&quot; in the U.S.]]
A '''jacket''' is a mid-stomach–length garment for the upper body. A jacket typically has [[sleeve]]s, and fastens in the front or slightly on the side. A jacket is generally lighter, tighter-fitting, and less insulating than a [[coat (clothing)|coat]], which is [[outerwear]]. Some jackets are [[fashion]]able, while others serve as [[protective clothing]].

==Etymology==
The word ''jacket'' comes from the French word ''jaquette''. The term comes from the [[Middle French]] noun ''jaquet'', which refers to a small or lightweight [[tunic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{OEtymD|jacket|accessdate=2011-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Modern French]], ''jaquette'' is synonymous with ''jacket''. Speakers of [[American English]] sometimes informally use the words ''jacket'' and ''coat'' interchangeably.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'', [[Oxford University Press]], 1971&lt;/ref&gt;

{{About|bachelor parties}}
{{Redirect|Stag night|film|Stag Night}}
{{Refimprove|date=June 2009}}
[[Image:Wes' Bachelor Party 005.jpg|right|thumb|A bachelor being led to his party]]
A '''bachelor party''' also known as a '''stag party''', '''stag night''', '''stag do''', '''stag weekend''' (in Canada, United Kingdom, Ireland, and New Zealand), or a '''buck's night''' (in Australia)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://theknot.ninemsn.com.au/wedding-planning/pre-wedding-events/bucks-party/10-great-bucks-night-ideas| title=10 Great Bucks Night Ideas|date=2014|accessdate=25 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[party]] held for a man shortly before he enters [[marriage]], to celebrate his &quot;last night of freedom&quot;. A bachelor party is usually planned by the groom, occasionally with the assistance of a [[Party service|bachelor party planning company]]. As it is a celebration of a man's last night of freedom, it is quite common but not always the case that friends of the groom will organize female company such as strippers or topless waitresses as a last goodbye to that part of the groom's life. It is also common that it is a last-ditch attempt to lead the groom into temptation before the wedding and to make sure he is fully committed to his marriage proposal.{{cn|date=August 2015}}

==Variations==
The equivalent event for the bride-to-be is known as a [[bachelorette party]] or hens' night.{{cn|date=August 2015}} 

Some also choose instead to hold a so-called [[Stag and doe|Stag and Doe]] party in the US, or a ''hag party'' or ''hag do'' in the UK (&quot;hag&quot; being a combination of the words &quot;hen&quot; and &quot;stag&quot;), in which both the bride and groom attend.

===Germany===
In Germany, this event is called ''Junggesellenabschied'', which literally means &quot;farewell to bachelorhood.&quot; There is also a separate event that the couple celebrates together on the evening prior to their wedding, called ''[[Polterabend]]''. At the Polterabend the guests break old porcelain and earthenware to bring luck to the couple's marriage. The tradition is said to go back to pre-Christian times; by noisily breaking ceramics evil spirits – especially spirits of envy – are supposed to be driven out. In the last couple of years, Anglo-style bachelor parties have become more and more popular among bachelors. In parts of northern Germany that lack a [[Carnival]] tradition, funny costuming has become a popular part of bachelor or bachelorette parties.

Some parts of Germany have a related custom, in which a person who is not yet married by their 30th birthday, is made to dress up in an embarrassing fashion by their friends and to do silly tasks that most often include some kind of cleaning work.

===France===
In France and in many French-speaking regions such as [[Quebec]], the bachelor party is called ''{{lang|fr|enterrement de vie de garçon}}'', which literally means &quot;(the) burial of the life as a boy&quot; or &quot;burial/funeral of the life as a bachelor&quot;. For women it is ''{{lang|fr|enterrement de vie de jeune fille}}'', translated as &quot;burial/funeral of the life as a young girl/maiden&quot;. As in English-speaking countries, such parties often feature heavy drinking and various (although gentle) humiliations, and sometimes the presence of a stripper.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}

===Israel===
In Israel, the bachelor party is called ''{{lang|he|מסיבת רווקים}}''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=חשפניות|url=http://israel-stripers.co.il/|publisher=www.israel-stripers.co.il|accessdate=18 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such parties often feature heavy drinking and sometimes the presence of strippers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A Very Israeli Bachelor Party|url=http://blogs.timesofisrael.com/a-very-israeli-bachelor-party/|publisher=Times of Israel|accessdate=18 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Kingdom and Ireland===
In the United Kingdom, it is now common for the party to last for more than one evening, hence the increasing prevalence of the phrase &quot;stag weekend&quot;, or &quot;stag do&quot;. A spin-off has been the growth of the stag weekend industry in the UK with various companies taking over the preparation of the event.{{cn|date=February 2016}}

In the UK, stag weekend trips are becoming mini-holidays with the groups taking part in various day-time activities as well as the expected night out on the town.

Booking a stag do in the UK can be difficult, as many establishments are wary about allowing entrance. Whether it's a place to stay or entry to a club, many businesses have been known to highlight their refusal to these groups. This is partly instigated by constant [http://www.yorkpress.co.uk/news/13371479.Teaching_assistant_glassed_bus_driver__in_stag_night_brawl_in_York_nightclub/ media attention surrounding how drunk members get] on their bachelor party. For this reason, it is often recommended that you book at least 3 months in advance.

===United States and Canada===
In the United States, [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]] is both a popular bachelor party destination and location for the wedding itself.&lt;ref name=&quot;boyer&quot;/&gt; Increasingly, &quot;destination bachelor parties&quot; are replacing standard nights out, with Americans traveling to [[Montreal, Quebec]] or [[Mexico]].&lt;ref&gt;Austin, Michael. &quot;Bachelor parties skip town&quot;. ''Crain's Chicago Business''. 7 May 2007. p.&amp;nbsp;53–58. ''MasterFILE Premier'' EBSCOHost. Retrieved 23 May 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bachelor parties in the US stereotypically entail the mass consumption of alcohol, hiring a [[stripper]], and general rowdiness toward which the bride might not have a positive reaction; in fact, the defining feature of the bachelor party is that the fiancée is not present. Increasingly, bachelor parties have come to symbolize the last time when the groom is free of the influence of his new wife.{{fact|date=May 2014}}

Canadian bachelor parties generally consist of a group of bachelors celebrating their singleness. 

Canadian cities such as [[Vancouver]] or [[Niagara Falls]] are popular stag party destinations due to their large number of [[strip club]]s with &quot;dance contact&quot; ([[lap dance|lap dancing]]). Montreal in particular is popular for this purpose with both Canadians and Americans alike.{{fact|date=May 2014}}

As an alternative, the best man may plan an activity in secret with friends that they feel the groom will enjoy. Many grooms-to-be have been treated to camping trips with friends, fishing trips, sporting events, video games, poker, barbecuing, and other activities.{{fact|date=May 2014}}

===Australia and New Zealand===
Referred to most commonly as a &quot;buck's&quot; night celebration in Australia. It follows similar traditions to The United States and Canada such as high volumes of alcohol consumed by the buck and the hiring of strippers and topless waitresses. Females are not usually invited to attend unless they are erotic dancers or topless waitresses. A practice that is growing in popularity is for friends of the groom to [[Honey trapping|honey trap]] or tempt the groom into cheating on his soon to be wife with strippers and topless bar girls.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Sarungan.jpg|thumb|right|[[Java]]nese men often wear sarongs during religious or casual occasions. [[Surabaya]], [[East Java]], [[Indonesia]].]]

A '''sarong''' or '''sarung''' ({{IPAc-en|s|ə|ˈ|r|ɒ|ŋ}}; [[Malay language|Malay]] and [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]]: {{IPA-may|ˈsaroŋ|}}, [[Malaysian language|Malaysian]]: {{IPA-may|ˈsarʊŋ|}}, [[Arabic]]: صارون; meaning &quot;''[[Scabbard|sheath]]''&quot; in [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]] and [[Malay language|Malay]]) is a large tube or length of [[textile|fabric]], often wrapped around the waist and worn by men and women throughout much of [[South Asia]],&lt;ref name=&quot;alternate-name-in-south-asia&quot;&gt;[[Lungi]]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Southeast Asia]], the [[Arabian Peninsula]], the [[Horn of Africa]], and on many [[Pacific island]]s. The fabric most often has woven [[plaid (pattern)|plaid]] or checkered patterns, or may be brightly colored by means of [[batik]] or [[ikat]] [[dyeing]]. Many modern sarongs have [[printed]] designs, often depicting [[animal]]s or [[plant]]s.

== Overview ==
[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Sarongweefster uit Bandoeng Java TMnr 10014439.jpg|thumb|left|[[Sundanese people|Sundanese]] sarong [[weaver (occupation)|weaver]] in [[Bandung]], [[West Java]], [[Dutch East Indies]], 1900–1940.]]

[[File:Chau Doc textile.jpg|thumb|Sarung denotes a length of fabric as a [[garment]].]]
''Sarong'' or &quot;sarung&quot;  denotes the lower garment worn by the Indonesian (and other [[Maritime Southeast Asia]]n) men. This consists of length of fabric about a yard (0.91 m) wide and two-and-a-half yards (2.3 m) long. In the center of this sheet, across the narrower width, a panel of contrasting color or pattern about one foot wide is woven or dyed into the fabric, which is known as the ''kepala'' or &quot;head&quot; of the sarong. This sheet is stitched at the narrower edges to form a tube. One steps into this tube, brings the upper edge above the level of the navel (the hem should be level with the ankles), positions the ''kepala'' at the center of the back, and folds in the excess fabric from both sides to the front center, where they overlap and secures the sarong by rolling the upper hem down over itself. Malay men wear sarongs woven in a check pattern; women wear sarongs dyed in the [[batik]] method, with, for example, flower motifs, and in brighter colors.  However, in [[Javanese people|Javanese culture]], the wearing of batik sarung is not restricted to women on formal occasions such as weddings.

The sarong is common wear for women, in formal settings with a ''[[kebaya]]'' blouse. Malay men wear sarongs in public only when attending Friday prayers at the [[mosque]], but sarongs remain very common casual wear at home for men and women of all ethnicities and religions in [[Brunei]], [[Indonesia]], [[Malaysia]], [[Singapore]], [[Sarong#Sri Lanka|Sri Lanka]], and much of the Indian subcontinent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.e-pao.net/epSubPageExtractor.asp?src=manipur.Sports_and_Manipur.Indigenous_Games_between_Cambodia_and_Manipur |title=Singh, Atom Sunil; &quot;Indigenous Games between Cambodia and Manipur: A Borderless Connectivity&quot; |work=E-pao.net |date= |accessdate=2011-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; (In South Asia, sarongs are typically known as ''[[mundu]]'' or ''[[lungi]]'').

==Regional variations==

=== Arabian Peninsula ===
{{Main|Izaar}} [[Image:Bayt al-Faqih market.jpg|thumb|left|[[Yemen]]i men in traditional sarongs.]]
[[Image:Bait al-Faqih.jpg|thumb|right|[[Yemen]]i man tying his ''futah'' (sarong). Sometimes people keep money and other small utensils in the folds of the futah.]]

Sarongs known under a variety of local names are traditionally worn by the people of [[Yemen]] and elsewhere on the [[Arabian Peninsula]]. Local names for the garment include ''fūṭah'', ''[[izaar]]'', ''wizār'' and ''maʿwaz'' (pl. ''maʿāwiz''). In [[Hadhramawt]] sarong is called ''ṣārūn'' in the interior and ''ṣārūm'' in the coastal region. In [[Oman]], sarongs are called ''wizār'' and are often white in color, similar to the [[Kerala]]n ''[[mundu]]'' of [[South Asia]] and it is usually worn under the [[Thawb]]. In [[Saudi Arabia]], sarongs are known as [[izaar]]. Designs can be checkered or striped as well floral or [[Arabesque (Islamic art)|arabesque]], but double plaid (i.e., a vertical section of the ''izār'' with a different plaid pattern) designs from [[Indonesia]] are also very popular. In southwestern Saudi Arabia, tribal groups have their own style of unstitched izaar, which is locally woven. This is also worn in northern Yemen. However, the tribal groups in Yemen each have their own design for their ''fūṭah'', the latter of which may include tassels and fringes. It is thought that these tribal futah resemble the original izaar as worn on the [[Arabian Peninsula]] since pre-Islamic times such as the [[Shendyt]]. They are generally worn open and unstitched in such a way that the garment does not reach over one's ankles. Other izaars, often imported from Bangladesh, are the traditional clothing of [[Arab]] fishermen of the [[Persian Gulf]], the [[Indian Ocean]] and the [[Red Sea]]. It was the traditional garment for men before the introduction of pant-like pyjamas and [[kaftan]]s during the Turkish and European colonial periods. Tube-stitched as well as open sarongs are both worn, even in formal [[Thawb|dishdasha]]-wearing countries, as casual sleep wear and at home.

===South Asia===
[[Image:LungiBoypagne.jpg|thumb|right|[[Bangladesh]]i boy in a traditional [[lungi]].]]
{{Main|Lungi}}
Sarongs are widespread in the Northeast part of India – in the state of [[Manipur]], where they are called ''[[phanek]]'', in the South [[India]]n states of [[Kerala]], where they are called ''[[mundu]]'' (if fully white or fully black) and ''[[lungi]]'' or ''[[lungi|kaili]]'' if coloured, and [[Tamil Nadu]], where they are called ''[[sarem (clothing)|sarem]]'' or ''[[veshti]]'' or ''[[lungi]]'' and are usually worn at home. A standard lungi measures 2.12 by 1.2 metres.

Unlike the brightly coloured Southeast Asian sarongs, the Kerala variety (the mundu) is more often plain white and is worn for ceremonial or religious purposes. In Kerala, the brightly coloured sarongs are called ''kaily'' and the white ones are called mundu. The more formal, all-white [[dhoti]] is worn for formal and religious occasions. While there are dresses based on the mundu which can be worn by women, they more commonly wear the [[sari]].

=== Somalia ===
[[File:Old man in Harar.jpg|thumb|right|[[Somali people|Somali]] man wearing a ''macawiis'' sarong.]]
Sarongs are ubiquitous in [[Somalia]] and the [[Muslim]]-inhabited areas of the [[Horn of Africa]]. Although [[nomad]]ic and urban [[Somali people|Somali]] men have worn them for centuries in the form of a plain white [[skirt]], the colorful ''macawiis'' (ma'awiis) sarong, which is the most popular form of the garment in the region, is a relatively recent arrival to Somalia courtesy of trade with the [[Southeast Asia|Southeast Asian islands]] and the [[Indian subcontinent]]. Before the 1940s, most macawiis were made of [[cotton]]. However, since the industrialization of the market for sarongs, they now come in many fabrics and combinations thereof, including [[polyester]], [[nylon]] and [[silk]].

Designs vary greatly and range from checkered square motifs with watermarked diamonds and [[plaid (pattern)|plaid]] to simple geometric lines. The one constant is that they tend to be quite colorful; black macawiis are rare. Sarongs in Somalia are worn around the waist and folded several times over to secure their position. They are typically sold pre-sewn as one long circular stretch of cloth, though some vendors offer to sew them as a [[value-added]] service.

=== Sri Lanka ===
[[File:Bhangra Dance punjab.jpg|thumb|Group of [[Bhangra (dance)|Bhangra]] dancers wearing a traditional [[Punjabi Tamba and Kurta|Kurta and Chaadra]].]]
Sarongs are very common in [[Sri Lanka]] and worn only by men. (A similar garment is worn by women. However, the women's garment is called &quot;redda&quot;, which is wraparound skirt.) It is the standard garment for most men in rural and even some urban communities. However, most men of upper social classes (whose public attire is trousers) wear the sarong only as a convenient night garment or only within the confines of the house.

Statistically, the number of people wearing sarong as their primary public attire is on the decline in [[Sri Lanka]]; the reason being that the sarong carries the stigma of being the attire for less educated lower social classes. However, there is a trend toward adopting sarong as a fashionable garment or as a formal garment worn with national pride, only on special occasions.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.travelsrilanka.com/index.cfm?PAGE=1176  {{wayback|url=http://www.travelsrilanka.com/index.cfm?PAGE=1176 |date=20071007044002 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Political and social leaders of Sri Lanka who want to portray their humility and closeness to &quot;common man&quot; and their nationalism, choose a variation of the sarong nicknamed the &quot;national&quot; as their public attire.

===Western world===
In North America and Europe, hip wraps are worn as beach wear or as a cover-up over [[swimwear]]. The wrap is often made of a thin, light fabric, often [[rayon]], and may feature decorative fringing on both sides. They may have ties, which are long thin straps of fabric which the wearer can tie together to prevent the wrap from falling down. These wraps are almost exclusively worn by women and do not usually resemble traditional Asian or African sarongs in size, pattern or design.

==Securing==
Numerous tying methods exist to hold a sarong to the wearer's body.  In some cases, these techniques customarily differ according to the gender of wearer.  If a sarong has ties, they may be used to hold it in place.  If no ties exist, a pin may be used, the fabric may be tightly tucked under itself in layers, the corners of the main sheet may be around the body and knotted, or a [[belt (clothing)|belt]] may be used to hold the sarong in place.

==Motion pictures==
The American public is most familiar with the sarong for the dozens of [[motion pictures]] set in the South Seas, most of them romantic dramas made in the 1930s and 1940s.  [[Dorothy Lamour]] is by far the actress most linked with the garment, which was designed by [[Edith Head]].  Lamour starred in multiple films of this genre, starting with ''[[The Hurricane (1937 film)|The Hurricane]]'' in 1937.  In fact, Lamour was nicknamed &quot;The Sarong Girl&quot; by the press and even wore a sarong on occasion in more traditional films.  Among the other actresses to don the sarong for film roles are [[Maria Montez]], [[Gilda Gray]], [[Myrna Loy]], [[Gene Tierney]], [[Frances Farmer]] and [[Movita]].  Male stars who wore the manly sarongs on film include [[Jon Hall (actor)|Jon Hall]], [[Ray Milland]], [[Tyrone Power]], [[Robert Preston (actor)|Robert Preston]], [[Sabu Dastagir]] and [[Ralph Fiennes]] in ''[[The Constant Gardener (film)|The Constant Gardener]]''. The sarong was also worn by Pierce Brosnan in ''[[The Thomas Crown Affair (1999 film)|The Thomas Crown Affair]]'' (1999). In documentary movie, we can see [[soldiers]] in Sarong directed by Lokendra Arambam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cultureunplugged.com/play/1156/Soldiers-in-Sarong |title=Soldiers in Sarong directed by Lokendra Arambam |work=Cultureunplugged.com |date= |accessdate=2011-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Homecoming''' is the tradition of welcoming back [[Alumnus|alumni]] of a school. It is a tradition in many [[universities]], [[college]]s, and [[high school]]s in the [[United States]]. It usually includes activities for students and alumni, such as sports and culture events and a parade through the streets of the city or town. Homecoming should not be confused with [[prom]], as they occur at different times of the year. Homecoming usually occurs in the fall, and prom usually occurs in the spring.

{{TOC limit}}

==United States==
Homecoming is an annual tradition in the United States. People, towns, high schools, and colleges come together, usually in late September or early October, to welcome back alumni and former residents. It is built around a central event, such as a [[banquet]] and, most often, a game of [[American football|football]], or, on occasion, [[basketball]], [[ice hockey]] or [[soccer]]. When celebrated by schools, the activities vary widely. However, they usually consist of a football game played on a school's home football field, activities for students and alumni, a [[parade]] featuring the school's [[marching band]] and sports teams, and the coronation of a Homecoming Queen (and at many schools, a Homecoming King). A dance commonly follows the game or the day following the game. When attached to a football game, Homecoming traditionally occurs on the team's return from the longest road trip of the season. The game itself, whether it be football or another sport, will typically feature the home team playing a considerably weaker opponent. The game is supposed to be an &quot;easy win&quot; and thus weaker schools will sometimes play lower division schools.

===Origins===
[[File:Homecoming1911.jpg|thumb|right|The [[1911 Kansas vs. Missouri football game]] is one of several claimed to be the first college football homecoming game.]]
The tradition of Homecoming has its origin in alumni football games held at colleges and universities since the 19th century. Many schools including Baylor, Southwestern, Illinois, and Missouri&lt;ref&gt;http://www.columbiamissourian.com/stories/2006/10/20/traditions-beginnings-mysterious/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yorknewstimes.com/articles/2011/09/23/editorials/doc4e7c08259fabd268415990.txt|title=Vincent's Views|work=York News-Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tcpalm.com/news/2011/sep/23/its-high-school-homecoming-season-on-the-coast/|title=It's high school homecoming season on the Treasure Coast|author=Zaimarie De Guzman|work=TCP}}&lt;/ref&gt; have made claims that they've held the first modern homecoming. The [[NCAA]], ''[[Trivial Pursuit]]'', ''[[Jeopardy!]]'', and references from the American TV drama ''[[NCIS (TV series)|NCIS]]'' give the title to the [[University of Missouri]]'s 1911 [[American football|football]] game during which alumni were encouraged to attend. It was the first annual homecoming centered on a parade and a football game.&lt;ref name=&quot;battle&quot;&gt;{{cite web | last = Cramton | first = Michael | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = The History of Homecoming| publisher = Active.com| date = | url = http://www.active.com/football/Articles/The_History_of_Homecoming | format = | doi = | accessdate = 2013-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1891, the [[Missouri Tigers football|Missouri Tigers]] first faced off against the [[Kansas Jayhawks football|Kansas Jayhawks]] in the first installment of the [[Border War (Kansas–Missouri rivalry)|Border War]], which is also the oldest college football rivalry west of the [[Mississippi River]]. The intense rivalry originally took place at neutral sites, usually in [[Kansas City, Missouri]], until a new conference regulation was announced that required intercollegiate football games to be played on collegiate campuses.  To renew excitement in the rivalry, ensure adequate attendance at the new location, and celebrate the first meeting of the two teams on the Mizzou campus in [[Columbia, Missouri]], Mizzou Athletic Director [[Chester Brewer]] invited all alumni to &quot;come home&quot; for the game in 1911.  Along with the football game, the celebration included a parade and spirit rally with bonfire. The event was a success, with nearly 10,000 alumni coming home to take part in the celebration and watch the Tigers and Jayhawks play to a 3–3 tie. The Missouri annual homecoming, with its parade and spirit rally centered on a large football game is the model that has gone on to take hold at colleges and high schools across the United States.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dailyemerald.com/home/index.cfm?event=displayArticlePrinterFriendly&amp;uStory_id=3b6196ac-c8ed-4620-a9c9-439789ddd7cc&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mizzou.com/homecoming/history.html&lt;/ref&gt;

At least two collegiate homecoming celebrations predate the University of Missouri football game homecoming event: [[Southwestern University]], in Georgetown, TX and [[Baylor University]], in Waco, TX. By multiple historical accounts, Southwestern held the first Homecoming on record on Wednesday, April 21, 1909 in San Gabriel Park. Former students raised funds, provided homes, prepared and served a barbecue supper, and decorated the town buildings. Members of the senior class waited tables.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jones|first1=William B.|title=To Survive and Excel: The Story of Southwestern University 1840-2000|date=2006|isbn=0967091241|pages=151|url=http://southwestern.edu/infoservices/documents/ToSurviveAndExcel.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Northern Illinois University]] has one of the longest-celebrated homecoming traditions in the country. The alumni football game played on Oct. 10, 1903, began NIU’s homecoming tradition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://myniu.com/blog/homecoming-list/homecoming-festivities/|title=Alumni Village - NIU Alumni Association|work=NIU Alumni Association}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Baylor's homecoming history dates back to November 1909 and included a parade, reunion parties and an afternoon football game (the final game of the 1909 season), a tradition that continued and celebrated its 100th anniversary in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bayloralumniassociation.com/content/programs_and_awards/traditions.asp|title=Baylor Alumni Association|work=bayloralumniassociation.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bayloralumniassociation.com/content/programs_and_awards/parade.asp|title=Baylor Alumni Association|work=bayloralumniassociation.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was a gap between 1910 and 1915 when there was no homecoming event, however there has been continuity since 1915. The University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign claims to have first held a homecoming event in 1910, celebrating the 100th anniversary in 2010.  This event was held annually except for the 1918 season.

===Traditions===

====Homecoming Court====
[[File:14497-Homecoming Football vs McMurray-3918 (15726901335).jpg|thumb|The 2014 homecoming court at Texas A&amp;M University–Commerce]]

The Homecoming Court is a representative group of students that, in a coeducational institution, consists of a King and Queen, and possibly Prince(s) and Princess(es). In a single-sex institution, the Homecoming Court will usually consist of only a King and a Prince (for a male school) or a Queen and a Princess (for a female school), although some schools may choose to join with single-sex schools of the opposite sex to elect the Homecoming Court jointly.

Generally, the King and Queen are students completing their final years of study at their school (also called seniors), while the Prince and Princess are underclassmen, often with a Prince/Princess for each grade. Recently, some high schools have chosen to add categories, such as Duke and Duchess, to extend the representation of students to include a category in which students with special needs are elected. In high school, 17- or 18-year-old students in their final year are represented by a King or Queen; in college, students who are completing their final year of study, usually between 21 and 23 years old.

Classmates traditionally nominate students who have done a lot to contribute to their school, then students vote for members of the Court from the nominees. Once the Homecoming Court candidates are announced, the entire student body votes for the Queen and King. The voting is often conducted by [[secret ballot]], but other methods may also be used by certain schools.

Local rules determine when the Homecoming Queen and King are crowned. Sometimes, the big announcement comes at a [[pep rally]], school assembly, or public ceremony one or more days before the football game. Other schools crown their royalty at the Homecoming football game, a dance or other school event.

Often, the previous year's Queen and King are invited back to crown their successors. If they are absent for whatever reason, someone else—usually, another previous Queen or King, a popular teacher, or other designated person—will perform those duties. Usually, the Queen is crowned first, followed by the King. The crowning method also varies by school.

Homecoming court members who are not crowned king or queen are often called escorts or royalty. They are often expected to participate in the week's activities as well. At some schools, a Homecoming Prince/Princess, Duke/Duchess, etc. (often underclassmen nominated by their classmates) are crowned along with the King and Queen; sometimes, middle school and junior high students may partake in the high school activities.

====Parade====
[[File:13399-Homecoming Tailgate and Game-1839 (10714677125).jpg|thumb|left|Homecoming parade at Texas A&amp;M University–Commerce in 2013]]

Many Homecoming celebrations include a parade. Students often select the grand marshal based on his/her service and support to the school and/or community. The parade includes the school's marching band and different school organizations floats created by the classes and organizations and most of the sports get a chance to be in the parade. Every class prepares a float which corresponds with the Homecoming theme or related theme of school spirit as assign by school administrators. In addition, the Homecoming Court takes part in the parade, often riding together in one or more convertibles as part of the parade. The parade is often part of a series of activities scheduled for that specific day, which can also include a pep rally, [[bonfire]], [[snake dance]], and other activities for students and alumni. That can include many more things that can stay still with the 'Homecoming' start with the cases.

====Tailgate====
[[File:14497-Homecoming Football vs McMurray-9338 (15106869054).jpg|thumb|Homecoming tailgate at Texas A&amp;M University–Commerce in 2014]]

At most major colleges and universities, the football game and preceding [[tailgate party]] are the most widely recognized and heavily attended events of the week. Alumni gather from all around the world to return to their Alma Mater and reconnect with one another and take part in the festivities. Students, alumni, businesses, and members of the community set up tents in parking lots, fields, and streets near the stadium to cook out, play games, socialize, binge drink, and even enjoy live music in many instances. These celebrations often last straight through the game for those who do not have tickets but still come to take part in the socializing and excitement of the homecoming atmosphere. Most tents even include television or radio feeds of the game for those without tickets.

====Picnic====
Sometimes during the school week, a picnic can occur. The picnic is very similar to the tailgate party, but it occurs after school or during the school's lunch period.

====Dress-up days====
Throughout the week, many schools (particularly high schools) engage in special dress-up days, sometimes called &quot;Spirit Week&quot;, where students are allowed to wear clothing suitable to the theme (e.g., 80s day, [[toga]] day, roll out of bed day, [[cowboy]] day, [[nerd]] day, [[pirate]] day, [[Rat Pack]] Day, flannel Friday, What-not-to-wear Wednesday) leading to the homecoming. Students traditionally wear clothing with their school's name, or clothing and makeup of their school's colors on Friday.

====Pep Rallies====
Many schools hold a rally during homecoming week, often one or more nights before the game. The events vary, but may include skits, games, introduction of the homecoming court (and coronation of the King and Queen if that is the school's tradition), and comments from the football players and/or coach about the upcoming game.

At some schools, the Homecoming rally ends with a bonfire (in which old wood structures, the rival school's memorabilia and other items are burned in a controlled fire.) Many colleges and high schools no longer hold bonfires because of accidents that have occurred surrounding these events in the past. The most well known accident took place in 1999, when [[Aggie Bonfire#199 collapse|12 students]] were killed and 27 others were injured at [[Texas A&amp;M University]] when a {{convert|40|ft|m|adj=mid|-tall}} pile of logs that had been assembled for a bonfire collapsed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thedartmouth.com/2006/10/13/news/safety/ |title=Safety concerns hope to protect bonfire for future generations |publisher=TheDartmouth.com |date=2006-10-13 |accessdate=2012-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this incident was not associated with homecoming—A&amp;M is one of the few schools that does not organize a homecoming, although it has [[Traditions of Texas A&amp;M University|many unique traditions]]. The bonfire was associated with the annual [[State Farm Lone Star Showdown|rivalry game]] between [[Texas A&amp;M Aggies football|A&amp;M]] and the [[Texas Longhorns football|University of Texas]].

====Alumni Band====
The Alumni Band consists of former college and university band members who return for homecoming to perform with the current marching band (usually made up from recent graduates to members who graduated years or decades before ) either during halftime as a full band or a featured section i.e.the Trumpet Section or the Tubas and Drumline squads as well as performing with the current band during the post game concert.

====Mums and Garters====
High schools in the south of the United States, especially in Texas, often have a tradition of the girls wearing &quot;mums&quot; and boys wearing &quot;garters&quot; to the Homecoming football game. Mums usually consist of artificial Chrysanthemum flowers (originally real Chrysanthemums were used) surrounded by decorated floor-length ribbon and little trinkets. The tradition is that the boys create a personalized mum in their school colors, white and silver for seniors, for their date. Girls make garters for their date which are similar to mums but shorter and worn on the guy's arm rather than around their neck like mums. The size of the mums and garters tend to grow along with the grade the person that is receiving the mum is in. Around the 1980s, mums were usually about a maximum of three Chrysanthemum flowers and a few ribbons and only worn by the Homecoming Court/Homecoming Prince and/or Princess but as the years have gone by, the size and expectations of mums have increased and have gotten more elaborate and are worn by almost all of the students. Depending on the school, mums can get quite competitive, expensive, and drastically bigger than they previously were intended to be. New items are also placed on mums than there previously were like LED lights, bubble containers, cow bells, feather boas, stuffed animals of all sizes, and even more. They now sometimes act like scrapbooks made of ribbon and even contain passages and photos of the mum/garter-receiver and their date. The detail, size, and price usually varies depending on the school, town, and couple. The tradition is to make the mum and garter after the couple is asked to Homecoming and exchange the night of the Homecoming game and wear it throughout tailgating and the game. Couples often take group pictures with their mums and garters the night of or before the night of the Homecoming Game to showcase them.

====Homecoming dance====
{{unreferenced section|date=October 2012}}
The Homecoming Dance—usually the culminating event of the week (for high schools)—is a formal or informal event, either at the school or an off-campus location. The venue is decorated, and either a disc jockey or band is hired to play music. In many ways, it is a fall [[prom]]. Homecoming dances could be informal as well just like standard school dances. At high schools, the homecoming dances are sometimes held in the high school gymnasium or outside in a large field. Home coming dance attire is more semi-formal than prom. Women generally wear knee length dresses with their hair down, and men generally wear a tucked in dress shirt with pants. At prom, women generally wear a more formal gown that goes to the ground with hair up, and men wear  suits and tuxedos.

Since most colleges are too large to facilitate a campus-wide dance, these events are usually handled instead by student organizations such as fraternities, sororities, and residential colleges. Because football and alumni events are the focal points of collegiate homecoming, dances often take place during a different week when schedules are more permitting, or not at all.

===Competitions===
At the high school level, students generally compete by grade level in events such as the spirit days, parade floats, and [[powder puff football]]. The competition at the collegiate level is mainly between Greek-letter organizations and, to a lesser degree, residence halls. At most larger schools, fraternities and sororities compete on parade floats, house decorations, skits, talent competitions, and even service events such as blood drives or food drives. Sometimes on coronation night, some schools have games that they play between classes. Such events include the pyramid, the 3 legged race, the pop chug, and tug of war.

===Smaller school homecomings===
While most schools schedule their Homecoming activities around football, smaller schools that do not field a football team may plan the annual event at another time of the year. In these instances, basketball, ice hockey or soccer serves as the &quot;big game&quot; for students and alumni. Often in smaller towns with smaller populations, the parade is omitted.

At schools without athletic programs, the centerpiece event is usually a banquet, where alumni are recognized. This format is also used for alumni events of high schools that have either closed or consolidated with other high schools; the high school classes continue to meet and celebrate their years at their now-defunct [[alma mater]]. In other cases, alumni of closed schools will participate with the consolidated school's homecoming, where special recognition is often given for alumni of the once-separate schools.

===Courtwarming===
In some parts of the country, high school basketball has gained a homecoming celebration of its own. Often referred to as ''Winter Homecoming'', ''Hoopcoming'', ''Coronation'', ''Snowcoming'', &quot;Colors Day,&quot; or ''Courtwarming'' (the latter is especially prominent in parts of Missouri), it usually includes rallies, dress-up days, special dinners, king and queen coronations, and other winter-friendly activities typically associated with football homecoming.

==Canada==
The best-known and largest homecoming weekends are held by [[Queen's University]], the [[University of Manitoba]], [[McGill University]], [[McMaster University]], [[Trent University]], the [[University of Guelph]], [[Wilfrid Laurier University]], and the [[University of Western Ontario]] each year. Canadian homecoming weekends are often centred on a football game but are also filled with events such as &quot;pancake keggers&quot; and parades.

In [[Newfoundland and Labrador]], communities have a &quot;[[Come Home Year]]&quot; where people who have moved away from their town come back from across Canada. In 2000, there was a provincial &quot;Come Home Year&quot;, where many people came back to visit their various communities.

Homecomings are popular among high schools in eastern Canada. [[Newmarket High School]], [[London South Collegiate Institute]], [[Banting Memorial High School]] and [[Earl Haig Secondary School]] are examples of known schools in Ontario to arrange homecomings. Upper Canada College also has a longstanding homecoming tradition, although the event is referred to as &quot;A-Day&quot; (Association Day).

== Church homecomings ==
The term &quot;homecoming&quot; can also refer to the special services conducted by some religious congregations, particularly by many smaller American Protestant churches, to celebrate church heritage and welcome back former members or pastors. They are often held annually, but are sometimes held as one-time-only events, to celebrate the occasion.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Bell-bottoms''' (or '''flares''') are a style of [[trousers]] that become wider from the [[knee]]s downward, forming a bell-like shape of the trouser leg. Also known today as &quot;bootcut&quot; or &quot;bootfit&quot;.

==History==

===Naval origins===
[[Image:Sailors1854.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Illustration of sailors in uniform, 1854]]
In the early 19th century, when a standardized uniform did not yet exist in the [[U.S Navy]], some sailors adopted a style of wide trousers ending in bell-shaped cuffs.&lt;ref name=&quot;ohl&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author=Ohl, Bob|url=http://history.navy.mil/library/online/uniform_bell.htm|title=Have Bell Bottoms...Will Travel|journal=All Hands|volume=460|date=June 1955|pages=28–30.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;dervis&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author=Dervis|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20060409134729/http://www.madetomeasuremag.com/features/pre2003/953843329.html|archivedate=2006-04-09|url=http://www.madetomeasuremag.com/features/pre2003/953843329.html|title=Bell Bottom Blues|work=Made to Measure Magazine|date=March 23, 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;mil&quot;/&gt; In 1813, one of the first recorded descriptions of [[sailor]]s' uniforms, written by [[Commodore (USN)|Commodore]] [[Stephen Decatur]], noted that the men on the frigates ''United States'' and ''Macedonia'' were wearing &quot;glazed [[canvas]] [[hat]]s with stiff brims, decked with streamers of [[ribbon]], blue jackets buttoned loosely over [[waistcoat]]s, and blue trousers with bell bottoms.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;ohl&quot;/&gt;

The British [[Royal Navy]] had often been a leader in nautical fashion, but bell-bottoms did not become part of the standard uniform until the mid-19th century.&lt;ref name=&quot;dervis&quot;/&gt; These &quot;bell-bottoms&quot; were often just very wide-legged trousers, rather than shaped trousers that flared below the knee.&lt;ref name=&quot;dervis&quot;/&gt;

Although the trousers of the current{{when|date=November 2013}} uniform of the United States Navy are still referred to as &quot;bell-bottomed&quot;, they simply have large straight legs. The sailor's thigh fills the upper trouser leg, making the bottom of the pants leg appear flared. This style has been popular for many years, perhaps because the trouser leg can be rolled up easily, allowing the sailor to work bare foot, but there is no reliable documentation that confirms a specific timeline or reason for the popularity of bell-bottomed trousers in naval apparel.&lt;ref name=&quot;dervis&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;mil&quot;&gt;{{cite document|author=Department of the Navy Bureau of Naval Personnel|url=http://www.history.navy.mil/library/online/uniform_history.htm|title=History of U.S. Navy Uniforms|chapter=Appendix 2|work=United States Navy Uniform Regulations|location=Washington, DC|publisher=US Government Printing Office|year=1981}} NavPers 15665D.&lt;/ref&gt;

===1960s and 1970s===
In the mid-1960s, bell-bottoms became fashionable for both men and women in Europe and North America.&lt;ref name=&quot;globe&quot;&gt;{{cite news|author=Cobb, Nathan|title=Bell-bottoms back, but the thrill is gone|newspaper=[[The Boston Globe]]|date=July 19, 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt; Often made of denim, they flared out from the bottom of the calf, and had slightly curved hems and a circumference of {{convert|18|in|cm}} at the bottom of each leg opening. They were usually worn with [[High-heeled footwear#Men and heels|Cuban-heeled]] shoes, [[Clog (shoe)|clogs]], or [[Chelsea boot]]s. [[Toni Basil]], who was a [[go-go dancing|go-go dancer]] when the 1964 concert film the ''[[T.A.M.I. Show]]'' was released, appeared in the film wearing bell-bottoms with a baby doll blouse.

[[Image:Redhead Beach Bell Bottoms.jpg|thumb|upright|1970s bell-bottoms]]
By 1967, bell-bottoms had moved from high fashion to part of the [[hippie]] counter-culture movement, a style exemplified by [[love beads]], granny glasses, and [[tie-dye]] shirts. Bell-bottoms are mentioned in the popular music single &quot;[[Bell Bottom Blues (Derek and the Dominos song)|Bell Bottom Blues]]&quot; by blues-rock group [[Derek and the Dominos]].

In the 1970s, bell-bottoms moved back into mainstream fashion;&lt;ref name=&quot;globe&quot;/&gt; [[Sonny and Cher]] helped popularize bell-bottoms in the US by wearing them on [[The Sonny &amp; Cher Comedy Hour|their popular television show]].&lt;ref name=&quot;globe&quot;/&gt; The pants were typically flared from the knee down, with bottom leg openings of up to twenty-six inches. Made from denim, bright cotton and satin polyester, they were so popular that they became a symbol of the outlandish and colorful style of the decade..&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/Bell-Bottoms.aspx |title=Bell-Bottoms Facts |publisher=Encyclopedia.com |year=2004 |accessdate=2012-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Loon pants'' (shortened from &quot;balloon pants&quot;) were a variant on bell-bottomed trousers, with an increased flare. They were worn occasionally by go-go dancers on the British television music variety show ''[[Ready Steady Go!]]'' in 1966.

''Elephant bells'', popular in the mid-to-late 1970s, were similar to loon pants, but were typically made of [[denim]]. Elephant bells had a marked flare below the knee, often covering the wearer's shoes. The preferred shoes were [[platform shoes]] with [[sole (shoe)|soles]] at least {{convert|2|in|cm}} thick and heels {{convert|4|to|5|in|cm}} to keep the pants' hems off the ground.

Today, original bell-bottoms from the 1960s and 70s are collectible [[vintage clothing]].

===1990s and 2000s===
In 1996, women's bell-bottoms were reintroduced to the mainstream public, under the name &quot;boot-cut&quot; (&quot;boot-fit&quot;) trousers as the flare was slimmer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/171385/Fashions-Year-In-Review-1996 |title=Fashions: Year In Review 1996 |accessdate=19 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1997, flare jeans had come into vogue among women,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.retrowaste.com/1990s/fashion-in-the-1990s/ |title=Fashion in the 1990s |accessdate=19 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; which had a wider, more exaggerated flare than boot-cuts (boot-fits). The boot-cut (boot-fit) style ended up dominating the fashion world for 10 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://content.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,2011254_2014381_2014372,00.html |title=Skinny Jean |work=Time |accessdate=19 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

By around 2006, the bell-shaped silhouette started to fade as the skinny jean rose in popularity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Skinny legs and all: Jeans get slender|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/life/lifestyle/2006-04-16-skinny-jeans_x.htm|work=USA Today|accessdate=19 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sharon Haver, the founder of FocusOn-Style commented &quot;It's as if all the girls wearing premium boot-cut (boot-fit) jeans threw them away one day, and the next day began wearing skinny jeans and flats.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://seattletimes.com/html/living/2003051369_fashjeans.html |title=Wearer beware of &quot;mom jeans&quot; |accessdate=19 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, boot-cuts (boot-fits) and flare jeans never entirely went away, and both of these styles remain relatively popular today both in denim fashion and higher-quality office wear.

Women's boot-cut jeans are tighter at the knee than men's, and flare out from knee to hem. Men's styles are traditionally straight-legged, although the pants came in a more flared style in the early and mid 2000s, but this was optional. The bell-bottoms of the 1960s and 1970s can be distinguished from the flare or boot-cut (boot-fit) of the 1990s and 2000s by the tightness of the fabric at the knee.

[[File:Dresscode.JPG|thumb|Dress code sign outside the [[Sheikh Zayed Mosque]] in [[Abu Dhabi]]]]
'''Dress codes''' are written and, more often, [[unwritten rule]]s with regard to [[clothing]]. Clothing like other aspects of human [[physical appearance]] has a social significance, with different rules and expectations being valid depending on circumstance and occasion.
 an individual may need to navigate between two or more dress codes, at a minimum these are those that apply at their place of work and those at home, usually this ability is a result of cultural acclimatization. Different societies and cultures will have different dress norms although Western styles are commonly accepted as valid.

The dress code has built in rules or signals indicating the message being given by a person's clothing and how it is worn. This message may include indications of the person's gender, [[income]], occupation and [[social class]], political, ethnic and religious affiliation, [[attitude (psychology)|attitude]] towards comfort, fashion, traditions, gender expression, marital status, sexual availability, and sexual orientation, etc. Clothes convey other social messages including the stating or claiming [[Identity (social science)|personal]] or [[cultural identity]], the establishing, maintaining, or defying [[group (sociology)|social group]] [[Norm (sociology)|norms]], and appreciating comfort and functionality.

For example, wearing expensive clothes can communicate [[wealth]], the [[image]] of wealth,  or {{clarify|text=[[Outlet store|cheaper access]]|date=January 2016}} to quality clothing. All factors apply inversely to the wearing of inexpensive clothing and similar goods. The observer sees the resultant, expensive clothes, but may incorrectly perceive the extent to which these factors apply to the person observed. (cf. [[conspicuous consumption]]). Clothing can convey a social message, even if none is intended. {{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}

If the receiver's code of interpretation differs from the sender's code of communication, misinterpretation follows.
&lt;!--  Commented out because image was deleted: [[File:Groom-and-flower.jpg|thumb|A well-groomed appearance and personal style is variously interpreted]] --&gt;
In every culture, current [[fashion]] governs the manner of consciously constructing, assembling, and wearing clothing to convey a social message. The rate of change of fashion varies, and so modifies the style in wearing clothes and its accessories within months or days, especially in small social groups or in communications media-influenced modern societies. More extensive changes, requiring more time, money, and effort to effect, may span generations. When fashion changes, the messages communicated by clothing change.

===Europe===
{{See also|Sumptuary laws}}
In the [[Middle Ages]], the [[:Category:European nobility|European royalty and nobility]] used a dress code to differentiate themselves from other classes of people.

===The Americas===
The [[indigenous peoples of the Pacific Northwest Coast]] had a complex social structure, including slaves, commoners, and nobles, and dress codes to indicate these social distinctions. [[John R. Jewitt]], an Englishman who wrote a memoir about his years as a captive of the [[Nuu-chah-nulth people]] in 1802-1805, describes how, after some time living there, [[Maquinna]] and the chiefs decided that he must now be &quot;considered one of them, and conform to their customs&quot;. Jewitt resented the imposition of this dress code, finding the loose untailored garments very cold, and attributed to them a subsequent illness of which he almost died.  He was not allowed to cut his hair, and had to paint his face and body as a Nootka would.&lt;ref&gt;''A Narrative of the Adventures and Sufferings of John R. Jewitt, only survivor of the crew of the ship Boston, during a captivity of nearly three years among the savages of Nootka Sound: with an account of the manners, mode of living, and religious opinions of the natives.''[http://www.canadiana.org/ECO/mtq?id=328920feff&amp;doc=90038 digital full text here] p161 onwards&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gender===
{{See also|Cross-dressing}}
In some traditions, certain types of clothing are worn exclusively or predominantly by either men or women.  For example, the wearing of a [[skirt]] tends to be associated with female dress, while [[trousers]] are associated with male dress (Although common for both genders). [[Hairdressing]] in some societies may also conform to a dress code, such as long hair for women and short hair for men. Some headgear are usually geared towards women, such as hair-clips, hairpins, and [[barette]]s (hair clasps).

===Social status===
[[File:ChineseEmperorChienLungbyGeorgeSStuart.jpg|thumb|160px|Emperor Chien Lung; by George S. Stuart]]
[[File:Ming Dynasty royal attire.jpg|thumb|160px|Formal attire for the Emperor and Empress of the Ming Dynasty&lt;ref&gt;Note that the golden-colored YiShanGuan (翼善冠, lit. 'Winged Crown of Philanthropy') the male model wears is historically incorrect: according to archaeological findings at the Tomb of [[Wanli Emperor]] (明定陵, ''MingDingLing'', lit. 'The Mausoleum of Tranquility of Ming') - the golden version of YiShanGuan was only worn by deceased emperors as part of the burial ritual; a living emperor on the other hand, always wore the YiShanGuan made of black silk with decorative jewels and dragons, therefore a 'black' version of it instead of gold. A historical fact not widely known in modern day China, thus the misrepresentation of the Ming Royal Attire in the photo above.&lt;/ref&gt;]] 
In many societies, particular clothing may be a [[status symbol]], reserved or affordable to people of high rank. For example, in [[Ancient Rome]] only senators were permitted to wear garments dyed with [[Tyrian purple]]; and, in [[Culture of the Native Hawaiians|traditional Hawaiian]] society, only high-ranking chiefs could wear [[feather cloak]]s and [[palaoa]] or carved whale teeth. In [[China]] before the establishment of the [[Republic of China|republic]], only the emperor could wear yellow.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}{{dubious|date=November 2015}}

In 1996, former U. S. President [[Bill Clinton]] announced his support for the idea of [[school uniform]]s by stating, “School uniforms are one step that may help break the cycle of violence, truancy and disorder by helping young students understand what really counts is what kind of people they are.”  Many [[school districts]] in the United States took up the idea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bowen|first=Sherry|title=Should Kids Wear School Uniforms?|url=&lt;http://www.eduguide.org/article/should-kids-wear-school-uniforms&gt;|publisher=EduGuide|accessdate=September 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  By requiring students to wear a school [[uniform]] they are less likely to have something to make fun of other students for. This would cause the students to get to know one another by their personality and who they really are rather than the clothes they wear.

===Occupation===
Military, police, and firefighters usually wear [[uniform]]s, as do workers in many industries. School children often wear [[school uniform]]s, while college and university students sometimes wear [[academic dress]]. Members of religious orders may wear uniforms known as '''[[religious habit|habits]]'''. Sometimes a single item of clothing or a single accessory can declare one's occupation or rank within a profession.

===Ethnic and political affiliation===
In many regions of the world, [[national costume]]s and styles in clothing and ornament declare membership in a certain village, caste, religion, etc. A Scotsman declares his clan with his [[tartan]]. A French peasant woman identified her village with her cap or [[coif]]. A Palestinian woman identifies her village with the pattern of [[Palestinian handicrafts#Embroidery and weaving|embroidery]] on her [[Palestinian costumes|dress]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Dispossessed: The Ordeal of the Palestinians |last=Gilmour |first=David |year=1983 |publisher=Sphere Books |location=London |page=83}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Clothes can also proclaim dissent from cultural norms and mainstream beliefs, as well as personal independence. In 19th-century Europe, artists and writers lived ''[[Bohemianism|la vie de Bohème]]'' and dressed to shock: [[George Sand]] in men's clothing, female emancipationists in [[bloomers (clothing)|bloomers]], male artists in velvet [[waistcoat]]s and gaudy neckcloths. [[Bohemianism|Bohemians]], [[beatnik]]s, [[hippie]]s, [[Goth subculture|Goths]], [[Punk subculture|Punks]], and [[Skinhead]]s have continued the ([[counter-culture|countercultural]]) tradition in the 20th-century [[Western Culture|West]].

===Religious affiliation===
[[File:TiraMarket.jpg|thumb|Mannequins with traditional Muslim [[veil]] at a Saturday market in [[Tira, Israel]].]]
A [[Sikh]] or [[Muslim]] man may display his religious affiliation by wearing a [[turban]] and other traditional clothing. Many Muslim women wear head or body coverings (see [[sartorial hijab]], [[hijab]], [[burqa]] or [[niqab]], [[chador]], and [[abaya]]) that proclaim their status as respectable women and cover the so-called [[intimate parts (Islam)|intimate parts]]. A [[Jew]]ish man may indicate his observance of [[Judaism]] by wearing a [[Kippah]].

===Marital status===
{{See also|Visual markers of marital status}}

Traditionally, [[Hindu]] women wear ''[[sindoor]]'', a red powder, in the parting of their hair to indicate their married status; if widowed, they abandon ''sindoor'' and jewelry and wear simple white clothing.  However, this is not true of all Hindu women; in the modern world this is not a norm and women without sindoor may not necessarily be unmarried.

In many [[Orthodox Jewish]] circles, married women wear head coverings such as a hat, [[snood (headgear)|snood]], or wig. Additionally, after their marriage, Jewish men of [[Ashkenazi]] descent begin to wear a [[Tallit]] during prayer.

Men and women of the Western world may wear [[wedding ring]]s to indicate their married status, and women may also wear [[engagement ring]]s when they are engaged.

==Laws and social norms==
{{Main|Clothing laws by country}}
{{Expand section|date=June 2008}}
[[File:DDR Nude Beach model.jpg|thumb|Model of a nude beach in the DDR Museum, Berlin]]
In [[New Guinea]] and [[Vanuatu]], there are areas where it is customary for the men to wear nothing but [[penis sheath]]s in public - this is uncommon in more developed areas. Women wear [[string skirt]]s. In remote areas of [[Bali]], women may go [[toplessness|topless]]. In America and some parts of Europe, there are [[nude beach]]es.

In the [[United States]], a few businesses or restaurants display dress code signs requiring shoes and shirts, claiming to be there on account of a health code,{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}} although no such health codes exist.&lt;ref name=&quot;barefoot society&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.barefooters.org/health-dept/ |title=Bare Feet and the Health Department |publisher=Barefooters.org |date=2010-01-24 |accessdate=2013-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, it is a common belief that there are laws against driving barefoot. However, no such laws exist. It is quite uncommon for people to be nude in public in the [[United States]]. However, there are a few private beaches and resorts that cater to people who wish to be naked.

==Private dress codes==
[[File:LondonClubDressCode bordercropped.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Dress code for a private club in [[Soho]], [[London]]]]

Private organisations may insist on particular dress codes or standards in particular situations.

* Religious bodies may insist on their standards of [[modesty]] being followed at their premises and events.
* Employees are sometimes required to wear a [[uniform]] or certain standards of dress, such as a business suit or tie. This may depend on particular situations, for example if they are expected to interact with customers. (see also [[International standard business attire]]) These policies vary depending on the industry with [[lawyers]], [[bankers]], and [[Executive (management)|executives]] often wearing suit and tie. Some work places require that [[tattoo]]s be covered.
* Patrons of a [[disco]] or [[nightclub]] are sometimes expected to dress in a particular style, such as [[clubwear]]; and [[bouncer (doorman)|bouncer]]s of a disco or nightclub at times refuse entrance to those whose clothing they consider not consistent with the atmosphere of the venue.
* Patrons of a [[casino]], shop, or restaurant are usually expected to dress to a minimum standard, such as [[smart casual]].
* The organisers of some parties sometimes specify a costume or theme for the event, such as a [[naked party]] or [[toga party]].
* [[Fetish club]]s often require patrons to dress in [[fetish fashion|fetish clothing]] or else all in black.

Dress codes function on certain social occasions and for certain jobs. A [[military]] institution may require specified [[uniform]]s; if it allows the wearing of plain clothes it may place restrictions on their use.

A &quot;formal&quot; or [[white tie]] dress code typically means tail-coats for men and full-length evening dresses for women. &quot;Semi-formal&quot; has a much less precise definition but typically means an evening jacket and tie for men (known as [[black tie]]) and a dress for women.  &quot;Business casual&quot; typically means not wearing [[neckties]] or [[suit (clothing)|suit]]s, but wearing instead collared shirts, and more ''country'' trousers (not black, but more ''relaxed'', including things such as [[corduroy]]).  &quot;Casual&quot; typically just means clothing for the torso, legs and shoes.  &quot;Wedding Casual&quot; defines yet another mode of dress, where guests dress respectfully, but not necessarily fancily. The [[uniform]] may consist of various items that are appropriate length and style depending on what the school suggests: for example, khaki pants or [[shorts]], plaid skirts, a button-up collared shirt, a sweater, a [[coat (clothing)|coat]] and [[Necktie|tie]] and even [[socks]]. Some schools have each grade assigned a color type which communicates what grade the student is currently in. That way if a student is lost someone is able to figure out what [[Educational stage|grade]] they are in just by looking at the color of their shirt. If the student is younger, older students and faculty are able to look out for them and make sure they are safe.
Organisations which seek to maintain standards of [[modesty]] have difficulties with [[Sheer fabric|sheer]] and [[see-through clothing]].

Dress codes usually set a lower limit on body covering. However, sometimes it can specify the opposite: for example, in UK gay jargon, ''dress code'', means people who dress in a militaristic manner. ''Dress code'' nights in nightclubs, and elsewhere, are deemed to specifically target people who have militaristic fetishes (e.g. leather/[[skinhead]] men).

==Education==
===Noncommunicative and communicative dress===
Noncommunicative dress code violations in public schools are violations that are without implications of hate, gang-affiliation, etc.&lt;ref name=&quot;Herbon, Beth 2000&quot;&gt;Herbon, Beth, and Jane E. Workman. &quot;Dress and Appearance Codes in Public Secondary School Handbooks.&quot; Journal of Family &amp; Consumer Sciences 92.5 (2000): 68-76.&lt;/ref&gt; Communicative dress code violations are violations of an explicit nature, where the clothing has implications of hate, violence, gang-affiliation, etc.&lt;ref name=&quot;Herbon, Beth 2000&quot;/&gt;

===Dress code violations and the courts===
In cases where dress code rules in public school systems have been violated by noncommunicative clothing, courts repeatedly legitimise dress code discrimination based on [[gender]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Smith, Natalie 2012&quot;&gt;Smith, Natalie. &quot;Eliminating Gender Stereotypes in Public School Dress Codes: The Necessity of Respecting Personal Preference.&quot; ''Journal of Law &amp; Education''; 41.1 (2012): 251-60.&lt;/ref&gt; Amongst the [[transgender]] populations, gender based dress codes are primarily enforced against individuals who are biologically able to remain within their own gender group,{{clarify|date=November 2015}} but that may wish to transcend to another gender. &lt;ref name=&quot;Smith, Natalie 2012&quot;/&gt;

==Work place==
White collar work place clothing has changed significantly through the years. In a corporate office, appropriate clothes are clean, business casual clothes such as a [[dress shirt]], [[polo shirt]], and [[trousers]], or other similar outfits. [[Suit (clothing)|Suit]]s, [[neckties]], and other formal wear are usually only required in law offices and financial sector offices.  Previous business dress code eras (the 1950s in the U.S.) featured standardized business clothes that strongly differentiated what was acceptable and unacceptable for men and women to wear while working. Today, the two styles have merged; women's work clothes expanded to include the suit (and its variants) in addition to the usual dresses, skirts, and blouses; men's clothes have expanded to include garments and bright colours. {{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}

Casual wear entered business culture with the advent of the Silicon Valley, California, technology company featuring casual work clothes on the job. Additionally, some companies set aside days — generally Fridays (&quot;dress-down Friday&quot;, &quot;[[casual Friday]]&quot;) — when workers may wear casual clothes.  The clothing a company requires its worker to wear on the job varies with the occupation and profession.

Some businesses observe that anti-discrimination law restricts their determining what is appropriate and inappropriate workplace clothing. Yet, in fact, most businesses have much authority in determining and establishing what work place clothes they can require of their workers. Generally, a carefully drafted dress code applied consistently does not violate anti-discrimination laws.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ppspublishers.com/biz/dresscode.htm Dress Code Legal Issues]. Personnel Policy Inc. Last accessed November 20, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Business casual===
{{Main|Business casual}}
''Business casual'' dress, also &quot;smart casual&quot;, is a popular work place dress code that emerged in [[White-collar worker|white-collar]] workplaces in [[Western world|Western countries]] in the 1990s, especially in the United States and Canada. Many [[information technology]] businesses in [[Silicon Valley]] were early adopters of this dress code. In contrast to formal business wear such as [[suit (clothing)|suits]] and [[neckties]] (the [[international standard business attire]]), the business casual dress code has no generally accepted definition; its interpretation differs widely among organizations and is often a cause of sartorial confusion among workers.

The [[job search engine]] [[Monster.com]] offers this definition: ''In general, business casual means dressing professionally, looking relaxed, yet neat and pulled together''. A more pragmatic definition is that business casual dress is the mid ground between formal business clothes and street clothes. Examples of clothing combinations considered appropriate for work by businesses that consider themselves as using the business-casual dress code are:

* for men: a shirt with a collar ([[polo shirt]]) and [[cotton]] [[trousers]] (or &quot;khakis&quot; in [[American English]]).
* for women: a tennis shirt and trousers.

Generally, neckties are excluded from business casual dress, unless worn in nontraditional ways. The acceptability of blue [[jeans]] and denim cloth clothing varies — some businesses consider them to be sloppy and informal.

==Inverse dress codes==
Inverse dress codes, sometimes referred to as &quot;[[undress code]]&quot;, set forth an upper bound, rather than a lower bound, on body covering. An example of an undress code is the one commonly enforced in modern communal bathing facilities. For example, in the public bath [[SchwabenQuellen]], no clothing of any kind is allowed in the sauna part of the resort. Other, less strict undress codes are common in public pools, especially indoor pools, in which shoes and shirts are disallowed.

Places where [[social nudity]] is practiced may be &quot;clothing optional,&quot; or nudity may be compulsory, with exceptions. See [[issues in social nudity]].

==Violation of clothing taboos==
Some clothing ''[[faux pas]]'' may occur intentionally for reasons of [[fashion]] or personal [[preference]]. For example, people may wear intentionally oversized clothing. For instance, the [[adolescence|teenage]] boys of [[hip hop culture|rap]] duo [[Kris Kross]] of the early 1990s wore all of their clothes backwards and extremely baggy.

==Rebellion against dress codes ==
Social attitudes to clothing have brought about various rules and social conventions, such as keeping the body covered, and not showing underwear in public. The backlash against these social norms has become a traditional form of rebellion.  Over time, western societies have gradually adopted more casual dress codes in the workplace, school, and leisure.  This has especially been the case since the early 1960s.

[[Image:NehruY.gif|thumb|200px|[[Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru]] in a ''achkan'' or [[sherwani]], a garment which served as a model for the Nehru jacket.]]
The '''Nehru jacket''' is a hip-length tailored coat for men or women, with a [[mandarin collar]], and with its front modelled on the [[India]]n [[achkan]] or [[sherwani]], an apparel worn by [[Jawaharlal Nehru]], the [[Prime Minister]] of [[India]] from 1947 to 1964. Ironically, Nehru himself rarely wore the jacket named after him,{{citation needed|date=June 2015}} preferring the more traditional sherwani/achkan or Western-style [[suit and tie]].

==History==
The apparel was created in India in the 1940s as ''Band Gale Ka Coat'' (English: &quot;Closed Neck Coat&quot;) and has been popular on the [[Indian subcontinent]] since, especially as the top half of a suit worn on formal occasions.

==Style==
[[File:Maharana of Udaipur Arvind Singh Mewar.jpg|thumb|right|Indian prince [[Arvind Singh Mewar]] wearing pinstripe Nehru jacket]]
Unlike the achkan, which falls somewhere below the knees of the wearer, the Nehru jacket is shorter, resembling a military-style jerkin.

==Popularity==
The jacket began to be marketed as the ''Nehru jacket'' in the Europe and America in the mid 1960s. It was briefly popular there in the late 1960s and early 1970s, its popularity spurred by growing awareness of foreign cultures, by the [[minimalism]] of the [[Mod (subculture)|Mod lifestyle]] and, in particular, by [[the Beatles]] and subsequently [[the Monkees]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1G2-3425500603.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://everything2.com/title/Nehru+jacket |title=Nehru jacket - Everything2.com |publisher=Everything2.com |date=2001-07-27 |accessdate=2010-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several villains in the [[James Bond in film|''James Bond'' film series]], including [[Julius No|Dr. No]], [[Karl Stromberg]] and [[Kamal Khan]], appear wearing a Nehru jacket.

==Decline of popularity in the West==
Once thought to be a possible new standard for formal wear for men (perhaps even replacing the [[Tuxedo]]), the Nehru jacket instead fell rapidly in popularity within just a few years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fashionencyclopedia.com/fashion_costume_culture/Modern-World-Part-II-1961-1979/Nehru-Jacket.html |title=Nehru jacket |accessdate=2015-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In India, the Nehru jacket continues to be popular and is often termed &quot;band-gala&quot; (i.e. closed-neck). The suit worn by [[Narendra Modi]], the prime minister of India, on the occasion of a state visit by [[Barack Obama]] in 2015 was widely discussed and eventually auctioned for $695,000.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/chi-india-obama-tree-modi-suit-20150220-story.html India says Obama's tree not dead, just looks it; PM's suit sells for $695K, Chicago Tribune, Feb 20, 2015]&lt;/ref&gt;

In some countries, a '''baby shower''' is a way to celebrate the pending or recent birth of a child by presenting gifts to the mother at a party, whereas other cultures host a baby shower to celebrate the transformation of a woman into a mother.
[[File:Special occasion cakes (baby shower).jpg|thumb|Baby shower cake (note that the coverlet is turned back waiting for the new baby)]]

==Etymology==
The term ''shower'' is often assumed to mean that the expectant mother is &quot;showered&quot; with gifts. The related custom [[bridal shower]] may have derived its name from the custom in Victorian times for the presents to be put inside a [[Parasol#China|parasol]], which when opened would &quot;shower&quot; the bride-to-be with gifts.&lt;ref name=&quot;SOSBIntro&quot;&gt;{{cite book

 | pages =  26
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
[[File:Teatime in Los Angeles.jpg|thumb|left|Cake and [[finger food]]s are often served at baby showers.]]
Traditionally, baby showers were given only for the family's first child, and only women were invited.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5n9RMTOzZOAC&amp;pg=PA153&amp;dq=baby+shower+history+and+tradition&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=nNNAU_C4FIKMrgf48oCICA&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=baby%20shower%20history%20and%20tradition&amp;f=false | title=The Complete Illustrated Pregnancy Companion | publisher=Fair Winds | author=Robin Elise Weiss | year=2009 | location=153 | pages=320 | isbn=1616734434}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to etiquette authority [[Miss Manners]], because the party centers on gift-giving,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nfIWAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT499&amp;dq=baby+shower+gift-giving&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=29ZAU9u9EYjmrAfkwIGgDQ&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=baby%20shower%20gift-giving&amp;f=false | title=Anthropology: The Human Challenge | publisher=Cengage Learning | author=William Haviland, Harald Prins, Dana Walrath, Bunny McBride | year=2013 | location=456 | pages=784 | isbn=1285677587}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [http://www.dileksbabyshower.com baby shower] is typically arranged and hosted by a close friend rather than a member of the family, since it is considered rude for families to beg for gifts on behalf of their members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url =http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/09/10/AR2010091005903.html |title =Miss Manners: Modesty is the best party policy |date =10 September 2010 |author =Martin, Judith |publisher =The Washington Post }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this custom varies by culture or region and in some it is expected and customary for a close female family member to host the baby shower, often the baby's grandmother.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WYWoAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA25&amp;dq=baby+shower+baby%27s+grandmother&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=ItVAU5SCG4j00gXx-IHwAg&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=baby%20shower%20baby's%20grandmother&amp;f=false | title=Understanding Chinese Society | publisher=Routledge | author=Xiaowei Zang | year=2012 | location=25 | pages=208 | isbn=1136632700}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When a baby shower is held after the birth of a baby, an invitation to attend the shower may be combined with a [[baby announcement]].

== Gifts ==
Guests bring small gifts for the expectant mother.  Typical gifts related to babies include [[diaper]]s, blankets, [[baby bottle]]s, clothes, and toys.  It is common to open the gifts during the party.

A possible decoration or gift is the baby diaper cake.  To make one, diapers and other typical baby supplies are arranged to look like a tiered [[wedding cake]].

== History ==
[[File:Baby shower shortbread biscuits 1 (8515549806).jpg|thumb|Baby shower shortbread biscuits]]
Baby shower as a term is relatively new, but the celebrations and rituals associated with pregnancy and childbirth are both ancient and enduring.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Ritual and Ceremony: A History of Baby Showers|url = http://www.randomhistory.com/2008/11/01_baby.html|website = www.randomhistory.com|accessdate = 2015-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ancient Egypt:''' Ancient Egyptians did not hold baby showers as we know them today, they did observe rituals associated with birth and pregnancy.

'''Ancient Greece:''' Ancient Greeks celebrated pregnancy after the birth of the child.

'''Middle Ages:''' Childbirth was associated with not only great physical danger but spiritual danger as well.

'''Renaissance:''' Childbirth was an almost mystical event, and mothers-to-be would often be surrounded with references to the Annunciation to encourage and celebrate her.

'''Victorian Era:''' Is the predecessor to modern-day baby shower. A Victorian woman would keep her pregnancy a secret as long as possible and would not appear in public due to cultural definitions of proper behavior.

'''Modern Era:''' The modern baby shower started after WWII during the baby boom era and evolved with the consumer ideology of 1950s and 1960s. In other words and served an economic function by providing the mother-to-be with material goods that lessened the financial burden of infant care.

'''Twenty-First Century:''' Several important changes associated with technology. Invitations, traditionally mailed, now are often emailed in elaborate graphically designed invitations. In addition, baby shower participants may attempt to identify baby parts on an ultrasound as a game, or even hold virtual baby showers.

Baby showers and other social events to celebrate the impending or recent birth are popular around the world. They are commonly &quot;women-only&quot; social gatherings.

* In [[Canada]], it is traditionally known that only women may attend this event. However, the twenty first century has changed this way of thinking and it is more common to see men at a shower, especially the father to be.
* In [[Bangladesh]], in many places a party named &quot;sadh&quot; (সাধ) or &quot;sadhbhokkhon&quot; (সাধভক্ষণ) is observed on the 7th month of pregnancy. After this the woman resides in the house of her father instead of the house of her husband till baby birth.
* In [[Brazil]], a party called &quot;chá de bebê&quot; (baby tea) is offered before birth and is often a &quot;women-only&quot; event.
* In [[Culture of China|Chinese]] tradition, a baby shower, called ''manyue'' (满月) is held one month after the baby is born. 
* In [[Hmong people|Hmong]] culture, a baby shower is called &quot;Puv Hli,&quot; and is held one month after the baby is born.  A ceremony would be hosted by the paternal grandparents or the father to welcome the baby to the family by tying the baby's wrist with white yarn and/or strings. 
* In [[Armenia]], a baby shower is called &quot;qarasunq&quot; (քառասունք) and is celebrated 40 days after baby's birth. It is a mixed party for all relatives and friends. Guests usually bring gifts for the baby or parents.
* In [[Iran]], a baby shower is called a &quot;sismoony party&quot;. It is celebrated 1–3 months before the baby's birth. Family and close friends give gifts intended for the baby such as a cot, toys and baby clothes.
* In [[Costa Rica]], a baby shower party is called ''té de canastilla'' (&quot;[[basket]] [[tea (meal)|tea]]&quot;).
* In [[Mongolia]], a baby shower is called &quot;хүүхдийн угаалга&quot; (huuhdyn ugaalga).
* In [[Hindu]] tradition, they are called by different names depending on the community the family belongs to.
**In northern [[India]] it is known as ''godbharaai'', in western India, especially [[Maharashtra]], the celebration is known as ''dohaaljewan'', and in [[West Bengal]] and [[Odisha]] it is called ''saadhroshi''.
**In Southern India, in [[Tamil Nadu]]/[[Andhra Pradesh]] it is called [[Seemantham]] or [[Valaikaapu]] or [[Poochoottal]] (The expecting mother wears bangles and adorned with flowers) and in [[Karnataka]] it is called ''Seemanta''(ಸೀಮಂತ) and is held when the woman is in her 5th or 7th or 9th month of pregnancy. Although Seemantham, Valaikappu and Poochoottal might be celebrated together, they are very different. Seemantham is a religious ceremony while Valaikappu and Poochoottal is a purely social event much like Western baby showers. In a Valaikappu and Poochoottal, there is music played, and the expecting mother is decked in traditional attire with lots of flowers and garlands made of [[jasmine]] or [[Jasminum sambac|mogra]]. A swing is decorated with flowers of her choice, which she uses to sit and swing. At times there are symbolic cut-outs of moons and stars that are put up. There are blessings showered on her by the elderly ladies from the household and community. Gifts are given to the expecting mother.
** In Gujarat, it is known as &quot; Seemant&quot; or &quot;Kholo Bharyo &quot;. It's religious rituals in most of Gujarati Hindus during 5th or 7th Month of pregnancy. A pregnant woman can only go to her father's home for delivery after her &quot; Seemant&quot;. Usually it's only for the first child. They offer special prayer and food to the goddess &quot;Randal, the wife of the Sun&quot;. 
**In [[Kerala]], it is known as 'Pulikudi' or 'Vayattu Pongala', and is practiced predominantly in the [[Nair]] community, though its popularity has spread to other Hindu sects as well over the years. On an auspicious day, after being massaged with homemade ayurvedic oil, the woman has a customary bath with the help of the elderly women in the family. After this, the family deity is worshipped, invoking all the ''paradevatas'' (family deities) and a concoction of [[herbal]] medicines prepared in the traditional way, is given to the woman. The woman is dressed in new clothes and jewellery used for such occasions. A big difference in the western concept of baby shower and Hindu tradition is that the Hindu ceremony is a religious ceremony to pray for the well-being of the baby. In most conservative families gifts are bought for the mother-to-be but not the baby. The baby is showered with gifts only after birth.
* In [[Islam]] adherents are required to perform [[aqiqah]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hidaya.org/social-welfare/aqiqah/what-is-aqiqah aqiqah]&lt;/ref&gt; of newly born child. This involves the sacrifice of animals. The meat is then divided in three equal parts; one for the poor and needy, one for relatives and friends which can involve inviting them at home for a feast, and finally the last part is utilized by the household itself.
* In [[South Africa]], a baby shower is called a ''stork party'', and takes place typically when the mother is about 6 months pregnant. Stork parties are usually not attended by men, and South African men do not have an equivalent party of their own. The stork party is accompanied by silliness such as dressing up, and gifts of baby supplies are given to the mother. A stork party is often organised as a surprise without the mother's knowledge.
* In [[Nepal]] a baby shower is known as &quot;dahi chiura khuwaune&quot;. The mother-to-be is given gifts from her elders and a meal is cooked for her according to her preferences. The pregnant mother is often invited by her relatives to eat meals with them. Pasni is a traditional celebration after the birth of the child, often marking the age of 6th months for a boy child and 5 months for a girl, often marking the transition to a diet higher in carbohydrates, and allowing the people attending to give their blessings, money and other gifts.
* In [[Guatemala]], only women attend this event. Middle class women usually celebrate more than one baby shower (one with close friends, co-workers, family, etc.).
* In [[Russia]], and [[Commonwealth of Independent States]], there are no baby showers, though some of the younger generation are starting to adapt it.
* In [[Serbia]], and [[Croatia]], there are no baby showers. Etiquette demands that one should never buy a baby gifts until it has been born. And when it is, make sure to call the newborn baby ugly. If you say anything good, the infant will be vulnerable to the evil eye. The party they throw for the baby typically happens 1 – 3 months after the baby is born and is called a ''Babine''

{{Culture of India}}

'''Clothing in India''' varies on the different [[ethnic]]ity, geography, climate and cultural traditions of the people of that region. Historically, male and female clothing has evolved from simple ''[[Langota]]s'', and [[loincloth]]s to cover the body to elaborate costumes not only used in daily wear but also on festive occasions as well as rituals and dance performances.&lt;!-- Clothing, along with accessories and [[embellishment]]s in [[India]], also indicates the religion, class and [[caste]] of a person.{{dubious|date=July 2012}} --&gt; In urban areas, western clothing is common and uniformly worn by people of all [[strata]]. India also has a great diversity in terms of weaves, fibers, colours and material of clothing. Colour codes are followed in clothing based on the religion and ritual concerned. For instance, [[Hindu]] ladies wear white clothes to indicate mourning, while [[Parsi]]s and Christians wear white to weddings. The clothing in India also encompasses the wide variety of [[Embroidery of India|Indian embroidery]].

== History ==
{{Main|History of clothing in India}}
[[File:Yakshini.jpg|right|thumb|upright|The Didarganj Yakshi depicting the ''dhoti wrap'']]

India's recorded history of clothing goes back to the 5th millennium BC in the [[Indus Valley civilization]] where [[cotton]] was spun, woven and dyed. Bone needles and wooden [[Spindle (textiles)|spindles]] have been unearthed in [[excavations]] at the site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.textileasart.com/weaving.htm | title=Weaving in Ancient India | accessdate=5 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cotton industry in ancient India was well developed, and several of the methods survive until today. [[Herodotus]], an ancient [[Greeks|Greek]] historian described Indian cotton as &quot;a wool exceeding in beauty and goodness that of sheep&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.thenagain.info/Classes/Sources/Herodotus.India.html | title=Herodotus on indian Cotton – Primary sources | publisher=www.thenagain.com | accessdate=5 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indian cotton clothing was well adapted to the dry, hot summers of the [[subcontinent]]. The grand epic [[Mahabharata]], composed by about 400 BC, tells of the god [[Krishna]] staving off [[Draupadi]]'s disrobing by bestowing an unending saree upon her.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://medium.com/indian-ethnic-fashion/6775fd474318 | title=Introduction to the Saree | publisher=Alvia Malik | accessdate=20 Dec 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=Personal/hobby blog post with unreliable dates, no references.|date=September 2015}} Most of the present knowledge of ancient Indian clothing comes from rock sculptures and paintings in cave monuments such as [[Ellora]]. These images show dancers and goddesses wearing what appears to be a dhoti wrap, a predecessor to the modern [[sari]].The upper castes dressed themselves in fine [[muslin]] and wore gold ornaments&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.payer.de/quellenkunde/quellen1102.htm | title=Megasthenes' indica | publisher=Tuepflis Global Village Library | accessdate=5 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Indus civilisation also knew the process of silk production. Recent analysis of Harappan silk fibres in beads have shown that silk was made by the process of [[Silk reeling|reeling]], a process known only to China until the early centuries AD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.nature.com/news/2009/090217/full/457945a.html | title=Rethinking Silk's origins | publisher=www.nature.com | accessdate=7 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the Greek historian [[Arrian]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.shsu.edu/~his_ncp/Indica.html | title=Indica(Arrian) on indian clothing | publisher=Sam Houston State University – TX | accessdate=5 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Gandhara Buddha (tnm).jpeg|thumb|upright|The [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]], in Greco-Buddhist style, 1st–2nd century CE, [[Gandhara]](Modern eastern Afghanistan).]]

&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;The Indians use linen clothing, as says Nearchus, made from the flax taken from the trees, about which I have already spoken. And this flax is either whiter in colour than any other flax, or the people being black make the flax appear whiter. They have a linen frock reaching down halfway between the knee and the ankle, and a garment which is partly thrown round the shoulders and partly rolled round the head. The Indians who are very well-off wear earrings of ivory; for they do not all wear them. Nearchus says that the Indians dye their beards various colours; some that they may appear white as the whitest, others dark blue; others have them red, others purple, and others green. Those who are of any rank have umbrellas held over them in the summer. They wear shoes of white leather, elaborately worked, and the soles of their shoes are many-coloured and raised high, in order that they may appear taller.&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Evidence from the 1st century AD shows some cultural exchanges with the Greeks. [[Indo-Greek]] influence is seen in the [[Greco-Buddhist art]] of the time. The Buddhas were portrayed as wearing the Greek [[himation]], which is the forerunner of the modern saṃghāti that forms a part of the [[Kasaya (clothing)|Kasaya]] of Buddhist monks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/499859?uid=3737496&amp;uid=2129&amp;uid=2&amp;uid=70&amp;uid=4&amp;sid=56294644393 | title=Gandhara and Early Christian Art: Buddha Palliatus | publisher=American Journal of Archaeology | accessdate=6 July 2012 | author=Benjamin Rowland, Jr.}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Maurya]] and [[Gupta]] period, the people continued to wear the three piece unstitched clothing as in Vedic times. The main items of clothing were the ''Antariya'' made of white cotton or muslin, tied to the waist by a [[sash]] called ''Kayabandh'' and a scarf called the [[Uttariya]] used to drape the top half of the body.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}

New trade routes, both overland and overseas, created a cultural exchange with Central Asia and Europe. Romans bought [[indigo]] for dyeing and cotton cloth as articles of clothing. Trade with China via the [[Silk road]] introduced silk textiles into India. The Chinese had a monopoly in the silk trade and kept its production process a trade secret. However, this monopoly ended when, according to legend, a Chinese princess smuggled [[mulberry]] seeds and silkworms in her headdress when she was sent to marry the king of [[Khotan]] (present day [[Xinjiang]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;Silk princess painting&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Silk Princess painting|url=http://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/asia/t/silk_princess_painting.aspx|work=British museum paintings|publisher=British Museum|accessdate=10 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  From there, the production of silk spread throughout Asia, and by AD 140, the practise had been established in India. [[Chanakya]]'s treatise on [[public administration]], the [[Arthashastra]] written around 3rd century BC, briefly describes the norms followed in silk weaving.&lt;ref name=&quot;Chanakya's Arthashastra&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=The removal of thorns|url=http://www.sdstate.edu/projectsouthasia/upload/Book-IV-The-Removal-of-Thorns.pdf|work=Arthashastra|publisher=South Dakota State University|accessdate=10 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:British Museum silk princess painting.jpg|thumb|centre|700px|Painting on wooden panel discovered by Aurel Stein in [[Dandan Oilik]], depicting the legend of the princess who hid silk worm eggs in her headdress to smuggle them out of China to the Kingdom of Khotan.]]

A variety of weaving techniques were employed in ancient India, many of which survive to the present day. Silk and cotton were woven into various designs and motifs, each region developing its distinct style and technique. Famous among these weaving styles were the [[Jamdani]], ''Kasika vastra'' of [[Varanasi]], ''butidar'' and the [[Ilkal saree]].{{citation needed|date=August 2012}} [[Brocade]]s of silk were woven with gold and silver threads and were deeply influenced by Persian designs. The [[Mughal Empire|Mughals]] played a vital role in the enhancement of the art, and the [[Paisley (design)|paisley]] and ''Latifa Buti'' are fine examples of Mughal influence&lt;ref name=&quot;Mughal Influence&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://indianembassy.ru/indiachronicle/jul08/culture.html | title=Indian Textile Art | author=Indian Embassy Russia | journal=Indian Chronicle}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dyeing of clothes in ancient India was practised as an art form. Five primary colours (''Suddha-varnas'') were identified and complex colours (''Misra – varnas'') were categorised by their many hues. Sensitivity was shown to the most subtlest of shades; the ancient treatise, [[Vishnudharmottara Purana|Vishnudharmottara]] states five tones of white, namely [[Ivory]], [[Jasmine]], August moon, August clouds after the rain and the conch shell.&lt;ref name=&quot;Vishnudharmottara&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=https://archive.org/download/vishnudharmottar031493mbp/vishnudharmottar031493mbp.pdf | title=Vishnudharmottara purana | accessdate=11 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The commonly used dies were [[indigo]](''Nila''), [[Common madder|madder red]] and [[safflower]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Ancient pigments&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://condor.depaul.edu/sjost/gph205/paint-pigments/dyes.htm | title=Dies used in Ancient india | publisher=DePaul university | accessdate=11 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|These were vegetable dies, commonly used in textiles. Non vegetable dies were also used such as ''gairika'' (red ochre), ''sindura'' (red lead), ''kajal'' (lampblack), sulphate of iron, sulphate of [[antimony]] and [[carmine]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Ancient pigments&quot;/&gt;}} The technique of [[mordant]] dyeing was prevalent in India since the second millennium BC.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mordant Dyeing&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.vam.ac.uk/content/articles/i/indian-textiles-introduction/ | title=Mordant dyeing in ancient india | publisher=Victoria and Albert museum | accessdate=12 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Resist dyeing]] and [[Kalamkari]] techniques were hugely popular and such textiles were the chief exports.

Integral to the history of Indian clothing is the [[Kashmiri shawl]]. Kashmiri shawl varieties include the [[Shahtoosh]], popularly known as the 'ring shawl' and the [[pashmina]] wool shawls, historically called ''pashm''. Textiles of wool finds mention as long back as the Vedic times in association with Kashmir; the Rig Veda refers to the Valley of Sindh as being abundant in sheep,{{citation needed|date=August 2012}} {{efn|The [[Rig Veda]], Mandala 10, hymn 75, mentions the valley of ''Sindhu'' as ''suvasa urnavati'' i.e home to plenty of sheep{{citation needed|date=August 2012}} }} and the god [[Pushan]] has been addressed as the 'weaver of garments',&lt;ref name=&quot;Kani &quot;/&gt; which evolved into the term ''pashm'' for the wool of the area.  Woolen shawls have been mentioned in Afghan texts of the 3rd century BC, but reference to the Kashmir work is done in the 16th century AD. The sultan of Kashmir, [[Zain-ul-Abidin]] is generally credited with the founding of the industry.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kashmir shawl history&quot;&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | title=Kashmir shawl | encyclopedia=Brittanica | accessdate=12 July 2012 | url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/312939/kashmir-shawl}}&lt;/ref&gt; A story says that the Roman emperor [[Aurelian]] received a purple [[pallium]] from a Persian king, made of Asian wool of the finest quality.{{citation_needed|date=October 2013}} The shawls were dyed red or purple, red dye procured from cochineal insects and purple obtained by a mixture of red and blue from [[indigo]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Ctesias&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.livius.org/ct-cz/ctesias/photius_indica.html | title=Summary of Ctesias' Indica | publisher=www.liviticus.org | accessdate=12 July 2012 | pages=section 39}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most prized kashmiri shawls were the [[Jamavar]] and the ''Kanika Jamavar'', woven using weaving spools with coloured thread called ''kani'' and a single shawl taking more than a year for completion and requiring 100 to 1500 ''kanis'' depending on the degree of elaboration.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kani &quot;&gt;{{cite book | title=Textiles, costumes and ornaments of Western Himalayas | publisher=Indus Publishing house | author=Omacanda Hāṇḍā | isbn=8173870764}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Indian textiles were traded from ancient times with China, Southeast Asia and the [[Roman Empire]]. The [[Periplus of the Erythraean Sea]] mentions [[mauve|mallow]] cloth, [[muslin]]s and coarse cottons.&lt;ref name=&quot;Periplus&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=https://archive.org/stream/periplusoferythr00schouoft#page/42/mode/2up | title=Periplus of the Erythraean Sea | accessdate=15 July 2012 | pages=42}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn| The Periplus states the various regions of production of cloth, including the Gangetic plain. Ancient Romans called Indian textiles by names such as ''gangetika'', nebula and ''venti'' meaning woven wind. [[Marco Polo]]'s Description of the world gives an idea of textile trade of the time, with a mention that Gujarat has the best textiles in the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;Periplus&quot;/&gt;}} Port towns like [[Masulipatnam]] and [[Barygaza]] won fame for its production of muslins and fine cloth.

In India, women's clothing varies widely and is closely associated with the [[Indian culture|local culture]], [[Indian religions|religion]] and [[Climate of India|climate]].

Traditional Indian clothing for women in the north and east are [[sari]]s worn with [[choli]] tops; a long skirt called a [[lehenga]] or pavada worn with choli and a [[dupatta]] scarf to create an ensemble called a [[gagra choli]]; or [[salwar kameez]] suits, while many south Indian women traditionally wear sari and children wear ''[[pattu langa]]''.{{citation needed| date=July 2012}}  Saris made out of silk are considered the most elegant. [[Mumbai]], formerly known as Bombay, is one of India's fashion capitals.{{citation needed| date=July 2012}} In many rural parts of India, traditional clothing is worn. Women wear a sari, a long sheet of colourful cloth, draped over a simple or fancy blouse.  Little girls wear a ''[[pavada]]''. Both are often patterned. [[Bindi (decoration)|Bindi]] is a part of women's make-up.{{citation needed| date=July 2012}} [[Indo-western clothing]] is the fusion of [[western culture|Western]] and [[South Asia|Subcontinental]] fashion. Other clothing includes the [[churidar]], [[gamucha]], [[kurti top|kurti]] and [[kurta]], and [[sherwani]].

The traditional style of clothing in India varies with male or female distinctions. This is still followed in the rural areas, though is changing in the urban areas.
Girls before puberty wear a long skirt (called langa/paawada in Andhra) and a short blouse, called a choli, above it.

;Mekhela Sador
{{Main|Mekhela chador}}

Mekhela Sador (Assamese: মেখেলা চাদৰ) is the traditional Assamese dress worn by women. It is worn by women of all ages.

There are three main pieces of cloth that are draped around the body.

The bottom portion, draped from the waist downwards is called the ''Mekhela'' (Assamese: মেখেলা). It is in the form of a sarong—very wide cylinder of cloth—that is folded into pleats to fit around the waist and tucked in. The folds are to the right, as opposed to the pleats in the Nivi style of the saree, which are folded to the left. Strings are never used to tie the mekhela around the waist, though an underskirt with a string is often used.

The top portion of the three-piece dress, called the ''Sador'' (Assamese: চাদৰ), is a long length of cloth that has one end tucked into the upper portion of the Mekhela and the rest draped over and around the rest of the body. The Sador is tucked in triangular folds. A fitted blouse is worn to cover the breasts.

The third piece is called a ''Riha'', which is worn under the Sador. It is narrow in width. This traditional dress of the Assamese women are very famous for their exclusive patterns on the body and the border. Women wear them during important religious and ceremonious occasions of marriage. Riha is worn exactly like a Sador and is used as ''Orni''.

==== Rajasthani safa ====

Turbans in [[Rajasthan]] are called ''pagari'' or &quot;safa&quot;. They are distinctive in style and colour, and indicate the caste, social class and region of the wearer. In the hot and dry regions, turbans are large and loose. The ''paggar'' is traditional in [[Mewar]] while the ''safa'' is to [[Marwar]].&lt;ref name=&quot;paggar&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://rajasthanfoundation.gov.in/culture-lifestyle.htm | title=Paggar and safa | publisher=www.rajasthanfoundation.gov.in | accessdate=15 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The colour of the ''pagaris'' have special importance and so does the ''pagari'' itself. In the past, saffron stood for valour and chivalry. A white turban stood for mourning. The exchange of a turban meant undying friendship.&lt;ref name=&quot;turban raj&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.rajasthanunlimited.com/artandcraft/turban.html | title=Pagaris | publisher=www.rajasthanunlimited.com | accessdate=15 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pagari&quot;&gt;{{cite book | title=The Rajputs of Rajputana: A glimpse into medieval Rajasthan | publisher=APH Publishing | author=M.S.

==== Gandhi cap ====

{{Main| Gandhi cap}}
The Gandhi cap, a white coloured cap made of [[khadi]] was popularised by [[Mahatma Gandhi]] during the [[Indian independence movement]]. The practice of wearing a Gandhi cap was carried on even after independence and became a symbolic tradition for politicians and social activists. The cap has been worn throughout history in many states such as [[Gujarat]], [[Maharashtra]], [[Uttar Pradesh]] and [[West Bengal]] and is still worn by many people without political significance. In 2013, the cap regained its political symbolism through the [[Aam Aadmi Party]], which flaunted Gandhi caps with &quot;I am a Common Man&quot; written over it. This was partly influenced by the &quot;I Am Anna&quot; caps used during [[Anna Hazare]]'s Lokpal movement. During the [[Delhi Legislative Assembly election, 2013]], these caps led to a scuffle between Aam Aadmi Party and Congress workers, based on the reasoning that Gandhi caps were being used for political benefits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.dnaindia.com/india/report-delhi-polls-aap-congress-workers-scuffle-over-gandhi-caps-1929488 | title=Delhi polls: AAP, Congress workers scuffle over Gandhi caps | publisher=DNA India | accessdate=3 Dec 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Bhaitika krital cropped.jpg|thumb|[[Tilaka|tilak]]  on a boy's forehead]]
Raksha Bandhan as a religious festival focuses on performing the [[aarti]] and saying prayers prior to tying the rakhi. The prayers draw inspiration from the Hindu scriptures. The other religious feature is the application of the [[Tilaka|tilak]]  on the forehead of the person wearing the rakhi.

===Significance===
Raksha Bandhan in [[Sanskrit]] literally means &quot;the tie or knot of protection&quot;.&lt;ref name=sp&gt;Sue Penney (2007), Hinduism, Heinemann Library, ISBN 978-1432903145, page 33&lt;/ref&gt; The word Raksha means protection, whilst Bandhan is the verb to tie. It is an ancient Hindu festival that ritually celebrates the love and duty between brothers and their sisters.&lt;ref name=rbht&gt;[http://www.hinduismtoday.com/blogs-news/hindu-press-international/raksha-bandhan-being-celebrated-across-india/13070.html Raksha Bandhan] Hinduism Today (August 2013)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gnanambal, K. (2008), Festivals on an All India Basis, Festivals In Indian Society, pp 65&lt;/ref&gt; The sister performs a ''Rakhi'' ceremony, then prays to express her love and her wish for the well being of her brother; in return, the brother ritually pledges to protect and take care of his sister under all circumstances. It is one of the several occasions in which family ties are affirmed in India.&lt;ref name=eoh&gt;J Gordon Melton (Editor), Religious Celebrations: An Encyclopedia of Holidays Festivals Solemn Observances and Spiritual Commemorations, ISBN 978-1598842067; pp 733-734&lt;/ref&gt;

The festival is also an occasion to celebrate brother-sister like family ties between cousins or distant family members,&lt;ref name=&quot;ref74param&quot;&gt;{{Citation | title=Folens religious education | author=Christine Moorcroft | publisher=Folens Limited, 1995 | isbn=978-1-85276-397-8 | url=http://books.google.com/books?id=yg-OXEpbWYcC | quote=''... sisters tie to their brothers' or male cousins' wrists ...'' | date=1995-03-31 | accessdate=2011-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; sometimes between biologically unrelated men and women.&lt;ref name=&quot;ref63hulul&quot;&gt;{{Citation | title=The cyclopaedia of India and of eastern and southern Asia, Volume 2 | author=Edward Balfour | publisher=B.

It is observed in the Hindu calendar month of [[Shraavana|Śrāvaṇa]], and typically falls in August every year.&lt;ref name=eoh/&gt;&lt;ref name=rbht/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Arora, P.

===Description and rituals===
[[File:Raksha Bandhan festival threads.jpg|thumb|left|Women shopping for ''Rakhi'', the ceremonial thread marking brother-sister love, before the Raksha Bandhan festival.]]
The festival is marked by the several rituals, which vary regionally within India. Typical rituals include:
;Prepare for Raksha Bandhan
Days or weeks before Raksha Bandhan, women shop for Rakhi, the ceremonial thread to tie around her brother's (or brother-like friend's) wrist. Some women make their own Rakhi.&lt;ref&gt;Bobbie Kalman, India - The Culture, Crabtree Publications, ISBN 978-0778792871, page 21&lt;/ref&gt; A Rakhi may be a simple thread, woven and colorful; or a Rakhi may be intricate with amulets and decoration on top of it. Sometimes, a Rakhi may be a fancy wrist watch or men's wrist accessory in the form of bracelet or jewelry. Rakhi in the form of a colorful woven thread is most common. Typically the brother(s) too shop for gifts for the sister, ahead of Raksha Bandhan. The gift from the brother can be a simple thoughtful token of love, and may be more elaborate.&lt;ref name=eoh/&gt;&lt;ref name=mv&gt;Manish Verma (2010), Fasts &amp; Festivals Of India, Diamond Books, ISBN 978-8171820764; pp 40-41&lt;/ref&gt;

;Rakhi ritual
On the morning of Raksha Bandhan, the brothers and sisters get together, often in nice dress in the presence of surviving parents, grandparents and other family members. If the sister and brother are geographically separated, the sister may mail the Rakhi ahead of the Raksha Bandhan day, along with a greeting card or letter wishing her brother well. The ritual typically begins in front of a lighted lamp (''diya'') or candle, which signifies fire deity. The sister and brother face each other. The sister ties the Rakhi on her brother's wrist.&lt;ref name=eoh/&gt;

Once the Rakhi has been tied, the sister says a prayer for the well being - good health, prosperity and happiness - for her brother. This ritual sometimes involves an aarti, where a tray with lighted lamp or candle is ritually rotated around the brother's face, along with the prayer and well wishes.

The prayer is a self composed note, or one of many published ''Rakhi'' poems and prose.&lt;ref&gt;Satvinder Kaur, Sarojini Naidu's poetry, Sarup &amp; Sons, ISBN 81-7625-428-2, pp 302-305&lt;/ref&gt; One of the earliest examples of a ''Rakhi'' prayer is found in Book V, Chapter V of [[Vishnu Purana]]; it is the prayer that ''Yasoda'' says while tying a ''Raksha Bandhan'' amulet on Krishna's wrist.&lt;ref&gt;Horace Hayman Wilson (1868), The Vishńu Puráńa: a system of Hindu mythology and tradition, Volume 4, Editor: Fitzedward Hall, Trubner &amp; Co., London, pp 276-278&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Vishnu Purana - Book 5, Chapter 5, Verses 14-23&lt;/ref&gt; An abridged form of the prayer is:
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;
''May the lord of all beings protect you,''
''May the one who creates, preserves and dissolves life protect thee,''

''May Govinda guard thy head; Kesava, thy neck; Vishnu, thy belly;''
''the eternal Narayana, thy face, thine arms, thy mind, and faculties of sense;''

''May all negativity and fears, spirits malignant and unfriendly, flee thee;''
''May Rishikesa keep you safe in the sky; and Mahidhara, upon earth.''
&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

After the prayer, the sister applies a ''[[Tilaka|tilak]]'' (Tikka), a colorful mark on the forehead of the brother. After the ''[[Tilaka|tilak]]'', the brother pledges to protect her and take care of his sister under all circumstances.&lt;ref name=eoh/&gt;&lt;ref name=sp/&gt;

The sister then feeds the brother, with her hands, one or more bites of [[mithai|sweets]] (desserts), dry fruits and other seasonal delicacies.&lt;ref name=sp/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Desiree Webber et al., Travel the Globe: Story Times, Activities, and Crafts for Children, Libraries Unlimited, ISBN 978-1610691246, pp 132-133&lt;/ref&gt;

;Gifts and hugs
The brother gives his sister(s) gifts such as cards, clothes, money or something thoughtful. The brother may also feed his sister, with his hands, one or more bites of sweets, dry fruits and other seasonal delicacies. They hug, and the larger family ritually congratulate the festive celebration of brother-sister love and protection.&lt;ref name=eoh/&gt;&lt;ref name=mv/&gt;

The brother(s) wear the Rakhi for the entire day, at school or work, as a reminder of their sister(s) and to mark the festival of Raksha Bandhan.&lt;ref&gt;Roger Whiting, Religions for Today, ISBN 978-0748705863, Dufour, page 182&lt;/ref&gt;

===Myths and parables===
The scriptures, epics of Hinduism is peppered with stories of ''Rakhi'' and ''Raksha Bandhan''. Some of these include:

====Indra Dev====
According to Hindu scripture [[Bhavishya Purana]], in the war between Gods and demons, [[Indra]] - the deity of sky, rains and thunderbolts - was disgraced by the powerful demon King [[Bali (demon)|Bali]]. Indra’s wife Sachi consulted [[Vishnu]], who gave her a bracelet made of cotton thread, calling it holy.&lt;ref name=ssehgel/&gt; Sachi tied the holy thread around Indra wrist, blessed with her prayers for his well being and success. Indra successfully defeated the evil and recovered Amaravati. This story inspired the protective power of holy thread.&lt;ref name=sp/&gt;&lt;ref name=mv/&gt;&lt;ref name=scfi&gt;[http://www.raksha-bandhan.com/legends-of-rakhi.html The Legends of Rakhi] The Society for the Confluence of Festivals in India (2012)&lt;/ref&gt; The story also suggests that the Raksha Bandhan thread in ancient India were [[amulet]]s, used by women as prayers and to guard men going to war, and that these threads were not limited to sister-brother like relationships.&lt;ref name=ssehgel/&gt;

====King Bali and Goddess Laxmi====
According to this legend, credited to Hindu scriptures [[Bhagavata Purana]] and [[Vishnu Purana]], after Vishnu won the three worlds from the demon King Bali, he was asked by Bali that Vishnu live in his palace, a request Vishnu granted. Vishnu's wife, Goddess [[Lakshmi]] did not like the palace or his new found friendship with Bali, and preferred that her husband and she return to [[Vaikuntha]]. So she went to Bali, tied a ''Rakhi'' and made him a brother. Bali asked her what gift she desired. Lakshmi asked that Vishnu be freed from the request that he live in Bali's palace. Bali consented, as well accepted her as his sister.&lt;ref&gt;Prem Bhalla, Hindu Rites, Rituals, Customs and Traditions: A to Z on the Hindu Way of Life, Pustak Mahal, ISBN 978-8122309027&lt;/ref&gt;

====Santoshi Ma====
[[Ganesh]] had two sons, Shubh and Labh. On Raksha Bandhan, Ganesh's sister visited and tied a ''Rakhi'' on Ganesh's wrist. The two boys become frustrated that they have no sister to celebrate Raksha Bandhan with. They ask their father Ganesh for a sister, but to no avail. Finally, saint Narada appears who persuades Ganesh that a daughter will enrich him as well as his sons. Ganesh agreed, and created a daughter named [[Santoshi Ma]] by divine flames that emerged from Ganesh's wives, ''Ruddhi'' (Amazing) and ''Siddhi'' (Perfection). Thereafter, Shubh Labh (literally &quot;Holy Profit&quot;) had a sister named Santoshi Ma (literally &quot;Goddess of Satisfaction&quot;), who loved and protected each other.&lt;ref name=&quot;ref21bamev&quot;&gt;{{Citation | title=Ganesh: studies of an Asian god | author=Robert L.

====Krishna and Draupadi====
Krishna considered Draupadi his friend. When Krishna cut his finger while beheading Shishupal, Draupadi immediately tore off a piece of her sari and bandaged his cut. Krishna said that with this loving act, she wrapped him in debt and he would repay each “thread” when the time arrives. Indeed, whenever Draupadi needed Krishna’s protection she fervently prayed for his help, he came to the rescue and gave her unlimited cloth. This is one of the stories of the origin of the Raksha Bandhan festival.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

In the epic [[Mahabharat]], [[Draupadi]] tied a ''Rakhi'' to [[Krishna]], while [[Kunti]] tied her ''Rakhi'' to her grandson Abhimanyu, before the great war.&lt;ref name=scfi/&gt;

====Yama and the Yamuna====
According to another legend, [[Yama]], the god of Death had not visited his sister [[Yamuna in Hinduism|Yamuna]] for 12 years. Yamuna, the goddess of Yamuna river, was sad and consulted Ganga, the goddess of Ganga river. Ganga reminded Yama of his sister, upon which Yama visits her. Yamuna was overjoyed to see her brother, and prepared a bounty of food for Yama. The god Yama was delighted, and asked Yamuna what she wanted for gift. She wished that he, her brother should return and see her again soon. Yama was moved by his sister's love, agreed and to be able to see her again, made river Yamuna immortal. This legend is the basis for a Raksha Bandhan-like festival called Bhai Duj in some parts of India, which also celebrates brother-sister love, but near [[Diwali]].&lt;ref&gt;Mark Fox and Olga Fox, Time to Celebrate: Identity, diversity and belief, ISBN 978-1-86366-703-6, Curriculum Corporation&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Roshen Dalal (2011), Hinduism: An Alphabetical Guide, Penguin, ISBN 978-0143414216, page 64&lt;/ref&gt;

====Rakhi and its colour significance====
[[File:Threads of love rakhi, Raksha Bandhan Hindus Sikhs Jains India.jpg|thumb|Rakhi threads on sale in India.]]
Each colour has a significance in this festival. Tagore used white, so white signifies friendship. Indrani used red for her husband Indra, so red signifies Love and loyalty. The last Orange and Yellow is most popular in India used by Laxmi and Yamuna for their brothers Bali and Yama so this colour is used for brothers.

==Multicultural festival==
[[File:Rakhi tied to a man's wrist Hindu Festival celebrated in Mauritius.jpg|thumb|Raksha Bandhan is celebrated in some Hindu, Jain and Sikh communities outside India. Above, Rakhi tied to a man's wrist in [[Mauritius]].]]

===Celebration===
Raksha Bandhan is viewed as a non-denominational,&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=uqvpZutXN7cC&amp;pg=PA148&amp;dq=raksha+bandhan+secular&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CFAQ6AEwCTgKahUKEwjOh5SEh93HAhXCOxoKHfXLBl4#v=onepage&amp;q=raksha%20bandhan%20secular&amp;f=false Shashi Tharoor (2007) Elephant, Tiger &amp; Cellphone]&lt;/ref&gt; multicultural event.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/hinduism/holydays/raksha.shtml Raksha Bandhan (Rakhi)] BBC Religion (2011)&lt;/ref&gt; Priests tie rakhis around the wrists of congregation members. Rakhis are often shared between close friends. Women tie rakhis around the wrists of the heads of state, political party or social leaders. Ceremonies are also held to tie Rakhi around the wrists of soldiers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dayandnightnews.com/2012/08/bsf-soldiers-celebrated-rakhi-at-border-in-jammu/ BSF soldiers celebrated Rakhi at border in Jammu], India (2012)&lt;/ref&gt;

The festival honors relationships of siblings and is akin to [[Siblings Day|siblings day]] observed in the [[United States]]. The festival centres on the mutual bond of protection whereby siblings pray for each other's wellbeing.&lt;ref&gt;Helene Fulton (2015) Beware of False Religions &amp; Pagan Traditions Part 2, Part 2 [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=IaonCQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA111&amp;dq=influence+of+raksha+bandhan+on+siblings+day&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CCwQ6AEwAmoVChMIvIP3rt7bxwIV4qDbCh1XbgNq#v=onepage&amp;q=influence%20of%20raksha%20bandhan%20on%20siblings%20day&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Historical references===
The multicultural aspects of Raksha Bandhan can be gleaned from history dating back thousands of years. It has many myths and historic legends linked to it. For example, the [[Rajput]] queens practised the custom of sending rakhi threads to neighbouring rulers as a token of brotherhood.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mohammed Wajihuddin&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;dnaindia2009ksd&quot;&gt;{{Citation | title=Rakhi strengthens communal ties | author=Misbah Nayeem Quadri | newspaper=DNA India | date=August 5, 2009 | isbn=978-0-85229-760-5 | url=http://www.dnaindia.com/india/report_rakhi-strengthens-communal-ties_1279825 | quote=... But even today, in many cities across the country, Hindu girls tie rakhi on the wrist of youths they consider their brothers.| accessdate=2011-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Alexander the Great and King Puru====
According to one legendary narrative, when [[Alexander the Great]] invaded India in 326 BCE, Roxana (or Roshanak, his wife) sent a sacred thread to Porus, asking him not to harm her husband in battle. In accordance with tradition, [[King Porus|Porus]], the king of [[Kekaya|Kaikeya kingdom]], gave full respect to the rakhi. On the battlefield, when Porus was about to deliver a final blow to Alexander, he saw the rakhi on his own wrist and restrained himself from attacking Alexander personally.&lt;ref name=&quot;ref26vivup&quot;&gt;{{Citation | title=India cultures quarterly, Volume 25 | author= | publisher=School of Research, Leonard Theological College, 1968 | isbn= | url=http://books.google.com/books?id=BBvjAAAAMAAJ | quote=''...

====Rani Karnavati and Emperor Humayun====
Another controversial historical account is that of [[Rani Karnavati]] of [[Chittor]] and [[Mughal Emperor]] [[Humayun]], which dates to 1535 CE. When Rani Karnavati, the widowed queen of the king of Chittor, realised that she could not defend against the invasion by the Sultan of Gujarat, [[Bahadur Shah of Gujarat|Bahadur Shah]], she sent a Rakhi to Emperor [[Humayun]]. Touched, the Emperor immediately set off with his troops to defend Chittor.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.raksha-bandhan.com/history-and-significance-of-raksha-bandhan.html History and Significance of Raksha Bandhan] Raksha-Bandhan.com&lt;/ref&gt; Humayun arrived too late, and Bahadur Shah managed to sack the Rani's fortress. Although contemporary commentators and memoirs do not mention the Rakhi episode and some historians have expressed skepticism about it, it is mentioned in one mid-seventeenth century Rajasthani account.&lt;ref name=&quot;ref87lomuq&quot;&gt;{{Citation | title=Medieval India: from Sultanat to the Mughals, Volume 2 | author=Satish Chandra | publisher=Har-Anand Publications, 2005 | isbn=978-81-241-1066-9 | url=http://books.google.com/books?id=0Rm9MC4DDrcC | quote=''...

====Rabindranath Tagore and Rakhi====
[[Rabindranath Tagore]], the Indian Nobel Laureate for literature, invoked ''Raksha Bandhan'' and ''Rakhi'', as concepts to inspire love, respect and a vow of mutual protection between Hindus and Muslims during India's colonial era.&lt;ref&gt;Gaurav Pradhan, Rabindranath Tagore: Literary Concepts, APH Publishing, ISBN 978-8176482790, page 33&lt;/ref&gt; In 1905, the British empire [[Partition of Bengal (1905)|divided Bengal]], a province of British India on the basis of religion. Rabindra Nath Tagore arranged a ceremony to celebrate Raksha Bandhan to strengthen the bond of love and togetherness between Hindus and Muslims of Bengal, and urge them to together protest the British empire. He used the idea of Raksha Bandhan to spread the feeling of brotherhood. In 1911, British colonial empire reversed the partition and unified Bengal, a unification that was opposed by Muslims of Bengal. Ultimately, Tagore's Raksha Bandhan-based appeals were unsuccessful. Bengal not only was split during the colonial era, one part became modern [[Bangladesh]] and predominantly Muslim country, the other a largely Hindu Indian state of [[West Bengal]]. Rabindranath Tagore started Rakhi Mahotsavas as a symbol of Bengal unity, and as a larger community festival of harmony.&lt;ref&gt;K. S. Bharathi, Encyclopedia of Eminent Thinkers, see Tagore, ISBN 81-7022-684-8, page 14&lt;/ref&gt; In parts of West Bengal, his tradition continues as people tie ''Rakhis'' to their neighbors and close friends.&lt;ref&gt;AP Sharma, Famous Festivals of India, ISBN 978-81-87057-50-5, see Raksha Bandhan&lt;/ref&gt;

One of Tagore's poem invoking ''Rakhi'' is:&lt;ref&gt;Rabindranath Tagore, The Jewel that is Best: Collected Brief Poems, Penguin, ISBN 978-0-143415-633, page 118&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;
''The love in my body and heart''
''For the earth's shadow and light''
''Has stayed over years.''

''With its cares and its hope it has thrown''
''A language of its own''
''Into blue skies.''

''It lives in my joys and glooms''
''In the spring night's buds and blooms''
''Like a Rakhi-band''
''On the Future's hand.''
&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

====Maharaja Ranjit Singh====
Maharaja [[Ranjit Singh]] was the ruler of the [[Sikh Empire]] who actively encouraged inter-faith communication.&lt;ref&gt;Patwant Singh, Jyoti M. Rai (2013) Empire of The Sikhs: Revised Edition [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=9VFHCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT71&amp;lpg=PT71&amp;dq=secular+festivals+sikh+empire&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=HBGoPXvuuw&amp;sig=ZhS-ndAWd1sYOiBsgMXlzJRBty0&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CC4Q6AEwAmoVChMI_cLNptDdxwIVaETbCh3_MQEC#v=onepage&amp;q=secular%20festivals%20sikh%20empire&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt; Accordingly, he observed Raksha Bandhan&lt;ref&gt;Hari Ram Gupta (1978) History of the Sikhs: The Sikh lion of Lahore, Maharaja Ranjit Singh, 1799-1839 [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=-1huAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=maharaja+ranjit+singh+celebrated+raksha+bandhan&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=karahprasad+]&lt;/ref&gt; and his wife [[Jind Kaur|Maharani Jindan]], reinforced the harmony between the [[Sikh Empire]] and Nepal through the Rakhi festival.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=ZmM7AQAAIAAJ&amp;dq=raksha+bandhan+majarani+jinda&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=+majarani+jindan Indian Information, Volume 22 (1948)]&lt;/ref&gt; The bond was honored when Maharani Jindan was given refuge by [[Jung Bahadur Rana|Jang Bahadur]] of [[Nepal]] in 1849&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=pm_iAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=maharani+jindan+nepal+kings&amp;dq=maharani+jindan+nepal+kings&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CDcQ6AEwAmoVChMIg8rDmLjdxwIVQkoUCh1ZPAwj Prem Hari Har Lal (1993) The Doon Valley Down the Ages]&lt;/ref&gt; after the collapse of the [[Sikh Empire]] and annexation of its territories by the British.

===Rakhi with a unique gender twist===
In 2015, men tied rakhis on women seeking protection from the ‘misuse’ of section 498A of the [[Indian Penal Code]].&quot;Society has gone through massive changes in the last few decades and men are now considered on the same platform with women. Why should laws show a discrimination against them?&quot; asked Amartya Talukdar, founder member of Hridaya, an NGO working for gender neutrality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=TNN|title=On Rakhi, a unique gender twist|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/On-Rakhi-a-unique-gender-twist/articleshow/48728550.cms|accessdate=7 September 2015|issue=Kolkata|publisher=The Times of India|date=30 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Regional variations==
While Raksha Bandhan is celebrated in various parts of South Asia, different regions mark the day in different ways.

=== Kumaon region(Uttarakhand) ===
The people of the [[Kumaon division|Kumaon]] region of [[Uttarakhand]], celebrate Raksha Bandhan with Janopunyu (जन्यो पुन्यु). Along with the sister-brother ritual, men change their ''[[Upanayana|janeu]]'' (जनेयु or जन्यो, sacred thread). The region also marks the day with Bagwal fair at Devidhura in district [[Champawat]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.is/20130205003434/http://www.tourism-uttarakhand.com/janopunya-festivals.php |title=Janopunya Festival Uttarakhand Janopunya Festival Tour Uttarakhand Tourism Uttarakhand Fairs and Festivals Uttarakhand Tour Packages |publisher=Archive.is |date=2013-02-05 |accessdate=2013-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Indo Vacations Team |url=http://www.indovacations.net/english/UttarnchalFestival.htm |title=Uttaranchal, Information about Uttaranchal Festival, Uttaranchal Festivals |publisher=Indovacations.net |date= |accessdate=2013-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===West Bengal and Odisha(Orissa)===
In the state of [[West Bengal]] and [[Odisha]], this day is also called Jhulan Purnima. Prayers and puja of Lord Krishna and Radha are performed there. Sisters tie ''Rakhi'' to Brothers and wish immortality. Political Parties, Offices, Friends, Schools to colleges, Street to Palace celebrate this day with a new hope for a good relationship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://puriwaves.nirmalya.in/festivals/jhulan-purnima#Jhulan_Purnima |title=Jhulan Purnima &amp;#124; Puri Waves |publisher=Puriwaves.nirmalya.in |date=1934-08-10 |accessdate=2013-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nepal===
In Nepal, Raksha Bandhan is celebrated on shravan purnima. It is also called Janaeu Purnima (Janaeu is sacred thread and purnima means full moon). A sacred thread is tied on wrist by senior family members and relatives. Nepalese people enjoy this festival, eating its special food &quot;Kwati&quot;, a soup of sprout of seven different grains.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thehimalayantimes.com/fullNews.php?NewsID=254981&amp;headline=Janai+Purnima+today |title=Janai Purnima today - Detail News : Nepal News Portal |publisher=The Himalayan Times |date= |accessdate=2013-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://colorfulnepal.com/culture-and-religion/janai-purnima.html |title=Janai Purnima,nepal culture, nepal family festivals, nepal religionnepal tourism festivals |publisher=colorfulnepal.com |date= |accessdate=2013-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This day, in Nepal, people change Janai (जनै), which is a cord made of cotton threads worn diagonally on the torso, a [[Vedic ritual]]. People pay homage to deity Shiva and go on pilgrimage to places such as [[Gosainkunda]], [[Budhanilkantha]], [[Pashupatinath Temple, Mandsaur|Pashupatinath]], [[Kumbheshwor Temple]] among others.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

These Kolis offered prayers to Lord Varuna for invoking his blessings. As part of the Rakhi rituals, coconuts were thrown into the sea as offerings to Lord Varuna also they apply vermillion on each other's foreheads as a symbol of prosperity and joy

===Jammu(Kashmir)===

In the regions of [[North India]], mostly [[Jammu Division|Jammu]], it is a common practice to fly kites on the nearby occasions of Janamashtami and Raksha Bandhan.
Its not unusual to see the sky filled with kites of all shapes and sizes, on and around these two dates.
The kites start appearing in the sky around, (or sometimes even before) one month before the actual date of the festival.
As the date grows closer, the number of kites in the sky increases proportionally.
The locals buy kilometres of strong kite string, commonly called as &quot;Gattu Door&quot; in the local language, along with a multitude of kites.
They are willing to spend more than a couple thousands to buy the things that the need for this kite flying extravaganza.

[[File:Mens Coats 1872 Fashion Plate.jpg|right|thumb|Overcoat (left) and topcoat (right) from ''The Gazette of Fashion'', 1872.]]
An '''overcoat''' is a type of long [[coat (clothing)|coat]] intended to be worn as the outermost garment, which usually extends below the knee. Overcoats are most commonly used in winter when warmth is more important.

They are sometimes confused with or referred to as '''topcoats,''' which are shorter and end at or above the knees. Topcoats and overcoats together are known as '''outercoats'''. Unlike overcoats, topcoats are usually made from lighter weight cloth such as [[gabardine]] or covert, while overcoats are made from heavier cloth or [[fur]].

==History of the overcoat==
[[File:Major-General The Hon. James MacDonald large.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Double-breasted]] coat, 1876]]

In many countries, coats and gowns reaching below the knee have been worn for centuries, often for formal uses, establishing either social status or as part of a professional or military uniform. In the 17th century, the overcoat became widely stylised and available to the different classes.

In the West, the general profile of overcoats has remained largely unchanged for a long time.  During the [[British Regency|Regency]], the fashion was to have very form-fitting clothes, with sidebodies, waist seams, and a flared skirt. Examples of this included the [[frock overcoat]] and [[paletot]]. This gradually shifted to the looser styles more common now, typified by the [[Chesterfield coat]], which became popular by the end of the [[Victorian fashion|Victorian]] period. Until then, most coats were double breasted, but Chesterfields and accompanying styles like the guard's coat were worn in single and double breasted varieties.

More recently, there is a decline in the wearing of full-length overcoats, and double breasted ones are much less common.

==Military use of the overcoat==
[[File:Meissonier - 1814, Campagne de France.jpg|left|thumb|Napoleon, mounted, campaigning in France in 1814, wearing a grey overcoat, by [[Jean-Louis-Ernest Meissonier]].]]
Overcoats in various forms have been used by militaries since at least the late 18th century, and were especially associated with winter campaigns, such as [[Napoleon]]'s Russian campaign.  The full length overcoat was once again popularised by the use during World War I of the [[trench coat]].

Stereotypically, overcoats used by the army tended to be [[single-breasted]], while navies often used [[double-breasted]] overcoats. Overcoats continued to be used as battle dress until the mid-1940s and 1950s, when they were deemed impractical.  However, in colder countries, such as the former [[USSR]], they continue to be issued and used. When more efficient clothing and synthetic fibres became readily available, the overcoat began to be phased out even there.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}

When a 2008–2011 attempt to introduce military uniforms made of warm synthetic fibers was made in [[Russia]], it resulted in many [[Military of Russia|soldiers]] getting [[frostbite]] and [[pneumonia]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.militaryphotos.net/forums/showthread.php?191062-Russian-soldiers-freezing-in-new-uniform  Russian Soldiers Freeze in New Uniforms] militaryphotos.net&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Kaj Family reunion group 1988.jpg|thumb|1992 Swedish-American family reunion in [[Borlänge]] of people descending from a common ancestor born in 1776]]
A '''family reunion''' is an occasion when many members of an [[extended family]] congregate. Sometimes reunions are held regularly, for example on the same date of every year.

A typical family reunion will assemble [[grandparent]]s, great-grandparents and up for a meal, some recreation and discussion. The older attendees are generally grandparents, [[parent]]s, [[sibling]]s or [[Cousin|first cousin]]s while the youngest could be second, third or fourth cousins.  It is also not uncommon for regular family reunions to be sponsored by family organizations or [[family association]]s centered on a more distant common [[ancestor]] (often referred to as &quot;ancestral family organizations&quot;) or a commonly shared surname (&quot;single surname family organizations&quot;).

==Family reunion programs==
Family reunion programs are sponsored by Red Cross organizations. See the [[List of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies]]. The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) leads the international movement and which has special responsibilities under international humanitarian law.

==Adoption reunion movements==
Many adults using an [[adoption reunion registry]] are able to locate parents and siblings. Adoption Reunion groups offer search and support guidance for birth parents and adoptees.  Adoption Reunion organizations help to uphold adoptee rights and support adoption reform.  According to TRIADOPTION® Library &lt;ref name=&quot;TRIADOPTION Archives&quot;&gt;[http://www.triadoption.com/ Adoption Archives]&lt;/ref&gt; which kept records on adoption search and reunion beginning in the 1970s, Jean Paton formed Orphan Voyage back in 1954 and is considered the grandmother of the adoption reunion movement. ALMA (Adoptees Liberty Movement Association) was formed in New York City in 1972, ISRR ([[International Soundex Reunion Registry]]) in 1975, CUB ([[Concerned United Birthparents]]) in 1976, and dozens more sprung up around the US, Canada and Australia. By 1985 there were over 500 search and support organizations worldwide. The adoption reunion movement grew rapidly from grass roots local organizations coming together under forming the AAC (American Adoption Congress) in 1979 at a conference held in Washington, DC. Groups from each region were instrumental in finding ways to help their members reunite with their birth families and surrendered/relinquished children.

One of the early groups was Yesterday's Children in Illinois founded by Donna Cullom. They were instrumental in filing the first class action suit in 1974 on behalf of adoptees having access to their original records and birth certificates. In Canada, Parent Finders was formed by Joan Vanstone. Philadelphia Forum, Adoptees In Search, Search Triad, Operation Identity and so many others held meetings, gave support, assisted in search and offered education in their communities. Like them WARM (Washington Adoption Reunion Movement) was a non-profit organization providing search, reunion and educational resources and support to the adult adoption community. WARM maintains a collection of Orphan memorials dedicated to adoptees and birthparents who died before being reunited.

==National and international family history societies==
Many reunions are made possible by family history [[Family history society|societies]]. The [[Federation of Family History Societies]] (FFHS) is an international organisation based in the UK which represents, advises and supports over 220 family history societies. The Federation of East European Family History Societies (FEEFHS) was organized in 1992 as an umbrella organization that promotes family research. The Canadian Federation of Genealogical (CanFed) and Family History Societies work with Canadian born families.

==International family reunification==
Family reunification for third-country nationals remains a politically charged issue. The ICCPR (Art. 12.4) states openly the right of each person to enter in the country of her nationality. This statement has been open to variety of interpretation. Family reunification has become a controversial humanitarian and human rights issue as well as a much debated immigration policy issue. In 2015, North korea have plan that program of family reunion with South Korea. 

==Genealogy societies==
The purpose of [[genealogical societies]] is to form a community of researchers and help its members create a library of families history resources.
FGS was founded in 1976 and represents the members of more than 600 genealogical societies. 
Organizations like the African American Genealogical Society of Northern California assist family members connect the branches of the family tree using genealogy and Internet resources.

==Traditional family reunion activities==

Traditional family reunion activities include an afternoon luncheon or early evening dinner and program featuring music, song, poetry reading, history recitals, honorary recognition of elders, community contributions and educational achievements.

'''Historic skits'''
Reenactments that highlight pivotal points in a family’s history. Participants are introduced to the art of developing a timeline as well as period research with a focus on costume design, customs, dialogue and social, economic and technological developments.

'''Story telling'''
A fascinating art that brings to life tales of ancestors and their accomplishments. Along with stories of legends of the past, life lessons are taught. The meaning behind family traditions are shared while relaying important family history factoids and the ties that bind.

'''Genealogy tours'''
Takes the family on an exciting tour of important genealogical hot spots including the family homestead, the towns in which the family settled, the jobs they held, machines they worked, markets they traded and streets they walked as well as social activities they immersed themselves into.

'''Genealogy presentations'''
A Presentation of historic documents and vintage artifacts that identify timelines, economic status, historic events and locations of ancestors.

==Annual proclamations and observances==

'''Family Reunion Month'''
A Proclamation in 1985 To raise awareness of a growing trend of runaway children and newly formed organizations to help reunite families of runaways the Congress, by House Joint Resolution 64, has designated the period between Mother's Day, May 12, and Father's Day, June 16, 1985, as &quot;Family Reunion Month&quot; and authorized and requested the President to issue a proclamation in observance of this period.

'''National Family Reunion Month'''

[[File:Polo Shirt Basic Pattern.png|thumb|Polo shirt outline]]
A '''polo shirt''', also known as a '''golf shirt''' and '''tennis shirt''', is a form of shirt with a collar, a [[placket]] with typically two or three buttons, and an optional pocket.

All three terms may be used interchangeably.  Polo shirts are usually made of [[knitted fabric|knitted cloth]] (rather than [[woven]] cloth), usually [[Piqué (weaving)|piqué]] cotton or, less commonly, [[silk]], [[merino]] [[wool]], or [[synthetic fiber]]s. A [[dress]]-length version of the shirt is called a '''polo dress'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=McKean|first=Erin|title=The Hundred Dresses: The Most Iconic Styles of Our Time|year=2013|publisher=A &amp; C Black|location=USA|isbn=978-1-4725-3585-6|page=71|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=T1tY4jXQw08C&amp;pg=PA71&amp;dq#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== History of the tennis shirt ===
[[File:Tennis-shirt-lacoste.jpg|thumb|A [[Lacoste]] tennis shirt]]
In the 19th and early 20th centuries, [[tennis]] players ordinarily wore &quot;tennis whites&quot; consisting of long-sleeved white button-up shirts (worn with the sleeves rolled up), flannel [[trousers]], and [[necktie|ties]].&lt;ref name=&quot;fashenc-07&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fashionencyclopedia.com/Ki-Le/Lacoste-Sportswear.html|title=Lacoste Sportswear – Fashion Designer Encyclopedia|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;lacoste&quot;&gt;The Story of Lacoste. Retrieved from http://www.lacoste.com/library/pdf/LACOSTE_history_histoire.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;time-04&quot;&gt;Style &amp; Design: Lacoste. ''Time'' Magazine, Winter 2004. Retrieved from http://www.time.com/time/2004/style/111504/article/lacoste_on_a_lark_and_a08a.html.&lt;/ref&gt; This attire presented problems for ease of play and comfort.&lt;ref name=&quot;lacoste&quot; /&gt;

[[René Lacoste]], the [[France|French]] seven-time [[Grand Slam (tennis)|Grand Slam]] tennis champion, felt that the stiff tennis attire was too cumbersome and uncomfortable.&lt;ref name=&quot;lacoste&quot; /&gt; He designed a white, short-sleeved, loosely-knit [[Piqué (weaving)|piqué]] cotton (he called the cotton weave ''jersey petit piqué'') shirt with an unstarched, flat, protruding collar, a buttoned placket, and a  shirt-tail longer in back than in front (known today as a &quot;tennis tail&quot;; see below), which he first wore at the 1926 U.S. Open championship.&lt;ref name=&quot;fashenc-07&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;lacoste&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;time-04&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;brandch&quot;&gt;[http://www.brandchannel.com/features_profile.asp?pr_id=300 ''The Brand Channel'', Lacoste profile].&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning in 1927, Lacoste placed a crocodile emblem on the left breast of his shirts, as the American press had begun to refer to him as &quot;The Crocodile&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;The Crocodile&quot;&gt;[http://www.chansons-net.com/tennis/champions/lacoste/E-lacoste.html]''The Crocodile''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;The Birth of the Crocodile&quot;&gt;[http://www.lacoste.com/#/rene_lacoste-rub-1]''The Birth of the Crocodile''&lt;/ref&gt; a nickname which he embraced.&lt;ref name=&quot;fashenc-07&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;lacoste&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;time-04&quot; /&gt;

Lacoste's design mitigated the problems that traditional tennis attire created:&lt;ref name=&quot;fashenc-07&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;time-04&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;brandch&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Butterworth|first=Helen|title=The History of the Polo Shirt|url=http://www.polo-shirts.co.uk/guides/18/The_History_of_the_Polo_Shirt.html|accessdate=22 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* the short, cuffed sleeves solved the tendency of long sleeves to roll down
* the soft collar could be loosened easily by unbuttoning the placket
* the piqué [[collar (clothing)|collar]] could be worn [[upturned collar|upturned]] to protect the [[neck]] from the [[sun]]
* the jersey knit piqué cotton breathed and was more durable.
* the &quot;tennis tail&quot; prevented the shirt from pulling out of the wearer's trousers or shorts

In 1933, after retiring from professional tennis, Lacoste teamed up with [[André Gillier]], a friend who was a clothing merchandiser, to market that shirt in Europe and North America.&lt;ref name=&quot;fashenc-07&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;lacoste&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;brandch&quot; /&gt;  Together, they formed the company [[Lacoste|Chemise Lacoste]], and began selling their shirts, which included the small embroidered crocodile logo on the left breast.&lt;ref name=&quot;fashenc-07&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;lacoste&quot; /&gt;

[[File:Chakravarty Cup 2008.jpg|thumb|right|Polo players Paul Barry, [[Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha]], [[Adolfo Cambiaso]], [[Martin Valent]] with fellow player [[Prince William]] (center), wearing polo shirts as part of their uniform.]]
Before Lacoste’s 1933 mass-marketing of his tennis shirt, [[polo]] players wore thick long-sleeve shirts made of [[Oxford (cloth)|Oxford-cloth]] cotton.&lt;ref name=brooksbros&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brooksbrothers.com/aboutus/heritage.tem|title=Brooks Brothers – About Us|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This shirt was the first to have a buttoned-down collar, which polo players invented in the late 19th century to keep their collars from flapping in the [[wind]] ([[Brooks Brothers]]'s early president, John Brooks, noticed this while at a polo match in England and began producing such a shirt in 1896).&lt;ref name=&quot;brooksbros&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fashionencyclopedia.com/Bo-Ch/Brooks-Brothers.html ''Fashion Encyclopedia'', &quot;Brooks Brothers&quot;].&lt;/ref&gt; Brooks Brothers still produces this style of button-down &quot;polo shirt&quot;.&lt;ref name=brooksbros /&gt;  Still, like early tennis clothing, those clothes presented a discomfort on the field, and when polo players became aware of Lacoste’s invention in the 1930s they readily adopted it for use in polo.

In 1920, Lewis Lacey, a Canadian born of English parents in Montreal, Quebec in 1887, haberdasher and polo player, began producing a shirt that was embroidered with the logo of a polo player, a design originated at the [[Hurlingham Club (Argentina)|Hurlingham Polo Club]] near Buenos Aires.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Monday, Sept. 01, 1986 |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,962178,00.html |title=A Popular Shirt Tale |publisher=TIME |date=1986-09-01 |accessdate=2012-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!-- Image with inadequate rationale removed: [[File:Polo Ralph Lauren logo.png|thumb|200px|left|Polo Ralph Lauren symbol]] --&gt;
The term ''polo shirt'', which previously had referred only to the long-sleeved buttoned-down shirts traditionally used in polo, soon became a universal moniker for the tennis shirt; no later than the 1950s, it was in common usage in the U.S. to describe the shirt most commonly thought of as part of formal tennis attire. Indeed, tennis players often would refer to their shirt as a &quot;polo shirt,&quot; notwithstanding the fact that their sport had used it before polo did.

In 1972, [[Ralph Lauren]] included his &quot;polo shirt&quot; as a prominent part of his original line called [[Polo Ralph Lauren|Polo]], thereby  helping furthering its already widespread popularity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://about.ralphlauren.com/history/history.asp?year=1972 Official Ralph Lauren history website: &quot;1972&quot;].&lt;/ref&gt;  While not specifically geared for use by polo players, Lauren’s shirt imitated what by that time had become the normal attire for polo players. As he desired to exude a certain &quot;[[White Anglo-Saxon Protestant|WASPishness]]&quot; in his clothes, initially adopting the style of clothiers like Brooks Brothers, [[J. Press]], and &quot;[[Savile Row]]&quot;–style English clothing, he prominently included this attire from the &quot;sport of kings&quot; in his line, replete with a logo reminiscent of Lacoste’s [[crocodile]] [[emblem]], depicting a polo player and pony.  This worked well as a marketing tool, for subsequently, due to the immense popularity of Lauren’s clothing, a majority of English-speaking westerners began to refer to Lacoste’s tennis shirt as a &quot;polo shirt&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://about.ralphlauren.com/history/history.asp?year=1967 Official Ralph Lauren history website: &quot;1967&quot;].&lt;/ref&gt;  Still, &quot;tennis shirt&quot; remains a viable term for all uses of Lacoste’s basic design.

==== Golf ====
[[File:GFD Wearing Red Polo Shirt.jpg|thumb|An elderly golfer wearing a red polo shirt.]]
Over the latter half of the 20th century, as standard clothing in [[golf]] became more casual, the tennis shirt was adopted nearly universally as standard golf attire.&lt;ref name=&quot;fashenc-07&quot; /&gt; Many golf courses and country clubs require players to wear golf shirts as a part of their dress code.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.burleighgolfclub.com.au/guests/golf/dress.mhtml &quot;Dress Code&quot;], BURLEIGH HEADS GOLF CLUB&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.golflongislandnational.com/Club_Rules___Regulations.html &quot;Dress Code: Proper Golf Attire&quot;], Long Island National Golf Club&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, producing Lacoste’s &quot;tennis shirt&quot; in various golf cuts has resulted in specific designs of the tennis shirt for golf, resulting in the moniker &quot;golf shirt&quot;. Golf shirts are commonly made out of polyester, cotton and polyester blends, or mercerized cotton. The placket typically holds three or four buttons, and consequently extends lower than the typical polo neckline. The collar is typically fabricated using a stitched double-layer of the same fabric used to make the shirt, in contrast to a polo shirt collar, which is usually one-ply ribbed knit cotton. Golf shirts often have a pocket on the left side, to hold a scorepad and pencil, and may not bear a logo there.

[[File:C-Zone 20100702 Japan Expo 6.jpg|thumb|upright|The &quot;frock&quot; as dress, worn by a Japanese singer in 2010]]
'''''Frock''''' has been used since [[Middle English]] as the name for an article of [[clothing]] for men and women. In British English and in Commonwealth countries the word is used as an alternative term for a girl's or woman's [[dress]]. In Australia it is frequently used this way, with the phrase &quot;to frock up&quot; meaning to wear a formal dress or gown for a special occasion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.macquariedictionary.com.au/ |title=Macquarie Dictionary |accessdate=6 May 2013}} {{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Originally, a ''frock'' was a loose, long garment with wide, full [[sleeve]]s, such as the [[Religious clothing|habit]] of a [[monk]] or [[priest]], commonly belted.  (This is the origin of the modern term [[defrock]] or unfrock, meaning &quot;to eject from the [[clergy|priesthood]]&quot;.)

The term has been continually applied to various types of clothing, generally denoting a loosely fitted garment:

* From the 16th century to the early 20th century, ''frock'' was applied to a woman's [[Dress (garment)|dress]] or [[gown]], in the fashion of the day, often indicating an unfitted, comfortable garment for wear in the house, or (later) a light overdress worn with a [[Slip (clothing)|slip]] or underdress.
* From the 17th century on, a ''frock'' is a thigh- or full-length loose outer garment worn by [[shepherd]]s, workmen, and farm workers in [[United Kingdom|Britain]], generally of heavy [[linen]] with a broad flat [[collar (clothing)|collar]], now usually called a [[smock-frock]].  In some areas, this traditional frock buttons up the front in the manner of a [[coat (clothing)|coat]], while in others it is a pullover style.
* In the 18th century in Britain and [[United States|America]], a ''frock'' was an unfitted men's coat for hunting or other country pursuits, with a broad, flat collar, derived from the traditional working-class frock. Late in the 18th century it came to be made with a cutaway front without a waist seam and this may have evolved into the standard dress coat with horizontally cutaway fronts worn for daytime wear by the early 19th century and from which the modern [[tail coat]] for [[white tie]] is derived. The [[great coat]] may similarly be historically derived from the frock as it similarly is single breasted, with a high and broad collar, waist pockets, and also lacked a waist seam early in its history as can be seen in an example{{which|date=December 2015}} in the Victoria and Albert Museum, London.

The precise historical evolution of the frock after the second half of the 18th century is obscure, however it is likely that the frock was gradually supplanted by the frock coat in the early 19th century, eventually being relegated to evening dress.  The frock coat in turn became cut away into the modern coat, giving us the two modern coats with tails.

* ''Frock'' is also a woman’s or girl’s dress.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.in/books/about/Carefree_Clothes_for_Girls.html?id=aBOuvrYcX1AC  Carefree Clothes for Girls: 20 Patterns for Outdoor Frocks, Playdate Dresses, and More -book by Junko Okawa (Shambhala Publications, 2009)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/frock Oxford Dictionary meaning of Frock]&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Frock'' (especially in the phrase &quot;short frock&quot;) can be a child's dress or light overdress.
* A ''frock'' is a dense knitted overgarment worn by [[sailor]]s and [[fisherman|fishermen]], as ''guernsey frock'', ''jersey frock'' (now usually simply [[Guernsey (clothing)|guernsey]] and [[Jersey (clothing)|jersey]]).
* The name &quot;oil frock&quot; has been used for a type of sailor's [[oilskin]].

A [[frock coat]] is a men's [[Coat (clothing)|coat]] style of the 19th century, characterized by full skirts reaching to the lower thigh or knee. Despite the similarity in the name, the [[frock coat]] should be regarded as being a distinct garment quite separate from the frock. In the French language the [[frock coat]] is called 'une redingote' (from English &quot;riding coat&quot;), and so unlike the English language implies no immediate relationship to the frock which is called 'une fraque'. Indeed the modern French word for a tail coat is &quot;une frac&quot; which better betrays the historical relationship between the tail coat and the frock. In construction the [[frock coat]] could scarcely be more different from the frock for unlike the latter it is usually double breasted, lacks any pockets, lacks a high collar, has V-shaped lapels, is closely fitted and is constructed with a waist seam.

A '''frock motor''' is a [[Wheel hub motor|hub motor]] frequently fitted to [[electric bicycle]]s. Unlike belt or chain driven motors which can pose a hazardous entanglement risk to those wearing long or loose garments, the hub motor is laced into the center of the bicycle's wheel. With no fast moving parts near the rider's legs it poses little threat to those wearing frock-like garments. Frock motors are either internally geared or direct drive and come in various sizes depending on their power output. They are the most common type of electric bicycle motor and are fitted to millions of bicycles throughout China and around the world.

'''Krishna Janmashtami''' ([[Devanagari]] {{lang|sa|कृष्ण जन्माष्टमी}} {{IAST|kṛṣṇa janmāṣṭamī}}), also known as ''Krishnashtami'', ''Saatam Aatham'', ''Gokulashtami'', ''Ashtami Rohini'', ''Srikrishna Jayanti'', ''Sree Jayanti'' or sometimes simply as ''Janmashtami'', is an annual celebration of the birth of the [[Hinduism|Hindu]] deity [[Krishna]], the eighth [[avatar]] of [[Vishnu]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hindu.com/2008/08/24/stories/2008082458410200.htm|title=Sri Krishna Janamashtami celebrated in the city|work=The Hindu|date=24 August 2008|accessdate=12 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[List of Hindu festivals|festival]] is celebrated on the eighth day ([[Ashtami]]) of the [[Paksha#Krishna Paksha|Krishna Paksha]] (dark fortnight) of the month of [[Bhadrapad]] (August–September) in the [[Hindu calendar]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://hinduism.about.com/od/festivalsholidays/f/When-Is-Krishna-Janmashtami.htm Krishna Janmashtami]&lt;/ref&gt;''[[Rasa lila]]'', dramatic enactments of the life of Krishna, are a special feature in regions of [[Mathura, Uttar Pradesh|Mathura]] and [[Vrindavan]], and regions following [[Vaishnavism of Manipur|Vaishnavism in Manipur]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=In Pictures: People Celebrating Janmashtami in India |url=http://www.ibtimes.co.in/articles/372380/20120810/pictures-people-celebrating-janmashtami-india.htm |accessdate=10 August 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; While the ''Rasa lila'' re-creates the flirtatious aspects of Krishna's youthful days, the ''[[Dahi Handi]]'' celebrate God's playful and mischievous side, where teams of young men form human towers to reach a high-hanging pot of butter and break it. This tradition, also known as ''uriadi'', is a major event in [[Tamil Nadu]] on Gokulashtami. Krishna Janmashtami is followed by the festival [[Nandotsav]], which celebrates the occasion when [[Nanda Baba]] distributed gifts to the community in honour of the birth.&lt;ref&gt;Packert, Cynthia.

Krishna was the eighth son of [[Devaki]] and [[Vasudeva]].

(1972) [1922]. Ancient Indian Historical Tradition, Delhi: Motilal Banarsidass, pp.105–107.&lt;/ref&gt; and was the eighth son born to the princess Devaki and her husband [[Vasudeva]].

Mathura (in present day [[Mathura district]], Uttar Pradesh) was the capital of the [[Yadava]]s, to which Krishna's parents Vasudeva and Devaki belonged. King [[Kamsa|Kansa]], Devaki's brother,&lt;ref&gt;According to the Bhagavata and Vishnu Puranas, but in some Puranas like Devi-Bhagavata-Purana, her paternal uncle. See the Vishnu-Purana Book V Chapter 1, translated by H. H. Wilson, (1840), the Srimad Bhagavatam, translated by A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada, (1988) copyright Bhaktivedanta Book Trust&lt;/ref&gt; had ascended the throne by imprisoning his father, King [[Ugrasena]]. Afraid of a [[prophecy]] that predicted his death at the hands of [[Devaki]]'s eighth son, Kansa had the couple locked in a prison cell. After Kansa killed the first six children, and Devaki's apparent miscarriage of the seventh (which was actually a secret transfer of the infant to Rohini as [[Balarama]]), Krishna was born.

Following the birth, Vishnu ordered [[Vasudeva]] to take Krishna to [[Gokul]] to [[Nanda]] and [[Yashoda]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Mohapatra2013&quot;/&gt; where he could live safely, away from his Uncle Kansa. Vasudeva took Krishna with him and crossed the [[Yamuna]] to reach [[Gokul]]. There, everyone was asleep; so he quietly kept him there and returned with [[Yashoda]]'s daughter. Kansa, thinking her to be Devki's eight child, threw her on a stone. But she rose into the air and transformed into Yogmaya (who is Vishnu's helper) and warned Kansa about his death. Then, she disappeared.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mohapatra2013&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=J Mohapatra|title=Wellness In Indian Festivals &amp; Rituals: Since the Supreme Divine is manifested in all the Gods, worship of any God is quite legitimate.|url=http://books.google.co.in/books?id=R0aVAgAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA137#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|date=24 December 2013|publisher=Partridge Publishing|isbn=978-1-4828-1689-1|pages=137–139}}&lt;/ref&gt; Krishna grew up in Gokul with his brother, [[Balram]]. He then returned to [[Mathura]] and killed Kansa with the help of Balram.

==Celebrations==
Hindus celebrate Janmashtami by fasting, worshipping Krishna and staying up until midnight, the time when Krishna is believed to have been born. Images of Krishna's infancy are placed in swings and cradles in temples and homes. At midnight, devotees gather around for devotional songs, dance and exchange gifts. Some temples also conduct readings of the Hindu religious scripture [[Bhagavad Gita]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gibson|first1=Lynne|last2=Wootten|first2=Pat|title=Hinduism|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=jnwffnGT0tEC&amp;pg=PA40|year=2002|publisher=Heinemann|isbn=978-0-435-33618-9|page=40}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Maharashtra===
{{Main|Dahi Handi}}
Janmaashtami or  Gokulashtami, popularly known in [[Mumbai]] and [[Pune]] as ''Dahi Handi,'' is celebrated as an event which involves making a [[human pyramid]] and breaking an earthen pot (''handi'') filled with [[buttermilk]] (''dahi''), which is tied at a convenient height. The topmost person tries to break the ''handi'' by hitting it with a blunt object. When the ''handi'' breaks, the buttermilk is spilled over the entire group. This event is based on the legend of the child-god Krishna stealing butter. A participant in this festival is called a ''Govinda'' or ''Govinda pathak''.&lt;ref name=CNNDMello&gt;{{cite news|last1=DMello|first1=Daniel|title=8 incredible facts about Mumbai|url=http://travel.cnn.com/mumbai/life/8-incredible-facts-about-Mumbai-082838|accessdate=23 July 2014|work=CNN|date=4 October 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140729030959/http://travel.cnn.com/mumbai/life/8-incredible-facts-about-Mumbai-082838|archivedate=2014-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many such ''Govinda pathaks'' compete with each other, especially for the prize money. These groups are called ''mandals'' or ''handis'' and they go around the local areas, attempting to break as many pots as possible every August. The event, since the 2000s, has gathered a political flavour, and it is common for political parties and rich community groups to offer prizes amounting to [[lakhs]] of rupees.&lt;ref name=TOIMishra&gt;{{cite news|author1=Ambarish Mishra|author2=Nitin Yeshwantrao|author3=Bella Jaisinghani|title=Nine-tier handi breaks into Guinness Records|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/Nine-tier-handi-breaks-into-Guinness-Records/articleshow/15441796.cms?referral=PM|accessdate=23 July 2014|work=Times of India|date=11 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Local celebrities and [[Bollywood]] actors also participate. Some of the popular ''handis'' are at [[Dadar]], [[Lower Parel]], [[Worli]], [[Mazgaon]], [[Lalbaug]], [[Thane]] in Mumbai and Babu Genu, Mandai in Pune.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.mid-day.com/news/2008/aug/240808-janmashtami-celebrated.htm|title=Janmashtami celebrated with zeal, enthusiasm|work=Mid Day|date=24 August 2008|accessdate=12 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cash and gifts are offered for ''Govinda'' troops to participate; for over 4,000 ''handis'' in Mumbai, 2,000 ''Govinda'' troops compete for the prizes.&lt;ref name=&quot;TOIMishra&quot;/&gt;

The coastal state of [[Goa]](see:[[Gomanta Kingdom]]) has been associated with the [[Yadavas]].Known as ''Ahstam'' in Goa,celebrated with great zeal on family level as well as community levels,especially in the temples of ''Devaki Krishna''(perhaps the only temple dedicated to [[Devaki]] in India) and [[Naroa]],the ancient town of Kadambas.

===Northern and Eastern India===
Places in [[Uttar Pradesh]] that are associated with Krishna's childhood, such as [[Mathura]], [[Gokul]] and [[Vrindavan]], attract visitors from all over India, who go there to participate in the festival celebrations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kishore|first=B.

In [[Jammu]], kite flying is an important part of the celebration on his day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Festival of Kite Flying in Jammu|url=http://www.jammu.com/jammu/fairs/kite-flying.htm |accessdate=10 August 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the eastern state of [[Odisha]], in the region around [[Puri]] and in [[Nabadwip]], [[West Bengali]] people celebrate Janmashtami by fasting and worship until midnight. Purana Pravachana from the [[Bhagavata Purana]] are recited from the 10th Skandha. This section deals with pastimes of [[Krishna]]. The next day is called &quot;Nanda Utsav&quot; or the joyous celebration of Krishna's foster parents [[Nanda]] and [[Yashoda]]. On this day, people break their fast and offer various cooked sweets during the early hours.

They chant slokas from the Bhagavad Gita and sing religious songs called bhajans. The temples of Lord Krishna are decorated, and bhajans and kirtans are sung or played. The Krishna Mandir in Patan Durbar Square, Narayanhiti Krishna Mandir, and other temples of Lord Krishna are the centres for festivities on Krishna Janmaasthimi. Numerous devotees flock to the ancient Krishna temple in Old Patan Durbar Square to keep vigil through the revered night of his birth. Observances include people sitting closely together, bodies rocking as women chant the many names of Lord Krishna, such as Narayan, Narayan and Gopal, Gopal. Some sing hymns, others clap their hands while some others pray.

There they offer flowers, coins and food, and wait for a glimpse of the Krishna Janmashtami idol. After the temple priest gives them prasad, they make their way home.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sri Krishna Janmashtami Nepal|url=http://www.rabinsxp.com/2012/08/sri-krishna-janmashtami-nepal.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fiji's Janmastami celebrations are unique in that they last for eight days, leading up to the eighth day, the day Krishna was born. During these eight days, Hindus gather at homes and at temples with their 'mandalis,' or devotional groups at evenings and night, and recite the [[Bhagavat Purana]], sing devotional songs for Krishna, and distribute Prasadam. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hindus Mark Birth of Lord Krishna |url=http://fijisun.com.fj/2015/09/06/hindus-mark-birth-of-lord-krishna}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''fashion accessory''' is an item used to contribute, in a secondary manner, to the wearer's [[clothing|outfit]], often used to complete an outfit and chosen to specifically complement the wearer's look.&lt;ref name=&quot;CummingCunnington2010&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author1=Valerie Cumming|author2=C. W. Cunnington|author3=P. E. Cunnington|title=The Dictionary of Fashion History|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=FFsTqayaUNYC&amp;pg=PA70|accessdate=9 January 2012|date=15 November 2010|publisher=Berg|isbn=978-1-84788-533-3|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term came into use in the 19th century.

==Types==
Fashion accessories can be loosely categorized into two general areas: those that are carried and those that are worn. Traditional carried accessories include purses and [[handbags]], [[hand fan]]s, [[parasol]]s and [[umbrellas]], [[wallets]], [[canes]], and [[sword|ceremonial swords]]. Accessories that are worn may include [[jackets]], [[boots]] and [[shoes]], [[cravats]], [[Necktie|ties]], [[hat]]s, [[bonnet (headgear)|bonnets]], [[belt (clothing)|belts]] and [[suspenders]], [[gloves]], [[muff (handwarmer)|muffs]], [[jewelry]], [[watches]], [[sash]]es, [[shawls]], [[scarves]], [[socks]], and [[stockings]].&lt;ref name=&quot;CummingCunnington2010&quot;/&gt;

==History==
In [[Victorian fashion]] accessories such as fans, parasols and gloves held significance for how women experienced gender, race and class. In this era, there was a trend for women to adopt, or aspire to, a more leisurely lifestyle. Consequently, gloves were often used by women to cover their hands and mask any signs of labor.&lt;ref name=&quot;Beaujot&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author1=Ariel Beaujot|title=Victorian Fashion Accessories|url=http://www.allenandunwin.com/default.aspx?page=94&amp;book=9781847886828|accessdate=10 May 2013|date=June 2012|publisher=Berg|isbn=9781847886828|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also, in the early 16th century in Italy hat badges were worn by civilian men of a higher social status as decorative item, in imitation of the [[cap badges]] worn by the invading military. Hat badges were often worn in conjunction with a decorative sword and hilt. Hat badges were fashioned after [[plaquette]]s and often depicted a scene with personal relevance to the wearer.&lt;ref name=&quot;Leino&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author1=Marika Leino|title=Fashion, Devotion and Contemplation : The Status and Functions of Italian Renaissance Plaquettes|url=http://www.peterlang.com/index.cfm?event=cmp.ccc.seitenstruktur.detailseiten&amp;seitentyp=produkt&amp;pk=50260&amp;concordeid=11068|accessdate=10 May 2013|date=7 December 2012|publisher=Peter Lang AG|isbn=9783039110681|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bhai Dooj(भाई दूज)''' / '''Bhau-Beej''' / '''Bhai Tika''' / '''[[Bhai Phonta]](ভাইফোঁটা)''' is a festival celebrated by [[Hindu]]s of [[India]] and [[Nepal]] on the last day of the five-day-long [[Diwali]] or [[Tihar (festival)|Tihar]] festival. This is the second day of the bright fortnight or [[Shukla Paksha]] of the Hindu lunar month of [[Kartika (month)|Kartika]] in [[Nepali Calendar]].

The celebrations of this day are similar to the festival of [[Raksha Bandhan]]. On this day, sisters pray for a long and happy life for their brothers, by performing the [[tilaka|Tika]] ceremony.

==Regional names==
The festival is known as:
 
*'''Bhai Dooj''' ([[Hindi language|Hindi]]:भाई दूज) in entire Northern part of India, observed on the last day of the five-day [[Diwali (Deepavali)|Diwali]] festival. This is also the second day of the  Vikrami Samvat New Year, the calendar followed in Northern India (including Kashmir), which starts from the lunar month of Kārtika. The first day of this New Year is observed as [[Govardhan Pūja]].
*'''Bhai Tika''' ([[Nepali language|Nepali]]:भाई टीका) in Nepal, where it is the second most important festival after [[Dashain]] (Vijaya Dashmi / Dussehra). Observed on the third day from [[Tihar (festival)|Tyohar]] festival, it is widely celebrated by [[Newar people|Newari]], [[Maithali]], [[Tharu people|Tharu]], [[Bahun]] and [[Chhetri]] people. Also known as Bhai Dooj in Nepal, too.
*'''[[Bhai Phonta]]''' ([[Bengali language|Bengali]]:ভাই ফোঁটা) in Bengal and it takes place every year on the first or the second day of the [[Kali Puja]] festival.
*'''Bhai Bij''', '''Bhau Beej''', or '''Bhav Bij''' ([[Marathi language|Marathi]] : भाऊबीज)  amongst the [[Gujarati language|Gujarati]], [[Marathi language|Marathi]] and [[Konkani]]-speaking communities in the states of [[Gujarat]], [[Maharashtra]], [[Goa]] and [[Karnataka]].
*Another name for the day is ''Yamadwitheya'' or ''Yamadvitiya'', after a legendary meeting between [[Yama (Hinduism)|Yama]] the god of Death and his sister Yamuna (the famous river) on Dwitheya (the second day after new moon).
*Other names include '''Bhatru Dviteeya''', or '''Bhatri Ditya'''.

According to a popular legend in [[Hindu mythology]], after slaying the evil [[demon]] Narkasur, Lord [[Krishna]] visited his sister [[Subhadra]] who gave him a warm welcome with sweets and flowers. She also affectionately applied ''[[tilak]]'' on Krishna's forehead. Some believe this to be the origin of the festival.

==The ceremony==
[[File:Bhaitika krital.jpg|thumb|A boy, wearing the [[Tilaka|''tika'']], made for special occasion of [[Tihar (festival)|tihar]] in Nepal]]
On the day of the festival, sisters invite their brothers for a sumptuous meal often including their favorite dishes/sweets. The whole ceremony signifies the duty of a brother to protect his sister, as well as a sister's blessings for her brother.

Carrying forward the ceremony in traditional style, sisters perform ''[[aarti]]'' for their brother and apply a red ''[[tilaka|tika]]'' on the brother's forehead. This ''tika'' ceremony on the occasion of Bhai Bij signifies the sister's sincerest prayers for the long and happy life of her brother.  In return brothers bless their sisters and treat them also with gifts or cash.

As it is customary in [[Haryana]], [[Maharashtra]] to celebrate the auspicious occasion of Bhau-beej, women who do not have a brother worship the [[lunar deity|moon god]] instead. They apply ''[[mehendi]]'' on girls as their tradition.

The sister, whose brother lives far away from her and cannot come to her house, sends her sincerest prayers for the long and happy life of her brother through the moon god. She performs ''aarti'' for the moon. This is the reason why children of Hindu parents affectionately call the moon ''Chandamama'' (''Chanda'' means moon and ''mama'' means mother's brother).

==The celebration==
[[Bhai Phonta]] in [[West Bengal, India|West Bengal]] is celebrated with much splendor. The ceremony is marked with many rituals along with a grand feast arranged for the brothers.

The festival of Bhai Bij is popular in [[Haryana]], [[Gujarat]], [[Maharashtra]] and [[Goa]] and is celebrated with great fervour and gaiety. Brothers and sisters look forward to the occasion with immense enthusiasm. To add charm to the occasion, Bhai Bij gifts are exchanged between brothers and sisters as a token of love and appreciation.

Bhav Bij is a time for family reunions as all brothers and sisters in the family get together. Close relatives and friends are also invited to celebrate the Bhav Bij in many families.

Special dishes for the festival include the Maharashtra sweet called ''[[basundi]]'' ''[[poori]]'' or ''kheerni poori''.On this occasion sisters give gifts to their brothers.

==Bhaitika in Nepal==
Bhaitika in [[Nepal]] is also known as Bhaitihar meaning ''[[Tihar (festival)|tihar]] of brothers''. On this day, sisters pray to Yamraj for her brother's long life and prosperity.&lt;ref name=diwa&gt;{{cite web|title=Bhai-Tika / Bhai-Teeka|url=http://www.diwalifestival.org/bhai-tika.html|work=diwalifestival.org|publisher=Society for the Confluence of Festivals in India|accessdate=5 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sisters put seven colored long tika on forehead of their brothers.

A '''strap''', sometimes also called '''strop''', is an elongated [[wikt:flap|flap]] or [[ribbon]], usually of [[Cloth|fabric]] or [[leather]].

Thin straps are used as part of [[clothing]] or [[baggage]], or bedding such as a [[sleeping bag]]. See for example [[spaghetti strap]], [[shoulder strap]]. A strap differs from a [[belt (clothing)|belt]] mainly in that a strap is usually integral to the item of clothing; either can be used in combination with [[buckle]]s.

Straps are also used as [[fastener]]s to attach and bind items, to objects, animals (for example a [[saddle]] on a horse) and people (for example a [[watch]] on a [[wrist]]), or even to tie down people and animals, as on an apparatus for [[corporal punishment]]. Occasionally a strap is specified after what it binds or holds, e.g. chin strap.  

Mere two-inch-wide nylon vehicle tow/recovery straps are commonly rated at 20,000 lbs. break strength.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=2 inch nylon strap: Tow Capacity: 10,000 lbs, Break Strength: 20,000 lbs; larger sizes |url=http://www.uscargocontrol.com/Towing-Auto-Hauling/Recovery-Straps-Tow-Straps |publisher=uscargocontrol.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Various tow straps, ropes, etc, with specifications |url=http://www2.northerntool.com/towing/tow-chains-ropes-straps-2.htm |publisher=northerntool.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Webbing]] is a particular type of strap that is a strong fabric woven as a flat strip or tube that is also often used in place of [[rope]]. Modern webbing is typically made from exceptionally high-strength material, and is used in automobile [[seat belts]], furniture manufacturing, transportation, towing, military apparel, cargo fasteners, and many other fields. 

==Packaging==
{{Main|Strapping}}

Strap is commonly used in the [[packaging]] industry to secure or fasten items. It may be made from a wide range of materials, such as [[plastic]], [[steel]], [[paper]], or [[fabric]]. Usually the strap is secured to itself through various means, but it may also be secured to other items, such as [[pallet]]s.

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Garba-dandia02.jpg|thumb|The Dandiya Raas dance]] --&gt;
[[File:Children performing Dandiya in Palace Grounds, Bangalore.jpg|thumb|Dandiya raas dance by children during Navratri in Bangalore]]
'''Raas''' or '''Dandiya Raas''' is the traditional [[folk dance]] form of [[Gujarat]], [[India]], and is associated with scenes of [[Holi]], and [[lila (Hinduism)|lila]] of [[Krishna]] and [[Radha]] at [[Vrindavan]].  Along with [[Garba (dance)|Garba]], it is the featured [[dance]] of [[Navratri]] evenings in [[Western India]]. During [[Navratri]] festival, in most of the cities of [[Gujarat]]  people gather and perform [[Garba (dance)|Garba]] dance - an event that is becoming increasingly popular in countries with large Gujarati-speaking communities around the world, such as Canada, the United States and the United Kingdom. 

==Etymology==
The word &quot;Raas&quot; comes from the [[Sanskrit language|Sanskrit]] word &quot;[[Rasa (aesthetics)|Rasa]]&quot;. The origins of Raas can be traced to ancient times. [[Lord Krishna]] performed [[Rasa lila]]&quot; ([[wikt:Lila|Lila]] means Lord Krishna's playful dance. The word &quot;Laika&quot; also refers to things that God does that we   fully understand).

==Forms of Raas==
[[File:Dandiya Raas.jpg|thumb|The Dandiya Raas dance]]
There are several forms of Raas, but &quot;Dandiya Raas&quot;, performed during [[Navaratri]] in [[Gujarat]] is the most popular form. Other forms of Raas include Dang Lila from [[Rajasthan]] where only one large stick is used, and &quot;[[Rasa lila]]&quot; from [[North India]]. Raas Lila and Dandiya Raas are similar. Some even consider &quot;[[Garba (dance)|Garba]]&quot; as a form of Raas, namely &quot;Raas Garba&quot;.

In Dandiya Raas men and women dance in two circles, with sticks in their hands.

==Origin of Dandiya Raas==
Originating as devotional [[Garba (dance)|Garba]] dances, which were always performed in Durga's honour, this dance form is actually the staging of a mock-fight between the Goddess and [[Mahishasura]], the mighty demon-king, and is nicknamed &quot;The Sword Dance&quot;. During the dance, dancers energetically whirl and move their feet and arms in a complicated, [[choreograph]]ed manner to the tune of the music with various rhythms. The [[dhol]] is used as well as complementary percussion instruments such as the [[dholak]], [[tabla]], [[bongos]] and others.

The sticks (''dandiya''s) of the dance represent the [[sword]]s of Durga. The women wear traditional dresses such as colorful embroidered [[choli]], [[ghagra]] and [[bandhani]] [[dupatta]]s (traditional attire) dazzling with mirror work and heavy jewellery. The men wear special turbans and kedias, but this varies regionally.

Garba is performed before [[Aarti]] (worshipping ritual) as devotional performances in the honor of the Goddess, while Dandiya is performed after it, as a part of merriment. Men and women join in for  Dandiya Raas, and also for the Garba. The circular movements of Dandiya Raas are much more complex than those of Garba. The origin of these dance performances or [[Rasa Lila|Raas]] is [[Krishna]]. Today, Raas is not only an important part of [[Navratri]] in Gujarat, but extends itself to other festivals related to harvest and crops as well. The Mers of Saurastra are noted to perform Raas with extreme energy and vigor.

==History==
The Dandiya Raas dance originated as devotional Garba dances, which were performed in Goddess Durga’s honor. This dance form is actually the staging of a mock-fight between Goddess Durga and Mahishasura, the mighty demon-king. This dance is also nicknamed ‘The Sword Dance’. The sticks of the dance represent the sword of Goddess Durga.

The origin of these dances can be traced back to the life of Lord Krishna.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|url=http://www.riiti.com/2006-09-garba_dandiya-raasdances_and_music_of_navratri.html |title=धर्म, त्योहार और संस्कार &amp;#124; Garba &amp; Dandiya-Raas:Dances and music of Navratri |publisher=RiiTi |date=2006-09-23 |accessdate=2012-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, Raas is not only an important part of Navaratri in Gujarat but extends itself to other festivals related to harvest and crops as well.

[[File:Hostelites enjoying Dandiya.jpg|thumb|Dandia dance]]
Raas is also performed at social functions and on stage. Staged Raas can be very complex with intricate steps and music. Raas is a [[folk art]] and it will change with the times. When African slaves and ship workers (who were [[Muslims]]) arrived on the coast of [[Saurashtra (region)|Saurashtra]], they adopted Raas as their own and used [[African drum]]s. While it originated from Hindu tradition, it was adopted by the Muslim community as Saurashtra. Singing entered the Raas scene later on. Initially, most songs were about Lord Krishna, but songs about love, praise of warriors who fought gallant wars, and the Goddess [[Durga]], and even Muslim Raas songs were born.

The motif is also found represented in trade textiles as early as the 15th century in the prestigious double ikats woven with silk threads (known as patolas) that were traded by Indian (and later European traders) for Southeast Asia's spices. Most originated in Gujarat, the most famous of all of India's patola centres. Because of their rarity and perceived value, we are lucky to have some still in existence today emerging from Indonesian collections.

It is common to think that Raas has to be fast, but that is not the case. Grace and slow movements are just as important. With the advent of C-60 cassettes came the pre-recorded &quot;non stop&quot; Raas music. Soon it overtook the individual Raas items which are rarely recorded nowadays. The [[disco]] beat and use of western drum became popular, but you can still visit fine arts college in [[Vadodara]] during Navaratri where the musicians sit in the centre and play while people dance around them.
[[Gujarati movies]] entered the scene in late 50's and 60's. Raas took on a different form as it borrowed heavily from the film industry.

There are other unique forms of Raas such as one in the town of Mahuva where men would tie one hand to a rope extending from above and hold a stick in the other hand. This was strictly in praise of Goddess [[Durga]]. If you use broader definition, even &quot;[[Manjira]]&quot; can be used to do Raas. There are communities that specialize in Raas with &quot;Manjira&quot;. Just like the [[British police]], some men dancing at &quot;Tarnetar&quot; used to wear colourful bands of cloth around their legs, resembling socks. The city of Mumbai developed its own style of Dandiya Raas. Now, during Navratri people use Dandiya, but make it more like a free style dance. &quot;Head bobbing&quot; during Raas is popular in USA among youngsters, but that arrived from the Gujarati movies. Head bobbing was for the singers, not for the dancers.

==Costumes and music==
The women wear traditional dresses such as colorful embroidered [[choli]], [[ghagra]] and [[bandhani]] dupattas, which is the traditional attire, dazzling with mirror work and heavy jewellery. The men wear special turbans and kedias, but can range from area to area. The dancers whirl and move their feet and arms in a choreographed manner to the tune of the music with a lot of drum beats. The dhol is used as well as complementary percussion instruments such as the dholak, tabla, et cectra. the true dance gets extremely complicated and energetic. Both of these dances are associated with the time of harvest.

==Difference between Dandiya and Garba==
The main difference between Garba and Raas is that Raas is played with Dandiyas (pair of colorfully decorated sticks), while Garba consists of various hand and feet movements. Most of the Dandiya steps require even number of people while in Garba there is no such requirement on number of people. There are many popular Dandiya Songs available in Gujarati and Hindi.&lt;br&gt;
For Dandiya, sometimes instead of sticks, people also use &quot;Swords&quot;. The circular movements of Dandiya Raas are much more complex than that of Garba. As people play with sticks, it is important to be careful while playing Dandiya.

{{Costume}}

A '''costume party''' ([[American English]]) or a '''fancy dress party''' ([[British English]]) or  is a type of [[party]], common mainly in contemporary [[Western culture]], where guests dress up in [[costume]]s. Costumed [[Halloween]] parties are popular in the United States, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand.

[[File:Bee and Terminator fancy dress costumes.jpg|thumb|Guests in costume at a fancy dress party.]]
The origins of fancy dress parties in the United Kingdom can in some respects be traced to [[Masquerade ball|masked balls]] of the 18th century period. In the period to 1850, fancy dress balls were a typical part of the social life of [[music festival]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Pippa Drummond|title=The Provincial Music Festival in England, 1784-1914|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=oklkS-IJyPAC&amp;pg=PA1|accessdate=22 September 2013|year=2011|publisher=Ashgate Publishing, Ltd.|isbn=978-1-4094-3281-4|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Notable amongst early events in the 20th century was the [[Chelsea Arts Club]] ball. Such events were often elaborate affairs and for the most part confined to those with considerable means.{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}}

Amongst the general population, costume parties also occurred with increasing frequency from the late 1940s onward, although for the most part the costumes were simple affairs until the mid-1970s. Prior to 'cheap' costume imports from the Far East (late 1990s),{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}} most costumes were either hired, or home constructed.  Retail purchased costumes is, in respect of the UK, a largely modern phenomenon (late 1990s onward) although 'accessory' items had been available for some time.{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}} Since the increased import rate in late 1990's onwards saw the many materials / products being imported from the Far East with cost savings in labour and bulk orders. This has seen the price of purchased costumes becoming more and more affordable.

Coupled with the modern trend in costume parties, 'retro' fashion as a costume theme (such as a 1970s or 1980s fancy dress) is also popular, the costumes to some extent parodying or pastiching the fashions of earlier decades.  Amongst the most popular parodied costumes are: [[Audrey Hepburn]] (as [[Holly Golightly (character)|Holly Golightly]]), [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] in her classic stage outfits, and more recently [[Lady Gaga]].

Fancy dress parties are popular year round in the United Kingdom. The 1996 novel ''[[Bridget Jones's Diary]]'' features the classic British costume party theme &quot;Tarts and Vicars&quot; at which the women wear sexually provocative (&quot;tart&quot;) costumes, while the men dress as [[Anglicanism|Anglican priests]] (&quot;[[vicar]]s&quot;).  Fancy dress parties have been held by the [[British Royal Family]].  [[Prince William]] celebrated his 21st birthday with an &quot;Out of Africa&quot; theme, [[Princess Beatrice of York|Princess Beatrice]] chose an 1888 themed party for her 18th birthday, and [[Lord Frederick Windsor|Freddie]]  and [[Gabriella Windsor]] celebrated a joint birthday party with a pre-[[French Revolution]] courtly theme.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.guardian.co.uk/g2/story/0,,1822830,00.html| title = You shall go to the ball | publisher = The Guardian | date = 2006-07-18 | last = Freeman | first = Hadley | accessdate = 2006-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Australia==
Australian fancy dress parties typically follows the style of the United States, and Halloween costume parties have been common since the early 1990s, even though Halloween has not historically been a celebrated event in Australia. Typical events for Australians that involve dressing up are the [[Sydney Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras]], the staff Christmas party and [[cricket]] matches.

One of the oldest examples of fancy dress being worn in Australia is on display at the [[Western Australia Museum]]. It was a child's fancy dress costume worn by Miss Rita Lloyd, aged nine, to the ‘Lord Mayor’s Juvenile Fancy Dress Ball’ at Mansion House in [[Perth]] on 8 January 1909.

==United States==
[[File:The Costume Contest Lineup.JPG|thumb|Contestants line up for a &quot;best costume&quot; competition at a Halloween party in the United States.]]
Costume parties are especially popular in the [[United States]] around [[Halloween]], when [[teenager]]s and [[adult]]s who may be considered too old for [[trick-or-treating]] attend a costume party instead. Costume parties are also popular during the [[carnival]] season, such as at [[Mardi Gras]].

Attendees occasionally dress in costume for popular science fiction and fantasy events, movie openings and book releases. Web site [[theonering.net]] held a ''[[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|The Lord of the Rings]]'' dress Oscar party that was attended by [[Peter Jackson]]. ''[[Star Wars]]'' parties were held to celebrate the opening of ''[[Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace]]''. Many bookstores have held ''[[Harry Potter]]'' themed parties to celebrate the releases of the series' later novels, and some movie theaters have had Potter-themed celebrations as the movie adaptations have been released.

Larger scale 'parties' are often related to organised societies or [[Convention (meeting)|conventions]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}}

==Iraq==
It's a tradition to have a costume party at a university graduation.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.niqash.org/en/articles/society/3436/&lt;/ref&gt;

== Cosplay ==
[[Cosplay]] (short for &quot;costume play&quot;) is a type of costume party where attendees dress as fictional characters. Cosplay originated in Japan, where most cosplay is modelled after popular [[anime]] shows and video game characters. Many anime conventions, including the [[New York Anime Festival]], hold cosplay parties.

== Cons ==
Short for &quot;convention,&quot; several well-known &quot;Comic-Cons&quot; are held annually in the United States.  Many if not most attendees wear costumes representing book, movie, anime, or other characters. Costumes are optional, although at some &quot;cons&quot; they are expected.  Several well-known cons include the [[San Diego Comic-Con International]], [[New York Comic-Con]], and Atlanta's [[Dragon Con]].

== Events and themes ==

There are many annual [[Party|events]] that generate the chance to dress up in fancy dress [[costumes]]; [[Christmas]], [[New Year]], birthdays, [[Bachelor party|Hen and Stag parties]], and [[Book Day]], amongst others.

[[Halloween]] is the most popular costume or fancy dress event of the year in western society.  Halloween originated centuries ago, the Celts believed that on 31 October the line between the living and the dead became distorted, condemned souls would come back to wreak havoc for the night. In defense, the Celts would dress up in ghoulish costumes to scare evil spirits away.

Within many [[fancy dress]] events, a theme is usually present, and with fancy dress outfits often from [[Hollywood films]] such as ''[[Star Wars]]'', ''[[Grease (film)|Grease]]'', ''[[James Bond]]'', and ''[[Spider-Man]]''. Themes are also extremely popular with fundraising events, such as the ''Great Gorilla Run'', where 1,000 people dressed as [[gorilla]]s in London in aid for ''Great Gorillas'', a charity that focuses on the [[endangered species]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}

Some costume parties are themed around [[80s fashion]]. The most popular costumes researched for such fancy dress are the [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] Look, [[punk fashion]] and neon-colored clothing. Some of the easiest and cheapest 1980s costumes include ''[[John Rambo|Rambo]]'', [[Samantha Fox]], and [[Tom Cruise]] from ''[[Risky Business]]'' or ''[[Top Gun]]''. Alternate eighties costumes include dresses, prom dresses and denim from the period, including high waisted pants and [[stone wash]] denim.

Fans sometimes attend sporting events in a costume as a sign of support of their favored team. Some sporting events have large numbers of fans attending in fancy dress costume, notably the [[Wellington Sevens|Wellington Rugby Sevens]] where almost every fan who attends wears some sort of costume.

[[Image:Polka dots.svg|right|thumb|Red polka dots on a yellow background]]
'''Polka dot''' is a [[pattern]] consisting of an array of filled, large in size,[[circle]]s. It differentiates itself from the spot pattern, as Polka dots are perfectly even and sized, while spots are irregular in spacing and shape. Early instances were generally equally sized and spaced relatively closely in relation to their diameters. Many modern prints include more randomly spaced, sized and coloured dots.  Polka dots are most commonly seen on [[children's clothing]], [[toy]]s, and [[furniture]], but they appear in a wide array of contexts. The pattern rarely appears in formal contexts, however, and is generally confined to more playful attire such as [[Itsy Bitsy Teenie Weenie Yellow Polka Dot Bikini|bathing suits]] and [[lingerie]]. Occasionally, white-on-black small dots appear on more formal [[clothing]].

Polka dots became common on clothing in the late nineteenth century in the [[United Kingdom]].

==Etymology==
The pattern shares its name with the [[polka|dance form]], making one suspect there is a connection linking the pattern to the dance. However, the name was likely settled upon merely because of the dance's popularity at the time the pattern became fashionable, just as many other products and fashions of the era also adopted the polka name.&lt;ref&gt;Oxford English Dictionary: polka &quot;On account of the popularity of the dance, polka was prefixed as a trade name to articles of all kinds (cf. quot. 1898 in 1); e.g. the polka curtain-band (for looping up curtains), polka-gauze, polka hat; {polka-dot}, a pattern consisting of dots of uniform size and arrangement; also fig., attrib. or as adj., and as v. trans.; hence polka-dotted adj.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of the pattern in elements of the work of [[Sigmar Polke]] has been cited as a possible source of etymology for polka dots, though this theory has issues of chronology.

== Usage ==
[[File:Girl Sitting in Chair (tone).jpg|thumb|right|Girl wearing polkadot dress]]
Traditionally polka dots are used in the clothing of flamenco dancers and performers. [[Frédéric Bazille|Frédéric Bazille's]] 1867 painting ''[https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Fr%C3%A9d%C3%A9ric_Bazille_001.jpg Family Reunion]'' depicts two women in blue polka dot dresses.  In 1962, [[DC Comics]] introduced [[Polka-Dot Man]] with irregularly-sized and differently coloured dots.  In 1965, [[Bob Dylan]] wore a large print green polka dot shirt in the photo on the cover of his single ''Just like tom thumb's blues''.  Musician [[Randy Rhoads]] used a [[Flying V]] guitar with polka dots. Professional wrestler [[Dusty Rhodes (wrestler)|Dusty Rhodes]] was given a black outfit covered in yellow polka dots during his time in the [[World Wrestling Entertainment|WWF]]. This seemed strange at the time but went on to become a successful and memorable gimmick. [[Blues]] guitarist [[Buddy Guy]] regularly plays a signature [[Fender Stratocaster]] painted in black with cream polka dots. Some people associate polka dots with Venezuelan fashion designer [[Carolina Herrera (fashion designer)|Carolina Herrera]], who used polka dots on most of her dresses during the late 80s and early 90s, as well as on the boxes of perfume [[Carolina Herrera (fashion designer)|Carolina Herrera]], [[Herrera For Men]], [[Aquaflore]] and [[Flore]].  In the Tour de France, the leader in the mountains competition wears a distinctive polka dot jersey (French: maillot à pois rouge). Although the King of the Mountains was first recognised in the 1933 Tour de France, the distinctive jersey was not introduced until 1975. Much of the Japanese artist's [[Yayoi Kusama]]'s work features a polka dot motif.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lylynguyen|title=&quot;Queen of Polka dots&quot; holds exhibit in Vietnam|url=http://vxartnews.com/2013/05/queen-of-polka-dots-holds-exhibit-in-vietnam/|publisher=VX Art News|accessdate=13 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Nachmann|first=Ron|title=Of obliteration and polka dots: films on the vividly obsessive art of Yayoi Kusama|url=http://dangerousminds.net/comments/obliteration_polka_dots_films_kusama|publisher=Dangerous Minds|accessdate=13 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unusually, the world's first [[crack pipe]] [[vending machines]] are polka dotted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ferdman|first=Roberto|title=The world’s first crack pipe vending machines are polka-dotted|url=http://qz.com/176434/what-the-worlds-first-crack-pipe-vending-machines-look-like/|publisher=Quartz|accessdate=13 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There were many other &quot;polka&quot; items, some of which include &quot;polka-hats&quot; and &quot;polka-jackets.&quot; Most disappeared with the fad of the actual polka dance. Only the polka dot fabric pattern remained popular, and the name has been left intact over the years.

The polka dot also appears in popular music.  &quot;[[Itsy Bitsy Teenie Weenie Yellow Polka Dot Bikini]]&quot; is a novelty song telling the story of a shy girl in a very revealing bathing suit who stays immersed in the ocean water to hide from view. It was written by Paul Vance and Lee Pockriss and first released in June 1960 by Brian Hyland.  Before that however, &quot;[[Polka Dots and Moonbeams]]&quot; was a popular song with music by Jimmy Van Heusen and lyrics by Johnny Burke, published in 1940. It was Frank Sinatra's first hit recorded with the Tommy Dorsey Orchestra. The song is one of the top 100 most-frequently recorded jazz standards with arrangements by Gil Evans and others and notable recordings by Lester Young, Sarah Vaughn and many others.

[[Image:Joseph Julien bodice.jpg|thumb|Countrywoman's bodice, 19th century (Detail of ''The Hay-Harvest'' by [[Joseph Julien]]).]]
A '''bodice''' ([[American and British English pronunciation differences|American English]] /ˈbɑːdɨs/, [[British English|British]] /ˈbɒdɪs/), historically, is an article of [[clothing]] for women, covering the body from the neck to the waist. In modern usage it typically refers to a specific type of upper garment common in Europe during the 16th to the 18th century, or to the upper portion of a modern [[dress]] to distinguish it from the skirt and sleeves. The term comes from ''pair of bodies'' (because the garment was originally made in two pieces that fastened together, frequently by lacing).{{citation needed|date=January 2012}}

==History==
In historical usage, particularly in [[Victorian fashion|Victorian]] and [[1900s in fashion|early 20th century fashion]], a ''bodice'' (in earlier sources, ''body''){{citation needed|date=January 2012}} indicates the upper part of a dress that was constructed in two parts (i.e., with separate skirt and bodice, such as a [[ballet tutu]]), but of matching or coordinating fabric with the intention of wearing the two parts as a unit. In [[dressmaking]], the term ''waist'' (sometimes given as &quot;dress waist&quot; to distinguish it from a [[Waist (clothing)|shirtwaist]]) was also used. During wear, the parts might be connected by [[Hook-and-eye closure|hooks and eyes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Butterick|title=Dressmaking, Up To Date|publisher=Butterick Publishing Company|location=New York|date=c. 1905|pages=75}}&lt;/ref&gt; This construction was standard for fashionable garments from the 18th century until the late 19th century, and had the advantages of allowing a voluminous skirt to be paired with a close-fitting bodice, and of allowing two or more bodices to be worn with the same skirt (e.g., a high-necked bodice and a low-necked bodice allowed the same skirt to serve for both daywear and evening wear). One-piece construction became more common after 1900 due to the trend for looser, more simply-constructed clothing with  narrower skirts.

In modern usage, ''bodice'' typically refers to an upper garment that has removable [[sleeve]]s or no sleeves, often low-cut, worn in [[Europe]] from the 16th century to the 18th century, either over a [[corset]] or in lieu of one. To achieve a fashionable shape and support the bust, the bodice was frequently stiffened with ''bents'' (a type of [[Phragmites|reed]]), or [[whalebone]]. The bodice was different from the corset of the time because it was intended to be worn over the other garments. In earlier periods, bodices and corsets were laced in spiral fashion, with one continuous lace. In later periods, both were laced like the modern tennis shoe, with eyelets facing one another. This was more convenient for women who had to dress themselves.

One mid 19th century style included the Agnes Sorel bodice, named after 15th century royal mistress [[Agnes Sorel]]. This style was a day wear bodice, with a square cut [[neckline]] that had a high front and back and bishop sleeves.&lt;ref name=&quot;CummingCunnington2010&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author1=Valerie Cumming|author2=Valerie Cumming, C.W. Cunnington, P. E. Cunnington|author3=C. W. Cunnington|author4=P. E. Cunnington|title=The Dictionary of Fashion History|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=glBf_El4Qd4C|accessdate=10 January 2012|date=1 September 2010|publisher=Berg|isbn=978-1-84788-738-2|page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Bodice'' continues in use to refer to the upper portion (minus the sleeves) of a one- or two-piece [[dress]]. The bodice of a dress was called the ''[[Corsage (bodice)|corsage]]'' in the 19th century.

==Today==
[[File:Dirndl.jpg|thumb|A woman wearing a [[dirndl]]]]

Bodices survive into modern times in the traditional or revived [[national dress|folk dress]] of many European countries (see, for example, Austrian [[dirndl]] or the [[Aboyne dress]] worn by [[Scottish highland dance]]rs). They are also commonly seen today at [[Society for Creative Anachronism]] events or a [[Renaissance Fair]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title='Bodacious bodices' at the Renaissance Festival|publisher=Metromix|location=Chicago|year=2009|url=http://chicago.metromix.com/home/photogallery/bodacious-bodices-at-the/997298/content}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Morning dress is now rarely worn as anything other than formal wear, as a form of civic dress e.g. by provincial mayors (as an alternative to [[court dress]]), but more generally only for weddings, some official civic, governmental or royal functions,  '[[season (society)|social season]]' events e.g. races such as [[Royal Ascot]], formal lunches (especially those in the City of London institutions notably of the [[livery companies]] and [[guilds]]) and as uniform at some of Britain's most traditional schools such as [[Eton College|Eton]].

==History==

{{Unreferenced section|date=September 2010}}

The name originated from the practice of gentlemen in the nineteenth century riding a horse in the morning with a cutaway front single breasted [[morning coat]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asuitthatfits.com/offthecuff/custom-wedding-suit-styles/ |title=Wedding Suits - A Suit That Fits}}&lt;/ref&gt; The modern twentieth century morning dress was originally a more casual form of half dress, but as the nineteenth century progressed it gradually became acceptable to wear it in more formal situations instead of a [[frock coat]].  In the Edwardian era it took over in popularity from the frock coat as the standard daytime form of men's full dress. When it was regarded as a more casual coat, it was common to see it made with step collars (notched [[lapel]]s in American English), but as it took over from the frock coat in formality it began to be made with the more formal pointed [[lapel]]s (peaked [[lapel]]s in American English).

==Standard components==

===Outline===
Morning dress consists of:
*a [[morning coat]] (the morning cut of tailcoat), now always single breasted with link closure (as on some dinner jackets or one button (or very rarely two) and with pointed [[lapel]]s, may include silk piping on the edges of the coat and lapels (and cuffs on older models with turnup coat sleeves)
*a [[waistcoat]], at formal events this is black and matches the material of the coat; at funerals mourners and undertakers usually are dressed as such and this has led to confusion as termed [[mourning dress]] and also, but rarely, with additional white slips.
*a pair of [[spongebag trousers|formal striped or checked trousers]] worn with [[Suspenders|brace]]s
*a [[dress shirt|shirt]];
**either a turndown collar is worn (white [[detachable collar|detachable]], fastened by [[collar stud]]s; or attached) with a [[necktie|tie]], in which case the shirt has [[French cuff|double cuffs]]
**otherwise, a high detachable wing collar is worn with a single-cuffed shirt; this combination is always accompanied now by a formal [[Ascot tie|Ascot]], as opposed to a ''day cravat'' which is different. This is a more formal option most commonly seen at weddings;
*a plain or patterned silk [[handkerchief]] or pocket square may be worn; it is folded and inserted into the front breast pocket of the morning coat
*black [[Oxford shoe]]s or [[dress boot]]s, or boots with a horse riding connection, such as George or Chelsea boot, or [[galosh]]-top dress boots; worn with plain dark socks (or another colour if they cannot be seen)

If the trouser cloth matches the coat, the ensemble becomes a morning suit. The waistcoat may also match, or not (an &quot;odd waistcoat&quot;). Morning suits will sometimes be a middle-tone gray. Morning suits, especially the lighter-toned ones, are considered slightly less formal than morning coat ensembles.

The following can optionally be worn or carried with morning dress:
* a [[top hat]], either classic silk plush, or a modern Melusine fur (replacement for silk plush, as it is no longer in mainstream manufacture). Alternatively, a top hat made of fur felt or wool felt, is another common option.
* [[gloves]] of [[suede]], [[chamois]], or [[kidskin|kid]] leather; the most traditional colour is lemon or grey
* grey or white [[Spat (footwear)|spats]]
* a cane or umbrella
* a [[pocket watch]] on the waistcoat rather than at the lapel, or [[wrist watch]]
* a [[boutonnière]]

===Full description===
[[File:Reagan hirohito.jpg|thumb|left|[[Nancy Reagan|Nancy]] and [[Ronald Reagan]], [[Emperor Hirohito]], 1983]]
The morning coat can be black or Oxford grey [[herringbone (cloth)|herringbone]] [[wool]] with the tails of knee length. The [[spongebag trousers|formal ('spongebag') trousers]] worn with it are either 'cashmere' striped, or black and white checked.

The most traditional colours for a waistcoat are grey, buff (a yellowish tan colour), or black. A black morning coat with matching black waistcoat is the most formal option, being worn for [[funeral]]s, memorial services, civic dress and diplomatic dress (replacing or supplementing [[Court Dress]]), with [[academic dress]], or in government use in America. At social or festive occasions, e.g. races and weddings, a contrasting waistcoat is worn, usually dove grey or sometimes [[Buff (color)|buff]], although there has been a tendency towards 'fancy' waistcoats of multicoloured and embroidered materials. Waistcoats may be either single-breasted or double-breasted with lapels. Sometimes a white slip is worn, which is a strip of fabric buttoned to the inside top of the waistcoat to simulate the effect of a paler under-waistcoat, though the actual wearing of two waistcoats was obsolete even for the late Victorians.

Formal trousers should not have turn-ups (''cuffs'' in American English), and should have one or two forward pleats to each leg. Braces (''suspenders'' in American English) should be worn to prevent the waistband from appearing beneath the waistcoat.

A white stiff collar is traditional, with the plain turn-down cutaway variety standard since the World War II; in this case a normal long tie is worn. Otherwise, a wing collar may be worn; the combination of long tie and wing collar is very dated, so these are paired with an Ascot, though even this has acquired negative connotations as dress hire companies used pre-tied or incorrect patterns for many years which has caused the configuration to be seen as an inferior or hired look. Because of this [[Debrett's]], for example, considers the Ascot and wing collar inappropriate for weddings or morning dress. If the shirt has turn-down collars it usually has sleeves with double cuffs fastened with [[cufflinks]] as standard. If a wing collar is worn it should be with a single cuff shirt as in the past a starched stiff fronted shirt was worn with the cuffs also starched stiff as well as a starched detachable wing collar, worn with cufflinks and shirt studs (essentially, the same as the full evening dress shirt). Contemporary shirts often do not have a detachable collar at all. The most formal colour for a shirt is white, but if a coloured or striped shirt is worn, it should have contrasting white collar (and possibly cuffs). Traditional formal colourings are Wedgwood blue, solid or in thin vertical stripes.

Previously, a grey or (if at a funeral) a black neck-tie was obligatory. Now all colours are worn; in many clubs and societies the Club Tie is acceptable to distinguish members from guests at formal lunches and breakfasts. The original silver Macclesfield design (a small check) is still used particularly with cravats, and is often called a ''wedding tie''.

Shoes should be of the traditional, black plain cap-toe [[Oxford shoe|Oxford]] type without [[brogues|brogueing]], but not [[patent leather]] which is now reserved for evening [[formal wear]]. In the Victorian and Edwardian era [[button boot]]s and [[Oxford boot]]s were worn and these can be correctly worn with morning dress today.  When worn at equestrian events, boots of equestrian origin such as [[jodhpur boot]]s, [[George boot]]s and [[Chelsea boot]]s are also acceptable. [[Spat (footwear)|Spat]]s were once frequently seen with morning dress, but are now rarely worn.

===Morning Grey===

Slightly less formal, a morning suit can be worn, which has mid-grey matching morning coat, waistcoat, and trousers (all cut the same as above); being more relaxed, this is a traditional option for events in less formal settings such as [[Royal Ascot]], and is now often worn to weddings as well.

===Scottish Highland dress===

{{details|Scottish apparel}}

[[Scottish Highlands|Scottish Highland]] dress may also be worn at events requiring morning dress:

The morning suit version of Highland dress consists of:
* Tweed or Black (or charcoal) semi-formal kilt jacket in superfine wool or barathea; Argyll-, Crail-, and Braemar-style jackets are suitable
* Five- or six-button waistcoat in matching colour, grey, putty, or [[tartan]]
* [[Kilt]]
* White shirt with turndown collar, French cuffs, and cufflinks
* Tie in a single colour or striped regimental style
* Black brogues (NOTE: some view brown shoes should NEVER be worn with highland dress, although such are worn by the royals) 
* Tartan, argyle, diced, or plain-coloured dark hose (white and off-white hose should NEVER be worn)
* Flashes or garter ties
* Dress [[Sporran]]
* Dress [[Sgian dubh]]

==Occasions==
[[Image:1929wedding.jpg|thumb|upright|Men in morning dress for a wedding (1929)]]

Men wear morning dress when members of a wedding party. In common with [[court dress]], [[mess dress]], and [[white tie]], morning dress is for prestigious and important social occasions. Despite its name, morning dress may be worn to afternoon social events before five o'clock, but not to events beginning after seven o'clock in the evening; the term &quot;morning&quot; is best understood as &quot;daylight&quot;.

[[White tie]] is the correct, equivalent formal dress for evening social events. The cutaway front of the morning tail coat differs from the evening tail coat (dress coat) in that the waist of former is cut obliquely while the waist of the latter is cut horizontally, and the tail is cut differently from the swallow tailcoat used for evening dress. The skirt waist construction of the coats is equestrian in origin, to ease the wearer's riding his horse. In the U.S., the [[morning coat]] is sometimes referred to as a ''cutaway'' coat.

In Britain, morning dress is worn to certain equestrian events (such as [[Royal Ascot]] and [[The Derby]]).  It is also worn, both in British Commonwealth countries such as Australia and New Zealand, by the male members of a wedding party. Men at Upper and Middle class weddings usually wear their own morning coats and their own ties. On these occasions they may wear their old school ties. It is currently popular in the British Working class (constituting the majority of the population) for only the 'wedding party' to wear morning 'suits'. These tend to be hired and far more 'co-ordinated' than those worn by their upper-middle and upper-class counterparts. The men usually dress in identical, hired, outfits along with identical ties, handkerchiefs and waistcoats.

In Europe, the groom sets the sartorial tone: the guests may wear morning dress if he does.

[[File:Blazer.JPG|300px|thumb|A single-breasted, reefer-style, navy blue blazer dressed with brass buttons.]]
A '''blazer''' is a type of [[jacket]] resembling a [[suit (clothes)|suit]] jacket, but cut more casually. A blazer is generally distinguished from a [[sportcoat]] as a more formal garment and tailored from solid color fabrics. Blazers often have naval-style metal buttons to reflect their origins as jackets worn by boating club members.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.esquire.com/style/tips/blazer-vs-coat-vs-jacket-0709 &quot;How to Buy a Blazer,&quot; ''The Esquire How-to Style Guide'', esquire.com, July 2009, accessed 23 June 2012]&lt;/ref&gt;

A blazer's cloth is usually durable, as it is intended as outdoor wear. Blazers are often part of a [[uniform]] that denotes, for example, an airline's employees, students of a particular school, members of sports clubs, and athletes on a particular team.

==Wearing a blazer==
Blazers are worn with a wide variety of other clothes, ranging from a [[dress shirt]] and [[necktie]] to an open-necked polo shirt, even to just a plain tee shirt. They are seen with trousers of all colors and [[textile|fabrics]], from the classic white cotton or [[linen]], to grey [[flannel]], to brown or beige [[chino cloth|chinos]], and also [[jeans]].

A fitted, classically cut, double-breasted navy blue blazer with navy-style buttons is a popular design and sometimes referred to as a &quot;reefer&quot; blazer. Particularly in North America and the United Kingdom, it is now frequently used in [[business casual]] attire.

[[File:Cambridge-half-blue-blazer.jpg|thumb|right|A [[Cambridge University]] Rifle Association [[blue (university sport)|half-blue]] blazer]]
Blazers are worn as part of [[school uniform]]s by many schools across the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]], and in a wide range of colors is still daily wear for most uniformed pupils in Britain, Australia and New Zealand. These are blazers in the traditional sense, single-breasted often of bright colors or with [[Piping_(sewing)|piping]]. This style is also worn by some boat clubs, such as those in [[Cambridge University|Cambridge]] or [[Oxford University|Oxford]], with the piped version only on special occasions such as a boat club dinner. In this case, the piping is in [[Oxbridge scarf colours|college colours]], and college buttons are worn. This traditional style can be seen in many films set in the Edwardian era, such as ''[[Kind Hearts and Coronets]]''.

Where the blazer is part of the dress of a school, college, sports club, or armed service veterans' association, it is normal for a badge to be sewn to the breast pocket. In schools, this may vary according to the student's standing in the school; whether a member of the junior or senior school, being a [[prefect]] or having been awarded colors, in recognition of particular achievement in some academic or sporting field. In the Commonwealth, many regimental associations (veterans' organizations) wear 'regimental blazers' which also sport a similar badge on the breast pocket, usually in the form of a wire badge, and sometimes also regimental blazer buttons. In the British army officers do not normally wear badges on their blazers (or boating jackets). Any two regimental blazers will very rarely be the same, as they are made up from different civilian sources and are not issued by any authority. This has come to be representative of the fact that the members of the association are now civilians, but retain the bond that the badge represents. The standard color is navy blue, although in some associations different colors are worn, such as [[rifle green]] for the associations of rifle regiments.

Blazers, once commonly worn playing or attending traditional 'gentlemen's sports', persist in only some games now, such as occasional use by tennis players, or cricket, where in professional matches, such as international test matches, it is considered customary for the captain to wear a blazer with the team's logo or national coat of arms on the breast pocket, at least during the coin toss at the beginning of the match.

Two sporting events where blazers signify victory are the Congressional Cup Regatta at the Long Beach Yacht Club, and the Masters golf tournament, held in Augusta, Georgia. The former event awards a crimson blazer to the winner of several flights of match race sailing of the highest international caliber, while the latter awards a green blazer to the top masters golfer in the USA.

==History==
The sartorial term ''blazer'' originated with the red 'blazers' of the [[Lady Margaret Boat Club]] (1825), the rowing club of [[St. John's College, Cambridge]]. The Lady Margaret club jackets were termed ''blazers'' because of the bright red cloth; the term survived the original red coat. A writer to the London ''[[The Daily News (UK)|Daily News]]'' (22 August 1889) commented that &quot;In your article of to-day‥you speak of ‘a striped red and black blazer’, ‘the blazer’, also of ‘the pale toned’ ones.‥ A blazer is the red flannel boating jacket worn by the Lady Margaret, St. John's College, Cambridge, Boat Club. When I was at Cambridge it meant that and nothing else. It seems from your article that a blazer now means a colored flannel jacket, whether for cricket, tennis, boating, or seaside wear.&quot;

[[File:Dress and blazer.jpg|thumb|200px|Woman wearing a teal blazer.]]
These early blazers were like later sports jackets, but this term has never referred to blazers, instead describing jackets derived from the later innovation of wearing odd jackets for land-based sports. Assertions that the name is derived from HMS ''Blazer'' are not borne out by contemporary sources, although it is reported that before the [[Royal Navy uniform#Ratings|standardization of uniform in the Royal Navy]], the crew of HMS ''Blazer'' wore &quot;striped blue and white jackets&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;[http://wayback.archive.org/web/20060304101909/http://www.royal-navy.mod.uk/server/show/nav.3772 The History of Rating Uniforms : Uniforms and Badges of Rank : RN Life : Training and People : Royal Navy&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; apparently in response to the sailors of [[HMS Harlequin|HMS ''Harlequin'']] being turned out in [[harlequin]] suits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Regan|first=Geoffrey|title=The Guinness Book of Naval Blunders|publisher=Guinness|isbn=0-85112-713-4|page=90}}&lt;/ref&gt; As late as 1845 the gig's crew of HMS ''Blazer'' were dressed by their Captain in jackets of blue and white stripes and it is from this that the word &quot;Blazer&quot;, meaning a striped jacket, has entered the language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Talbot-Booth |first=E.C. |year=1940 |title=All the World's Fighting Fleets |edition=4th |publisher=[[Sampson Low]], Marston &amp; Co. Ltd |location=London |page=}}{{page needed|date=August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{vague|date=September 2015}}

The reefer jacket was of naval origin, and described the short double breasted jacket worn by sailors in harsh weather, when they perform duties such as [[reefing]] the sails. It is descendants of this which are now commonly described by the term ''blazer''. Originally with black horn buttons, these jackets evolved to the modern dark blazer, now single as well as double breasted, and with metallic buttons.

Striped blazers became popular among British [[Mod (subculture)|Mods]] in the early 1960s, and again during the [[Mod revival]] of the late 1970s — particularly in three-color thick/thin stripe combinations, with three-button single breasted front, five or six inch side or center vents and sleeve-cuffs with multi-buttons. Various photos from 1964 and 1965 show London mods in boating blazers. Photos of mod icons [[The Who]] from 1964 (as the [[High Numbers]]) variously show [[Pete Townshend]], [[Keith Moon]] and [[John Entwistle]] wearing boating blazers. Another mod band, [[Small Faces]], and other bands liked by mods — such as [[The Rolling Stones]], [[The Beatles]], [[The Kinks]], [[Georgie Fame and the Blue Flames]], [[The Animals]], [[The Yardbirds]], The [[Moody Blues]] and [[The Troggs]] — had band members wearing striped blazers/boating jackets or later, brightly colored blazers with wide white or other light edging. Buttons on these later blazers often became non-metal, sometimes in the same color as the edging. The earlier style of striped blazers can be seen in the film ''[[Quadrophenia (film)|Quadrophenia]]''. The later bright style of blazer was affectionately adopted by [[Austin Powers (character)|Austin Powers]] as part of his [[Swinging London]] look. {{Citation needed|date=June 2008}} By the late 2000s the blazer had been adopted as a popular fashion trend amongst females, often having shorter lengths, rolled up sleeves, various lapels, and bright colors.

==History==
Prior to its usage as a term for a pre wedding party  &quot;hen party&quot; was used in the United States as a general term for an all female gathering usually held at a hostesses residence. In 1897 [[The Deseret News]] noted that &quot;hen party&quot; was a &quot;time honored idea that tea and chitchats, gossip smart hats, constitute the necessary adjuncts to these particular gatherings&quot;. In 1940 [[Eleanor Roosevelt]] was described as hosting a Christmas time &quot;hen&quot; party for cabinet wives and &quot;ladies of the press&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://life.time.com/popular-culture/teenagers-a-1944-photo-essay-on-a-new-american-phenomenon/?iid=lf%7Cmostpop#23 The Invention of Teenagers: LIFE and the Triumph of Youth Culture]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=fjtPAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=W00DAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4017,4940452&amp;dq=hen-party&amp;hl=en Gridiron Visited by Santa AP Reprinted by St. Petersburg Times December 15, 1940]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=9iEhAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=tWQEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6361,456699&amp;dq=hen-party&amp;hl=en And Too, How Much Should Wives tell husbands?

Although the practice of giving a party to honour the bride-to-be goes back for centuries, in its modern form, the bachelorette party may have begun during the [[sexual revolution]] of the 1960s. It was uncommon until at least the mid-1980s, and the first book on planning bachelorette parties wasn't published until 1998.&lt;ref name=&quot;isbn0-8135-3811-4&quot;&gt;{{cite book

Bachelorette parties were especially popular around the turn of the 21st century and frequently appeared in the news. &lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.co.za/books?id=53_K9J2F5zoC&amp;pg=PA40&amp;lpg=PA40&amp;dq=bachelorette+party+1990s+early+2000s&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=uXqDyqq7lC&amp;sig=m2Lpf8wkW_YP1F64o6TOyIzIjPE&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Sd1QVYCqKYqu7gbHrYDICg&amp;ved=0CB0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=bachelorette%20party%201990s%20early%202000s&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.chicparties.co.uk/blog/history-of-the-hen-party/15.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

==Entertainment==
[[File:Naked butlers with a hen party, Bristol 2013.jpg|320px|thumbnail|right|Topless butlers serving guests at a hen party]]
Many different kinds of entertainment are selected, depending on what the organizers think will best please their guest of honor. While notions of a bachelorette party as a night of drunken debauchery persist in some social circles, it is becoming widely seen in America as an opportunity for [[female bonding]].&lt;ref name=&quot;isbn0-8118-4458-7&quot;&gt;{{cite book

When held in a private venue, such as the hostess's home, the party may take any form that pleases the hostesses and honors the bride-to-be. Dinners and [[cocktail parties]], which provide comfortable opportunities for participants to talk or to give intimate advice to the bride-to-be, are common.&lt;ref name=&quot;isbn0-06-074504-5&quot;/&gt; Other hostesses choose a themed party, such as a &quot;[[pamper party]],&quot; with guests indulging in [[spa]] treatments, or a cooking class.&lt;ref name=&quot;isbn0-446-67822-8&quot;&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; While proposing a [[toast (honor)|toast]] to the bride-to-be is common at most bachelorette parties, some center on [[drinking games]].

Many companies sell products aimed at the organizers of bachelorette parties, including packs of [http://www.highkickevents.com/hen-party-dares/ hen party dares], pre-printed invitations, decorations, novelties, and [[sex toy]]s. In North America, it is common to hire a [[male stripper]] and/or attend a male strip club.

In the UK, a [[naked butler]] has become a common theme and a popular hen party idea. The [[naked butler]] is often dressed in just a collar, dickie bow, cuffs and a short apron or trunks. He will wait on the hen and her party including serving drinks and food as well as hosting or taking part in hen party games and entertainment. An extension of this concept that has also become popular in the UK is the hiring of a naked chef to cater for the guests often accompanied by a naked butler to serve the food and drinks.

==Organization==
Participants are often all women. [[Bridesmaids]] (if any) are typically invited, but any of the [[bride]]'s close friends may be included.&lt;ref name=&quot;isbn0-06-074504-5&quot;/&gt;

This party is typically hosted by one or more members of the [[wedding party]], although it is possible for any friend to host a party in honor of the bride-to-be. Formally, a party in honor of the bride-to-be is never hosted by the bride-to-be,&lt;ref name=&quot;urlDon’t Be Rude: Part III, Socializing by Margaret Berry - The Morning News&quot;&gt;{{cite news

While it is normally the duty of a hostess to pay for the entertainment she gives her guests, it is common in most English-speaking countries for participants to share the costs of this event.&lt;ref name=&quot;isbn0-06-074504-5&quot;/&gt; Whether the bride-to-be pays her share, or whether her share is divided between other participants is something to be determined by the organizers and the bride-to-be during the early stages of the planning process.

Since it is derived from a formal dinner, a bachelorette party is properly held in the evening,&lt;ref name=&quot;1922 Post&quot;/&gt; usually about a week (or at least a few days) before the wedding,&lt;ref name=&quot;isbn0-06-074504-5&quot;/&gt; and usually includes dinner, although alternative approaches are not uncommon.&lt;ref name=&quot;isbn0-06-074504-5&quot;/&gt;

==Alternatives==
A more traditional alternative is the ''bridesmaids luncheon'', hosted by friends of the bride's mother or mothers of the bridesmaids, usually give the day before the wedding.  Attendees include the bridesmaids, their mothers and close female friends and relatives; the event is often multi-generational including mothers and even grandmothers of the bride and groom. At a bridesmaids luncheon, the bride often presents a small gift to each bridesmaid. The purpose of the luncheon is for the bride to thank her attendants and includes presenting them with bridesmaid gifts.  It is also when the bridesmaids' gift is customarily given to the bride.  If there is a cake, it frequently contains good luck charms. 

If a significant aspect of the party is presenting small gifts to the bride-to-be, then the event is properly called a [[bridal shower]]. For the convenience of the bride-to-be, bridal showers are usually held earlier than a bachelorette party.&lt;ref name=&quot;isbn0-385-41342-4&quot;&gt;{{cite book

A [[stag and doe]] party, also called a &quot;Jack and Jill&quot;, &quot;buck and doe&quot; or &quot;hag&quot; (''hen'' + ''stag'') party, is a similar party that includes men and women. It may combine aspects of a [[drinking game]] with [[fundraising]].

A '''tracksuit''' is an article of [[clothing]] consisting of two parts: [[trousers]] and a [[jacket]] usually with front [[zipper]]. It was originally intended for use in [[sport]]s, mainly as what [[Athletics (track and field)|athlete]]s wore over competition clothing (such as running [[shirt]] and [[shorts]] or a [[swimsuit]]) and would take off before competition. In modern times, it has become commonly worn in other contexts. The tracksuit was one of the earliest uses of synthetic fibers in sportswear.&lt;ref name=&quot;uniexposed&quot;&gt;{{cite book |author=Craik, Jennifer |title=Uniforms Exposed (Dress, Body, Culture) |publisher= Berg Publishers |location=Oxford, UK |year=2005 |page=171 |isbn=1-85973-804-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A descendant of the tracksuit, the '''shell suit''', which arrived in the late 1980s, was popular with the hip hop and breakdancing scene of the era.&lt;ref name=&quot;I Love Shell Suits&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iloveshellsuits.com/history.htm |title=History of The Shellsuit |publisher=Iloveshellsuits.com |date= |accessdate=2012-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;
They were manufactured from a mix of [[cellulose triacetate]] and [[polyester]] making them shiny on the outside, with distinctive combinations of colours.&lt;ref name=&quot;shellsuit&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fashion-era.com/fitness_fashion_after_1960.htm |title=Fitness Fashion History after 1960 |accessdate=2013-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most tracksuits have a mesh interior which allows the user to wear them without any undergarment such as underwear. This is much like a bathing suit. Many people wear it for [[physical exercise]] sessions. A [[sauna suit]] is a specialized form of tracksuit made of a waterproof fabric such as coated nylon or PVC that is designed to make the wearer sweat profusely.  Sauna suits are primarily used for temporary weight loss.

==Fashion history==
[[Image:2008 Summer Olympics Australian Parade in Sydney - Women's softball team.jpg|thumb|The Australian Olympics women's softball team at a welcome-home parade in Sydney. 2008.]]
Tracksuits have come in and out of fashion over several decades. The first decade to feature tracksuits as sportswear that was acceptable to wear outside of the gym was the 1970s. Most likely the trend was influenced by the emergence of Bruce Lee (Game of Death) as a popular movie celebrity. Tracksuits first became popular around 1975, made out of cotton, polyester, terry cloth, or a mix. In the late 1970s velour became popular, so much so that it became the most used form of fabric on a tracksuit. The trend of wearing athletic clothing continued into the early 1980s. Tracksuits were eventually replaced by shellsuits, which were made out of nylon, in the late 1980s. This trend was short-lived, lasting only a few years.

In the late 1990s, tracksuits made a comeback in mainstream fashion for both men and women. They returned to the fabrics of the 1970s, most notably polyester. The return of tracksuits can largely be credited to music, most notably Rapper [[Jay Z]] and fellow Spice Girl [[Sporty Spice]]. The trend continued into the 2000s, where velour made a comeback, by the likes of [[Juicy Couture]] and other brands. This continued for most of the decade. Tracksuits went out of fashion in the late 2000s, and have not been popular as street-wear since.

The tracksuit is also known as a '''warm-up suit''', or '''&quot;warmups&quot;''' for short, as they are intended for athletes to keep their bodies warm before or after competition, and during breaks, especially important in cold weather. In almost all cases, sports teams will wear these garments using a fabric that matches their official team, school, or country colors.

Since 2006, prominent fashion designers have been asked to design tracksuits for the athletes of various [[Olympic games|Olympic]] teams, usually all the athletes representing one country. For example, designer [[Ralph Lauren]] created the USA uniforms for the 2010 [[Winter Olympic Games]] opening ceremony.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/alltherage/2012/07/olympics-2012-ralph-lauren-reveals-us-olympic-team-opening-ceremony-outfits.html |title=Olympics 2012: Ralph Lauren reveals U.S. team opening ceremony outfits |publisher=Latimesblogs.latimes.com |date=2012-07-10 |accessdate=2014-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The sportswear company [[Adidas]] hired Stella McCartney to be the Creative Director for the 2012 GB Olympic Games (by Adidas)—the first time in the history of the games that a leading fashion designer has designed the apparel for a particular country’s team across all competitions for both the Olympic and the Paralympic Games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Zoe Beaty |url=http://www.graziadaily.co.uk/fashion/archive/2012/03/22/stella-mccartney-s-winning-olympic-kit-for-team-great-britain--first-look.htm |title=Stella McCartney Unveils 2012 Olympics Kit! &amp;#124; Grazia Fashion |publisher=Graziadaily.co.uk |date=2012-03-22 |accessdate=2014-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Association with organized crime==
The tracksuit has also historically been linked to organized [[mafia|crime syndicate]]s in many parts of the world including the [[United States]] and [[Western Europe|Western]] and [[Eastern Europe]]. This has often been glamorized on television programs such as ''[[The Sopranos]]'', ''[[It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia]]'', and ''[[Brotherhood (2006 TV series)|Brotherhood]]'', as well as movies including ''[[Goodfellas]]'', ''[[The Departed]]'', and ''[[Donnie Brasco (film)|Donnie Brasco]]''.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[File:Chino pants.jpg|thumb|170px|alt=Chino pants|A pair of trousers made from chino cloth, generally referred to as chinos]]
'''Chino cloth''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|t|ʃ|iː|n|əʊ}} {{respell|CHEE|noh}}) is a [[twill]] fabric, originally made of 100% [[cotton]]. The most common items made from it, [[trousers]], are widely called ''chinos''. Today it is also found in cotton-synthetic blends.

Developed in the mid-19th century for British and French military uniforms, it has since migrated into civilian wear. Trousers of such a fabric gained popularity in the U.S. when [[Spanish–American War]] veterans returned from the [[Philippines]] with their twill military trousers.

==Etymology==
The etymology of the term ''chino'' is disputed. Some sources identify the root as the [[Spanish language in the Americas|American Spanish]] language word ''chino'', which translated literally means [[toast]]ed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=chino |title=Online Etymology Dictionary |publisher=Etymonline.com |date= |accessdate=2012-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Because the cloth itself was originally manufactured in [[China]], the name of the trousers may have come from the country of origin.&lt;ref name=duchamplondon1&gt;{{cite web|title=The History Of The Chino|url=http://www.duchamplondon.com/marcs_blog/the-history-of-the-chino/|publisher=Duchamp London|accessdate=21 December 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131012043922/http://www.duchamplondon.com/marcs_blog/the-history-of-the-chino/|archivedate=12 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
First designed to be used in the military and then taken up by civilians, chino fabric was originally made to be simple, hard-wearing and comfortable for soldiers to wear; the use of natural earth-tone colors also began the move towards camouflage, instead of the brightly colored [[tunic]]s used prior. The British and then American armies started wearing it as standard during the latter half of the 1800s.&lt;ref name=&quot;duchamplondon1&quot; /&gt;

The pure-cotton fabric is widely used for trousers, referred to as chinos. The original [[khaki]] (light brown) is the traditional and most popular color, but chinos are made in many shades.&lt;ref name=&quot;duchamplondon1&quot; /&gt;

A '''hoodie''' (also called a '''hooded sweatshirt''' or '''hoody''') is a [[sweatshirt]] with a [[Hood (headgear)|hood]]. They often include a [[Muff (handwarmer)|muff]] sewn onto the lower front, a hood, and (usually) a [[drawstring]] to adjust the hood opening.

The hoodie took off in the [[1970s in fashion|1970s]], with several factors contributing to its success. [[Hip hop culture]] developed in [[New York City]] around this time, and the hoodie's element of instant anonymity, provided by the accessible hood, appealed to those with criminal intent.&lt;ref name=&quot;nyt&quot; /&gt; High fashion also contributed during this era, as Norma Kamali and other high-profile designers embraced and glamorized the new clothing&lt;ref name=&quot;yusuf&quot; /&gt; Most critical to the hoodie's popularity during this time was its iconic appearance in the blockbuster ''[[Rocky]]'' film.{{Citation needed|date=August 2012}}

===Australia===
In June 2011,  police in [[Wynnum, Queensland|Wynnum]], [[Brisbane]], launched a &quot;Hoodie Free Zone&quot; initiative, with shopkeepers encouraged to ask hoodie-wearers to leave. The zone is part of an initiative to educate businesses on how they can avoid armed robberies, in which the clothing is often worn.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.news.com.au/breaking-news/hood-free-zones-in-brisbane-west/story-e6frfku0-1226083718148|title=Hood-free zones in Brisbane west|agency=AAP|date=28 June 2011|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5zmEqCc8i|archivedate=28 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Canada===
{{unreferenced section|date=December 2014}}
Across Canada, hoodies are a popular clothing item—they are sometimes worn under a coat or jacket to provide an extra layer of clothing during the winter. In the province of [[Saskatchewan]], hoodies are often referred to as &quot;bunny-hugs.&quot;

===New Zealand===
The &quot;Hoodies on Parliament - politicians challenge youth stereotypes&quot; campaign was launched in May 2008 in [[New Zealand]] (NZ) as part of the annual national Youth Week event, a pro-youth initiative organized to challenge youth stereotypes. To launch the campaign, NZ politicians, including National MP Nicky Wagner, Green Party MPs Sue Bradford, Nandor Tanczos and Metiria Turei, and Maori party MP Hone Harawira, wore hoodies while standing on the steps of the country's parliament. Archbishop David Moxon, Archbishop of the Anglican Dioceses, and Brian Turner President of the Methodist Church of NZ also participated in the campaign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Hoodies on Parliament challenging youth stereotype|url=http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/CU0805/S00305.htm|accessdate=7 December 2014|work=Scoop|date=29 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Support and criticism were raised by politicians, who were divided over the 2008 event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Politicians support Hoodie Day|url=http://tvnz.co.nz/content/1806287/2591754.xhtml|website=TVNZ|publisher=TVNZ.co.nz|accessdate=7 December 2014|date=30 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;NZ_Herald_10512586&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/section/1/story.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=10512586 |title=Youth Week Hoodie Day criticised |author=Tait, Maggie |date=26 May 2008 |agency=[[NZPA]] |newspaper=[[The New Zealand Herald]] |accessdate=3 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; One strong response was drawn from a local government council member, Dale Evans, who donned a [[Ku Klux Klan]] outfit in protest, citing the hoodie as &quot;not an appropriate article of clothing to celebrate.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;NZ_Herald_10513425&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/section/1/story.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=10513425 |title=Councillor stuns board with Ku Klux Klan outfit |date=30 May 2008 |work=[[The New Zealand Herald]] |accessdate=3 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&quot;Goodie in a Hoodie&quot; day was then run in 2009 by New Zealand Adolescent Health and Development (NZAAHD) in partnership with Age Concern—the organisations used the campaign to highlight the stereotypes that both young people and the elderly face in New Zealand. Liz Baxendine, president of Age Concern at the time, said to the media:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Older people and young people have a lot in common. We both face stereotypes based on our age rather than our real achievements and outlook on life ... we've got to destigmatise the hoodie and see it for what it is. Everyone wears them. We need to take the hoodie back!&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1=Kathryn King|title=Oldies but hoodies|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/wanganui-chronicle/news/article.cfm?c_id=1503426&amp;objectid=10985317|accessdate=7 December 2014|work=Wanganui Chronicle|date=12 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===United Kingdom===
[[File:No hoodies sign.jpg|thumb|left|&quot;No hoodies&quot; sign outside a pub in South London]]
In the [[United Kingdom|UK]], hoodies have been the subject of much criticism; some shoplifters have used the hood to conceal their identities from [[Closed-circuit television|CCTV]] cameras in shopping centres.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/g2/story/0,3604,1482816,00.html | work=The Guardian | location=London | title=In the hood | first=Gareth | last=McLean | date=2005-05-13 | accessdate=2010-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The hoodie became a popular clothing item by the 1990s. During the 21st century, it had gained a negative image, being associated with trouble making teens and [[Anti-social behavior|anti-social behaviour]]. It became one of the later items associated with &quot;[[chav]]s&quot;, or [[Neds]].

Angela McRobbie, professor of communications at [[Goldsmiths College]] in the UK, says the appeal of the hoodie is because of its promise of anonymity, mystery and anxiety. &quot;The point of origin is obviously black American [[hip-hop]] culture, now thoroughly mainstream and a key part of the global economy. Leisure and sportswear adopted for everyday wear suggests a distance from the world of office [[suit (clothing)|suit]] or [[school uniform]]. Rap culture celebrates defiance, as it narrates the experience of [[social exclusion]]. Musically and stylistically, it projects menace and danger as well as anger and rage. The hooded top is one in a long line of garments chosen by young people, usually boys, to which are ascribed meanings suggesting that they are 'up to no good'. In the past, such appropriation was usually restricted to membership of specific youth cultures - leather jackets, [[bondage trousers]] - but nowadays it is the norm among young people to flag up their music and cultural preferences in this way, hence the adoption of the hoodie by boys across the boundaries of age, ethnicity and class.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;guardian 2005&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/g2/story/0,3604,1482816,00.html|title=In the hood|publisher=The Guardian|date=2005-05-13 | location=London | first=Gareth | last=McLean | accessdate=2010-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2005, [[Bluewater (shopping centre)|Bluewater]] shopping centre in [[Kent]] caused outrage by launching a code of conduct which bans its shoppers from sporting hoodies or [[baseball cap]]s, although the garments remain on sale. [[John Prescott]] welcomed the move, stating that he had felt threatened by the presence of hooded teenagers at a motorway service station.&lt;ref name=&quot;guardian 2005&quot; /&gt; Then-[[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] [[Tony Blair]] openly supported this stance and vowed to clamp down on the [[anti-social behavior|anti-social behaviour]] with which hoodie wearers are sometimes associated. London-based rapper [[Lady Sovereign]] published a single titled &quot;[[Hoodie (Lady Sovereign song)|Hoodie]]&quot; in protest as part of a &quot;Save the Hoodie&quot; campaign.&lt;ref&gt;Dan Hancox: [http://www.newstatesman.com/200510310009 Observations on style]. [[New Statesman]], 31 October 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, [[Coombeshead College]] in the south-west of England allowed the hoodie to become part of the boys' [[school uniform]], but the hood could be put up only when it rained. The principal, Richard Haigh, stated that the move would help to calm some of what he called the &quot;hysteria&quot; surrounding the garment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/devon/4562737.stm|title=School adopts 'hoodie' as uniform|publisher=BBC|date=2005-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[JCB Academy]] allows hoodies, but only a [[navy blue]] type sold in the school shop.

In February 2006, a 58-year-old teacher who was wearing a hooded top was asked to remove it when entering a [[Tesco]] store in [[Swindon]]. According to the teacher, she was wearing the hood because &quot;my hair's a mess&quot;. The store did not have a hoodie policy. The shop apologized and said it was taking action to &quot;make sure this doesn't happen again.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/wiltshire/4735154.stm|title=Shop regrets 'hoodie' humiliation|publisher=BBC|date=2006-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2006, [[David Cameron]], leader of the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]], made a speech suggesting that the hoodie was worn more for defensive than offensive purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/5166498.stm|title=Cameron 'hoodie' speech in full|publisher=BBC|date=2006-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The speech was referred to as &quot;hug a hoodie&quot; by the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/5163798.stm|title=Cameron defends 'hoodie' speech

Despite the controversy, the hoodie has been embraced by people from all backgrounds.  [[Zara Phillips]], a member of the British royal family, has included hoodies in her range of equestrian clothing at [[Musto (company)|Musto]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rideaway.co.uk/zara-phillips/ Zara Phillips, Musto clothing]&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent years in England many older people have been seen wearing hoodies, particularly in cold weather.

===United States===
Throughout the U.S., it is common for middle school, high school, and college students to wear sweatshirts—with or without hoods—that display their respective school names or mascots across the chest, either as part of a uniform or personal preference.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}} Hoodies have become mainstream fashion in the U.S., transcending the clothing item's original utilitarian purpose,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/01/28/hoodies-hailed-as-definin_n_440535.html Hoodies Hailed As Defining Fashion Trend] ''[[The Huffington Post]]'' (28 January 2010). Retrieved on 12-28-10.&lt;/ref&gt; similar to [[jeans]]. This has found its way into a variety of styles, even so far as to be worn under a suit jacket.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}

The hooded sweatshirt is a utilitarian garment that originated in the 1930s for workers in cold [[New York]] warehouses,&lt;ref name=TampaTribune20120324&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tbo.com/news/hoodie-becomes-symbol-of-injustice-384502 |title=Hoodie becomes symbol of injustice |last=Koehn |first=Donna |date=24 March 2012 |website=The Tampa Tribune |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6IL7PaBeG |archivedate=23 July 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Hoodies were later adopted by [[hip hop]] culture as a symbol of what one reporter termed &quot;cool anonymity and vague menace;&quot; when the garment was depicted in FBI composite drawings of Unabomber [[Ted Kaczynski]], the hoodie became linked to &quot;seedy threatening criminality,&quot; thereby further asserting its non-mainstream symbolism.&lt;ref name=TampaTribune20120324/&gt;

====Controversy====

After the February 2012 [[shooting of Trayvon Martin]], who was wearing a hoodie at the time of his death, the garment took on a wider significance—it was highlighted as a symbol of injustice&lt;ref name=TampaTribune20120324/&gt;—and &quot;million hoodie marches&quot; were staged in solidarity.&lt;ref name=CSMonitor20130706&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Justice/2013/0706/George-Zimmerman-prosecution-leaves-jury-to-untangle-lies-and-justification |title=George Zimmerman prosecution leaves jury to untangle lies and justification |last=Jonsson |first=Patrik |date=6 July 2013 |website=The Christian Science Monitor |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6IKSSFcqK |archivedate=23 July 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, some professional athletes, including [[Carmelo Anthony]] and the entire [[Miami Heat]] roster, tweeted photos of themselves wearing hoodies.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}} [[Fox News Channel]] host [[Geraldo Rivera]] encouraged young people of color to stop wearing hoodies;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Yyqkcc-a8U Geraldo Rivera: 'Leave the Hoodie At Home'] [[Fox News Channel]] via [[Talking Points Memo]] (23 March 2012)&lt;/ref&gt; however, he later apologized for his comments.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0312/74529.html Geraldo Rivera apologizes for 'hoodie' comment] ''[[Politico]]'' (27 March 2012).

Don Barrington proposed SB 13 in December 2014 to criminalize wearing a &quot;robe, mask or other disguise&quot; in public that would &quot;intentionally conceal the wearer's identity.&quot; Barrington has been criticized but said the word &quot;hoodie&quot; is not included in his proposal, other than a reference to &quot;hoods.&quot;

Ethno-legal historian Fernin F. Eaton suggested in an academic paper delivered in 2014, entitled &quot;Hume, Hobbes and the Hood(ies)&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://independent.academia.edu/FerninEaton|title=Fernin Eaton - Academia.edu|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; that the choice of certain forms of dress, when viewed as conveying a political statement, has origins in Afro-Creole protest tradition in the United States, reflecting cultural and associational values of the participants. Eaton links those choices to Enlightenment writers and the later De Tocqueville who remarked that Americans' tendency to form &quot;associations&quot; is a hallmark of its culture. The early women's protest statement wearing the [[tignon]] headpiece in Spanish colonial Louisiana in the 18th century would be an example of protest against [[sumptuary law]].

==History==
In the [[1960s in fashion|1960s]] and [[1970s in fashion|1970s]], at the same time as Western fashion was appropriating elements of Indian dress, Indian fashion also absorbed elements of Western dress.&lt;ref name=craik38&gt;{{cite book|last1=Craik|first1=Jennifer|title=The Face of Fashion: Cultural Studies in Fashion|date=2003|publisher=Routledge|isbn=1134940564|page=38|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=9lmIAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA38}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=geczy&gt;{{cite book |last1=Geczy |first1=Adam |title=Fashion and orientalism : dress, textiles and culture from the 17th to the 21st century |date=2013 |publisher=Bloomsbury |location=London |isbn=9781847885999 |page=185 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=vVVMAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA185 |chapter=Postwar Revivalism and Transorientalism}}&lt;/ref&gt; This practice of mutual appropriation continued throughout the 1980s and 1990s, as multiculturalism in fashion design took hold, with Western designers incorporating traditional Indian crafts, textiles and techniques at the same time as Indian designers allowed the West to influence their work.&lt;ref name=craik38/&gt; While middle-class Indian women in migrant communities originally tended to favour Western styles for all occasions in the 1960s and 1970s, they gradually began to wear stylish Indian dress for special occasions as a status symbol equivalent to chic Western fashion.&lt;ref name=lakha&gt;{{cite book |last1=Lakha |first1=Salim |editor1-last=Pinches |editor1-first=Michael |title=Culture and Privilege in Capitalist Asia |date=2005 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=9781134642151 |pages=252-277 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=V6CEAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA263|chapter=The state globalisation and Indian middleclass identity}}&lt;/ref&gt; One example of a traditionally Indian garment that has been heavily influenced by Western fashion is the [[kurta]] suit, a reversal of the established tradition of Western fashion being influenced by Asian design.&lt;ref name=geczy/&gt; Geczy noted that, ironically, an Indian woman wearing traditional clothing might find herself said to be &quot;imitating&quot; Western fashion, and that the boundaries between East and West in fashion were becoming increasingly blurred.&lt;ref name=geczy/&gt;

==21st century==
By the first decade of the 21st century, Western styles were well established as part of Indian fashion, with some professional Indian women favouring Western-style dresses over saris for office wear.&lt;ref name=lakha/&gt; Fashionable Indian women might take the traditional [[shalwar kameez]] and wear the [[kameez]] (tunic) with [[jeans]], or the pants with a Western blouse.&lt;ref name=lakha/&gt;

Among the youth, there appears to be an enthusiastic approach to combining traditional clothes with a western touch.&lt;ref name=shetty&gt;Bollywood Vogue July 8, 2014  [http://www.bollywoodvogue.com/shilpa-shetty-indo-fusion-look/ Indo-Fusion Look and Bollywood Prapti Bagga Arora]&lt;/ref&gt; With increasing exposure of the [[Indian subcontinent]] to the [[Western world]], the merging of women's clothing styles was inevitable. Many Indian and Pakistani women residing in the West still prefer to wear traditional [[salwar kameez]] and [[sari|sarees]]; however, some women, particularly those of the younger generation, choose Indo-Western clothing.

The clothing of the quintessential Indo-Western ensemble is the trouser suit, which is a short [[kurta]] with straight pants and a [[dupatta]]. Newer designs often feature sleeveless tops, short dupattas, and pants with slits. New fusion fashions are emerging rapidly, as designers compete to produce designs in tune with current trends.

Additional examples of the fusion that Indo-Western clothing represents include wearing jeans with a [[choli]], salwar or kurta, adding a dupatta to a Western-style outfit, and wearing a lehnga (long [[skirt]]) with a tank top or halter top.

==Distinctive elements in Indo-Western fashions==
[[File:Indo-western-clothing.jpg|thumb|upright|A woman wearing an Indo-Western outfit]]
*'''Sleeve length''' -  The traditional salwar has long or short sleeves. An Indo-Western design might forego sleeves altogether, or replace the sleeves with spaghetti straps, resembling the style of a [[Tank top (shirt)|tank top]] or [[halterneck|halter]]. There are also poncho-styled tops and one-sleeve designs that follow contemporary Western trends.
*'''Shirt length''' - Indo-Western kurtas and salwars tend to be much shorter than those traditionally worn, so that they resemble Western-style blouses.
*'''Necklines''' - Some Indo-Western tops are available with plunging necklines, in contrast to the traditional styling of salwars and kurtas.

==Well known wearers of Indo-Western fashion==
One person who is a well known enthusiast of the hybrid fashion is Indian actress [[Shilpa Shetty]].&lt;ref name=shetty/&gt;

'''Dupatta''' ({{lang-hi|दुपट्टा}}, {{lang-pa|ਦੁਪੱਟਾ/ਚੁੰਨੀ, {{Nastaliq|دوپٹا}}}}, {{lang-ur|{{Nastaliq|دوپٹا}}}})  (alternative names include '''chādar-orni/orna''' ({{lang-bn|ওড়না}}), '''chunri''', '''chunni''' and '''pacheri''') is a long, multi-purpose [[scarf]] that is essential to many [[South Asia]]n women's suits and matches the woman's garments. The dupatta is most commonly used with [[shalwar kameez]] and the [[kurta]], but is also worn over the [[choli]] or [[gharara]]. The dupatta has long been a symbol of modesty in South Asian dress.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mark Magnier&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url= http://articles.latimes.com/2010/feb/23/world/la-fg-pakistan-scarf24-2010feb24|title=For Pakistani women, dupattas are more than a fashion statement |publisher = Los Angeles Times |author= Mark Magnier|date= 23 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History and origin ==
{{see also|Ghoonghat}}
The word dupatta is a combination of 'du-' meaning two, and 'patta' meaning strip of cloth, originally from Sanskrit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.ahdictionary.com/word/search.html?q=dupatta|title= American Heritage Dictionary Entry: dupatta|author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= 2014|website= www.ahdictionary.com|publisher= Houghton Mifflin Harcourt Publishing Company|access-date= 2015-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Early evidence of dupatta veil or scarf can be traced to the [[Indus valley civilization]], where the sculpture of the Priest King whose left shoulder is covered with some kind of a chaddar, suggests that the use of the dupatta dates back to this early [[History of south asia|Indic culture]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Dupatta: a statement of style |url=http://www.dawn.com/weekly/review/archive/070802/review1.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Early [[Sanskrit]] literature has a wide vocabulary of terms for the veils and scarfs used by women during ancient period, such as ''Avagunthana'' meaning cloak-veil, ''Uttariya'' meaning shoulder-veil, ''Mukha-pata'' meaning face-veil, ''Sirovas-tra'' meaning head-veil.&lt;ref&gt;Govind Sadashiv Ghurye (1951) &quot;Indian Costume.&quot;, p.236&lt;/ref&gt; Dupatta veil is believed to have evolved from ancient ''Uttariya'' veil, worn by women in ancient period as part of three-piece attire.&lt;ref&gt;Simmi Jain (2003) &quot;Encyclopaedia of Indian Women Through the Ages: The middle ages.&quot;, p.200&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Anupa Pande(2002) &quot;The Buddhist Cave Paintings Of Bagh&quot;, p.49&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Prachya Pratibha(1978) &quot;Prachya Pratibha, Volume 6&quot;, p.121&lt;/ref&gt;

Dupatta is worn in many regional styles across [[South Asia]]. Originally, it was worn as a symbol of modesty. While that symbolism still continues, many today wear it as just a decorative accessory. There is no single way of wearing the dupatta, and as time evolves and fashion modernizes, the style of the dupatta has also evolved.

A dupatta is traditionally worn across both shoulders and around head. However, the dupatta can be worn like a cape around the entire torso. The material for the dupatta varies according to the suit.{{citation needed|date=October 2011}} There are various modes of wearing dupatta. When not draped over the head in the traditional style, it is usually worn with the middle portion of the dupatta resting on the chest like a garland with the ends thrown over each shoulder. When the dupatta is worn with the salwar-kameez it is casually allowed to flow down the front and back.{{citation needed|date=October 2011}} In current fashions, the dupatta is frequently draped over one shoulder and even over just the arms. Another recent trend is the short dupatta, which is more a scarf or a stole, often worn with [[kurtas]] and Indo-Western clothing. Essentially, the dupatta is often treated as an accessory in current urban fashion.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mark Magnier&quot;/&gt;

When entering a [[mosque]], [[dargah]], [[church (building)|church]], [[gurdwara]] or [[mandir]], it is the habit in the [[Indian subcontinent]] for women to cover their head with a dupatta.&lt;ref name=&quot;GoldmanHain2006&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last1=Goldman|first1=Ann|last2=Hain|first2=Richard|last3=Liben|first3=Ann Goldman Richard Hain Stephen|title=Ox Textbook Palliat Care Child Oxt:ncs C|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=f1fTsoA4wDMC&amp;pg=PA224|accessdate=13 November 2012|year=2006|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780198526537|page=224}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Hinduism}}
'''Chhath'''  ([[Devanagari]]: '''छठ''', '''छठी''', '''छठ पर्व''', '''छठ पुजा''', '''डाला छठ''', '''डाला पुजा''', '''सूर्य षष्ठी''') is an ancient [[Hinduism|Hindu]] [[Vedic]] [[List of Hindu festivals|festival]] dedicated to the Hindu [[Sun]] God, [[Surya]] and [[Chhathi Maiya]] (ancient Vedic Goddess ; [[Ushas|Usha]] - wife of Sun God ).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hinduism.about.com/od/festivalsholidays/fl/Chhath-Puja.htm|title=Chhath Puja|publisher=About Religion|author=Subhamoy Das|accessdate=November 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aryabhatt.com/fast_fair_festival/Festivals/Chhath%20Festival.htm Festivals of India And Nepal - CHHATH FESTIVAL&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The Chhath [[Puja (Hinduism)|Puja]] is performed in order to thank Surya for sustaining life on earth and to request the granting of certain wishes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Destinations :: Patna|url=http://bstdc.bih.nic.in/Patna.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; This festival is observed by [[Nepalese people]] and [[Indian people]] along with their diaspora.

The [[Sun]], considered as the god of energy and of the life-force, is worshiped during the Chhath festival to promote well-being, prosperity and progress. In Hinduism, Sun worship is believed to help cure a variety of diseases, including [[leprosy]], and helps ensure the longevity and prosperity of family members, friends, and elders.

The rituals of the festival are rigorous and are observed over a period of four days. They include holy bathing, fasting and abstaining from drinking water ([[Vratta]]), standing in water for long periods of time, and offering [[prashad]] (prayer offerings) and [[arghya]] to the setting and rising sun.
  
Although the festival is observed most elaborately in  in [[Mithila, Nepal|Mithila Region of Nepal]], [[Madhesh|Terai-Madhesh of Nepal]], Indian states of  [[Bihar]], [[Jharkhand]] and eastern [[Uttar Pradesh|UP]],  it is also more prevalent in areas where migrants from those areas have a presence. It is celebrated in all Northern regions and major Northern urban centers in India bordering [[Nepal]]. The festival is celebrated in the regions including but not exclusive to the [[Northeast India|northeast region of India]], [[Madhya Pradesh]], [[Uttar Pradesh]], [[Chhattisgarh]], [[Chandigarh]], [[Gujarat]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://jaibihar.com/surat-1-lakh-to-celebrate-chhath-puja/13529/ |title=Surat 1 lakh to celebrate chhath puja |work=Jai Bihar |date=22 October 2009 |accessdate=2009-12-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/20100103174842/http://jaibihar.com/surat-1-lakh-to-celebrate-chhath-puja/13529/ |archivedate=3 January 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://jaibihar.com/15-lakh-to-observe-chhath-puja-in-delhi/13535/ |title=15 lakh to observe Chhath Puja in Delhi |work=Jai Bihar |date=22 October 2009 |accessdate=2009-12-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/20091102225314/http://jaibihar.com:80/15-lakh-to-observe-chhath-puja-in-delhi/13535/ |archivedate=2 November 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bangalore]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dnaindia.com/mumbai/report_juhu-beach-decks-up-for-worshipping-the-sun-god_1302371|title=Juhu Beach decks up for worshiping the sun god|work=DNA India|date=24 October 2009|accessdate=2009-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mauritius]], [[Fiji]], [[Trinidad]] and [[Tobago]], [[Guyana]], [[Suriname]] and [[Jamaica]].

==Date of the festival==

'''Chhath puja''' is performed on ''Kartika Shukla Shashthi'', which is the sixth day of the month of [[Kartika (month)|Kartika]] in the [[Vikram Samvat]]. This falls typically in the month of October or November in the Gregorian English Calendar. The exact date of the festival is decided by Central division of [[Janakpurdham]] in [[Mithila, Nepal|Mithila Region of Nepal]] which is applicable to Worldwide adherents.

It is also celebrated in the summer (March–April), on [[Chaitra]] Shashthi, some days after [[Holi]]; this event is called ''Chaiti Chhath''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://jaibihar.com/chaiti-chhath-to-start-today/5784 |title=Chaiti Chhath to start today |work=Jai Bihar |date=30 March 2009 |accessdate=2009-12-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/20100104000540/http://jaibihar.com/chaiti-chhath-to-start-today/5784/ |archivedate=4 January 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The former is more popular because winter is the usual festive season in [[Nepal]] and also in [[Bihar]] of North India.  Chhath, being an arduous observance, requiring the worshipers to fast without water for around 36 hours continuously, is easier to undertake in the Indian winters but little harder in Nepalese Winter for '''Nepali Maithils''' due to cold climate in Terai and Mithila region of Nepal.
      
===Etymology===
The word ''chhath'' means ''sixth'' in [[Nepali language|Nepali]], [[Maithili language|Maithili]], [[Bhojpuri]], [[Hindi]]  and local dialects and the festival is celebrated on the sixth day of the month [[Kārtika]] of the Hindu lunar [[Nepali calendar]]. The word is a [[Prakrit]] derivation from the Sanskrit ''ṣaṣṭhi'', meaning ''sixth''.It is the longest and most important festival after navratri. The very first day of chhath starts exactly 4 days from Diwali and last for 4 more days. This day the people who observe fast  take bath at a river or pond and prepare lunch (consisting of rice,dal mixed with pumpkin and pumpkin, made in pure ghee). The second day (5th day from Diwali) is known as kharna or kheer- roti. In which the kheer( A Indian recipe where rice is prepared with sweetened milk instead of water) and chapati ( called roti in many Indian provinces). The people observe fast for the full day without taking even water and eat this kheer-roti as dinner after offering it to the rising moon and Goddess Ganga. This is the only time when they eat or drink anything from the starting of the day till the last day of chhath. 
The third day is the main festival day(exactly 6th day from Diwali)of chhath is observed by offering surya namashkar and fruits to the setting sun followed by the next day (exactly 7th day from Diwali) event of offering surya namashkar and fruits to the rising sun on the fourth or last day of chhath.

==History==
It is believed that the ritual of Chhath puja may even predate the ancient [[Vedas]] texts, as the [[Rigveda]] contains hymns worshiping the Sun god and describes similar rituals. The rituals also find reference in the [[Sanskrit]] [[Indian epic poetry|epic]] poem ''[[Mahābhārata]]'' in which [[Draupadi]] is depicted as observing similar rites.

In the poem, Draupadi and the [[Pandavas]], rulers of [[Indraprastha]] (modern Delhi), performed the Chhath ritual on the advice of noble sage [[Dhaumya]]. Through her worship of the Sun God, Draupadi was not only able to solve her immediate problems, but also helped the Pandavas later regain their lost kingdom.

Its yogic/scientific history dates back to the Vedic times. The [[rishis]] of yore used this method to remain without any external intake of food as they were able to obtain energy directly from the sun's rays. This was done through the Chhath method.&lt;ref&gt;''Sri Chhath Mahaviggyaan'' (The Science of Chhath) by Yogishri Oumkaar&lt;/ref&gt;

Another history behind celebrating the Chhath puja is the story of Lord [[Rama]]. It is considered that Lord Rama of India and [[Sita]] of [[Nepal]] had kept fast and offer puja to the Lord Sun in the month of [[Kartika (month)|Kartika]] in Shukla Paksh during their coronation after returning to the Ayodhya after 14 years of exile. From that time, chhath puja became the significant and traditional festival in the Hindu religion and started celebrating every year at the same date in [[Sita]]'s homeland [[Janakpur]] and adjoining Indian states of [[Bihar]] but has not been popular in [[Rama]]'s kingdom of [[Ayodhya]].

==Chhathi Maiya==
The Goddess who is worshipped during the famous Chhath Puja is known as [[Chhathi Maiya]]. Chhathi Maiya is known as [[Ushas|Usha]] in the Vedas. She is believed to be the beloved younger wife of Surya, the sun god. Usha and Pratyusha are wives of Surya and Aditi is his mother.

Usha is the term used to refer to dawn– The first light of day. But in the Rig Veda she has more symbolic meaning. Symbolically Usha is the dawn of divine consciousness in the individual aspirant.
It is said - ''Usha'' and ''Pratyusha'', wives of Sun are the main source of Sun. Both ''Usha'' and ''Pratyusha'' are worshiped along with Sun in chhath parva. ''Usha'' (literally-the first morning sun-ray) is worshipped on the last day and ''Pratyusha''(the last sun-ray of day) is worshipped in the evening by offering water or milk to the rising and setting sun respectively. 
This is the only parva which signifies rising sun as well as setting sun both

==Rituals and traditions==
Chhath is a festival of bathing and worshipping,that follows a period of abstinence and segregation of the worshiper from the main household for four days. During this period, the worshiper observes purity, and sleeps on the floor on a single blanket.This is the only holy festival which has no involvement of any [[pandit]] (priest).The devotees offer their prayers to the setting sun, and then the rising sun in celebrating its glory as the cycle of birth starts with death. It is seen as the most glorious form of Sun worship.

===Nahay khay/Arwa Arwain===
On the first day of Chhath Puja, the devotees take a dip, preferably in the river [[Kosi river]], [[Karnali River|Karnali]] and [[Ganga]] and carry home the holy water of these historical rivers to prepare the offerings. The house and surroundings are scrupulously cleaned. The ladies observing the Vrata called vratin allow themselves only one meal on this day.

===Lohanda and Kharna===
On the second day of Chhath Puja, the day before Chhath, the Vratins observe a fast for the whole day, which ends in the evening a little after sunset. Just after the worship of Sun and moon, the offerings of Kheer (rice delicacy), puris (deep-fried puffs of wheat flour) and bananas, are distributed among family and friends. The Vratins go on a fast without water for 36 hours after 2nd day evening prashad (kheer)..

===Sandhya Arghya (evening offerings) OR Pahela Aragh===
This day is spent preparing the prasad (offerings)at home. On the eve of this day, the entire household accompanies the Vratins to a riverbank, pond or a common large water body to make the offerings (Arghya) to the setting sun. It is during this phase of Chhath Puja that the devotees offer prayers to the just setting sun. The occasion is almost a carnival. Besides the Vratins, there are friends and family, and numerous participants and onlookers, all willing to help and receive the blessings of the worshipper. The folk songs sung on the evening of Chhath.

===Usha Arghya (morning offerings) OR Dusra Aragh===
On the final day of Chhath Puja, the devotees, along with family and friends, go to the riverbank before sunrise, in order to make the offerings (Arghya) to the rising sun. The festival ends with the breaking of the fast by the Vratins. Friends, Relatives visit the houses of the devotees to receive the prashad.

The main worshipers, called ''Parvaitin'' (from Sanskrit ''parv'', meaning 'occasion' or 'festival'), are usually women. However, a large number of men also observe this festival. The parvaitin pray for the well-being of their family, and for the prosperity of their offsprings. Once a family starts performing Chhatt Puja, it is their duty to perform it every year and to pass it on to the following generations. The festival is skipped only if there happens to be a death in the family that year.

The prasad offerings include sweets, [[Kheer]], [[Thekua]] and fruit offered in small bamboo soop [[winnow]]s. The food is strictly vegetarian and it is cooked without salt, onions or garlic. Emphasis is put on maintaining the purity of the food.&lt;ref name=toi_thekua&gt;{{cite news|title='Rasiao-kheer', 'thekua' make for festive platter|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2011-11-01/ludhiana/30345212_1_chhath-puja-ancient-hindu-festival-sun-god|accessdate=13 March 2012|newspaper=[[The Times of India]]|date=1 Nov 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Regional Differences of Rituals &amp; Traditions ==
There are few differences in rituals and traditions which have been observed between devotees performing Chhath Puja in Northern parts of [[Bihar]] and those of South [[Bihar]]. The north and south [[Bihar]] are divided by the river [[Ganges]] and so is the distinction between regions. Some traditions of the Puja  are quite strict in North [[Bihar]] whereas it is more liberal in South [[Bihar]]. In general, it is the tradition that [[Thekua]] which is the [[Prasad]] (''Offering'' to the God) should be strictly prepared on ''&quot;mitti chulha&quot;'' (traditional ''earthen stove'') by using clean ''&quot;wood sticks&quot;'' as the fuel. This is religiously followed in North [[Bihar]] whereas devotees in South [[Bihar]] sometimes prepare the ''offering'' on Gas Stove depending on their comfort. Another difference which is observed is the ''&quot;number of consecutive years&quot;'' the puja is performed by a main worshiper. In northern side of [[Bihar]], the tradition is that if a person becomes the main worshiper, he/she must continue this for 5 years plus 1 year where the additional 1 year is as ''sood ([[Interest]])''. However, in South [[Bihar]], this rule is quite flexible and there is no minimum limit on the ''&quot;number of consecutive years&quot;'' for which the puja should be performed by a specific main worshiper. A person can even become the main worshiper for only 1 year.

A '''procession''' (French ''procession'' via Middle English, derived from Latin, ''processio'', from ''procedere'', to go forth, advance, proceed) is an organized body of people walking in a formal or ceremonial manner.

[[Image:Funeral Procession - 15th Century - Project Gutenberg eText 16531.jpg|thumb|A funeral procession, illustrated in a manuscript of the ''Hours of the Virgin''. Fifteenth century. [[British Museum]], Add. MS. 27697.]]

==Procession elements==
[[File:TÜRKA XIX üldlaulupeo rongkäigus 01.JPG|thumb|Preparations for [[Estonian Song Festival]] procession by [[University of Tartu Folk Art Ensemble]]. Over 42 000 persons participated in that procession in 2014.]]
Many elements may be used to make a procession more significant than just &quot;people walking in the same direction&quot;:

* A special '''mode of transport''', such as a ceremonial [[barge]], elephant [[howdah]], horse-drawn [[carriage]], or a [[Litter (vehicle)|palanquin]] carried on the shoulders of others. [[Cleopatra]]'s arrival to seduce [[Mark Antony]] on a perfumed barge has taken on legendary proportion. African kings sometimes ride in palanquins carved to look like luxury cars or other [[status symbol]]s, while Muslim brides travel in camel howdahs as shown in ''Bride Arriving in a Village, Biskra, [[Algeria]]'' by [[Philippe Pavy]]. The [[Pope]] has traditionally been carried in a special [[sedan chair]] known as the [[sedia gestatoria]]. In humbler terms, a [[mayor]], [[grand marshal]], or fair &quot;queen&quot; of a local parade will often ride in the town's fanciest [[automobile]].
* '''Music''', including everything from the [[choir]] of a church procession to the [[marching band]] of a military procession. Criers may march before the procession, yelling to clear the way for it. Some high school [[homecoming]] parades include trucks filled with people who do nothing but make as much noise as possible.
* '''Order of precedence''': even without showy display, a group of people walking forward may be said to form a procession if their order and placement clearly visualize a hierarchy or symbiotic relationship. For instance, one's nearness to the king or others of high rank had important political connotations when the royal family walked to or from chapel services at the [[palace of Versailles]]. Similarly, precedence came into play when the grandest [[Edwardian]] parties progressed from the sitting room to the dining room, and the stylized movement and hierarchy of marching military units clearly sets up a formal procession.
* '''Bearers''' of [[banner]]s, fans, [[icon]]s, treasure, or other eye-catching items, or leading exotic animals. This was a very important part of [[Roman triumph]]s, as booty gave the Roman populace visual proof of the warrior's success. The most elaborate evolution of this is the spectacular [[Float (parade)|float]]s of [[Carnival]] [[parade]]s. A simpler example is the [[ring bearer]] at a wedding.
* '''Scent''', provided by flower bearers or censers of [[incense]].
* '''Skilled performers''', such as acrobats or dancers
* Special '''costume''': traditionally, the costumes of [[acolyte]]s, [[footmen]], [[ceremonial guards]], or slaves help show off the wealth of the person staging a procession. An ornate example was the embroidered [[train]] of [[George IV of the United Kingdom]], carried at his coronation by nine lords in waiting with their own matching silken clothes, capes, ruffs, and plumed hats. Other examples include the [[Swiss Guard]] and high vestments of the Pope. The formal, matching clothes of bridesmaids and groomsmen are in the same tradition, although sometimes purchased at the attendant's expense rather than by the people honored in the ceremony. In egalitarian times and places, whoever has taken the time and money to put together something impressive may appear in a parade; such costumes are of course the focal point of [[Halloween]] parades such as that staged in [[Greenwich Village]], New York. Finally, processions may be staged simply to show off the costumes as one part of a larger event, such as at fashion pageants, military reenactments, pop concerts, or Renaissance Festivals.
* Special '''lighting''': [[candlelight vigil]]s for the deceased or to show political solidarity often include a candlelit procession. [[Fireworks]] illuminate such diverse events as coronations, parades, and Thai royal barge processions.
* '''Spectacle''', such as an aircraft [[flypast|flyover]], or the confetti of New York [[ticker tape parade]]s
* '''The dispensing of gifts''', at one time often food or money. Today, most people are familiar with the dispensing of beads at [[Mardi Gras]] and the throwing of candy at local fair parades.

==Functions of processions==

===Advertisement===
[[File:060611 Mons (20).JPG|thumb|The Petit Doudou actors in the procession of the Golden Car in [[Mons]] ([[Belgium]])|180px]]
[[Edo Period]] documenters enjoyed drawing the processions of [[Red light districts|pleasure district]] beauties, such as ''Courtesan Parading With Attendants'' by [[Suzuki Harunobu]]. Similar parading courtesans feature in ''Cherry Blossom in the Evening on the Nakanomachi in Yoshiwara'' by [[Utagawa Hiroshige]] and ''True Scenery of the Gay Quarter of Minatozakimachi Shinminato'' by [[Utagawa Sadahide]]. The [[Lord Mayor's Show]] in [[London]] has long featured displays by the city's official trade guilds. Parades were at one time important advertisement when a traveling [[circus]] arrived in a new town. Today, many parades in the United States are sponsored by department stores, such as [[Macy's]], which expect the public spectacle to lure shoppers to the store.

===Change in government===
The ''Reception of the Ambassadors From Siam at the [[Château de Fontainebleau]]'' was one such example, documented by [[Jean-Léon Gérôme]] in 1864. The signing of surrender by Japanese diplomats and soldiers aboard an American [[battle ship]] at the end of [[World War II]] involved a strictly codified procession on and off the ship.[[File:14th Century Medieval Chariot.jpg|thumb|Royal procession, design from the 14th century.|110px]] Processions play an important role in coronations, such as that of [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom]] in 1953, the [[Shah]] of [[Iran]] in 1967, [[Otumfuo Osei Tutu II]] of the [[Ashanti people|Ashanti]] in 1999, and [[Norodom Sihamoni]] of [[Cambodia]] in 2004.

===Display of power===
Such as ancient Roman triumphs, the [[Durbar (court)|durbar]] processions of [[India]], and modern reviewing of the troops by generals and heads of state. ''Return From Vienna'', a painting by [[Jozef Brandt]], shows war booty taken from the Turks being escorted into eastern [[Europe]] by soldiers.

===Entertainment===
Some processions are arranged for [[entertainment]], purely for [[fun]], such as those of community organizations and friendly societies, so popular in [[Great Britain]] and the [[United States of America]].

===Solidarity===
Religious ceremonies have since prehistory employed the procession of holy objects to inspire solidarity of belief. The [[Doge of Venice|Doges of Venice]] once staged elaborate [[barge]] processions to bless the waters on which Venice's tightly controlled maritime economy depended. Symbolic processions were an important tool in the non-violent protest of [[Mahatma Gandhi]]. Marches on political capitals often include formal processions. [[Gay Pride]] parades also started with this basis in [[New York City]].

===Events===
[[File:Academic dress KCL.jpg|thumb|175px|Graduation procession of [[King's College London]], one of the founding colleges of the [[University of London]], showcasing the academic dresses created by globally-renowned fashion designer [[Vivienne Westwood]] during the Summer 2008 graduation.]]

Processions used to mark the '''beginning or end of an event''', such as parades at the beginning of [[county fairs]] or at the [[Olympic Games]], or processions that begin and end [[funeral]]s, [[graduation]]s, and [[wedding]]s.

===Christian processions===
[[File:Chienbaese.ogv|left|thumb|200px|[[Chienbäse]] procession with burning wood bundles and fire carts in Liestal, Switzerland (2013)]]
Processions are found in almost every form of religious worship, such as [[Holy Week]] processions. Some biblical examples were the processions with the [[Ark of Covenant]] and the procession of [[Jesus on a donkey]] into Jerusalem.&lt;ref&gt;{{CathEncy|wstitle=Processions}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a narrower sense of going forth, proceeding, the term is used in the technical language of [[theology]] in the phrase Procession of the [[Holy Ghost]], expressing the relation of the Third Person in the Triune Godhead to the Father and the Son.

It is impossible to describe in detail the vast development of processions during the [[Middle Ages]]. The most important and characteristic of these still have a place in the ritual of the [[Catholic Church]], as well as those of the [[Church of England]] and the [[Eastern Orthodoxy|Orthodox Church]].

====Eastern Orthodox====

=====Outdoors=====

Typically the procession commences with the phanarion (a lantern) followed by the cross,&lt;ref group=note&gt;For which reason this is called in {{lang-ru|Крестный ход}}, ''Krestnyi khod'', ''cross procession''&lt;/ref&gt; flanked by processional [[Khorugv|banners]] and [[icons]], then choir and clergy, the deacons with [[Thurible#Eastern Orthodox and Eastern Catholic Usage|censers]], the priests with [[icon]]s, and then the faithful. Hymns particular to the event are sung. Typically the outside of the church is circled thrice; however, some processions proceed to a designated place where a ceremony, ''e.g.'', a baptism or burial, is performed.

*Well-known processions prescribed annually include:
**'''[[Easter|Pascha]] (Easter)''' &amp;mdash; During the [[Easter Vigil|Paschal Vigil]] at midnight on Easter Sunday.
**[[Easter Week|'''Bright Week''']] Each day following at the end of the [[Divine Liturgy]], when the [[Artos]] is carried and the paschal [[Canon (hymnography)|canon]] is sung.
**[[Holy Saturday|'''Great Saturday''']] With the [[Epitaphios (liturgical)|epitaphios]] carried around the church thrice, as at a priest's funeral, the choir singing the [[Trisagion]]&lt;ref group=note&gt;In some traditions, a procession takes place on [[Palm Sunday]] as well.&lt;/ref&gt;
**'''[[Epiphany (holiday)|Theophany]]''' &amp;mdash; When the [[Holy water#Blessing of holy water at Theophany|Great Blessing of Waters]] is at a body of water or an external [[baptistry]]&lt;ref group=note&gt;A similar procession takes place sundry other times when the [[Lesser Blessing of Waters]] is performed.&lt;/ref&gt;
**'''[[Paraklesis]]''' &amp;mdash; Often on the [[Patron Saint|patronal feast]] of a church, a procession around the outside of the church in conjunction with the paraklesis (prayer of intercession) to the church's namesake
** [[Lity (Orthodox Vespers)|'''Lity''']] &amp;mdash; May be held outdoors with a procession
** [[Holy Thursday#Local customs|'''Great Thursday''' &amp;mdash; Sundry local customs]]
*Well-known processions for occasional events include:
**'''[[Funeral]]''' &amp;mdash; The coffin is carried to the grave accompanied by singing of the [[Trisagion]].&lt;ref group=note&gt;If the deceased is a [[priest]] or [[bishop]] the clergy chant the [[Andrew of Crete|Great Canon of St. Andrew]]&lt;/ref&gt;
**[[Consecrations in Eastern Christianity#Consecration of a church|'''Consecration of a church''']] &amp;mdash; The relics to be placed in the altar are, after an [[all-night vigil]], carried in solemn procession to a nearby church, placed on the altar for an early divine liturgy, and then carried in solemn procession back to the church being consecrated.&lt;ref name=&quot;GBN&quot;&gt;{{Citation |year=2000 |publication-date=2000 |title=The Great Book of Needs: Expanded and Supplemented (Volume 2): The Sanctification of the Temple and other Ecclesiastical and Liturgical Blessings |pages=57 |place=[[South Canaan Township, Pennsylvania|South Canaan, Pennsylvania]] |publisher=[[Saint Tikhon's Orthodox Theological Seminary|Saint Tikhon's Seminary Press]] |isbn=1-878997-56-4 |url=http://www.stspress.com/products-page/service-books/great-book-of-needs-vol-2/ }}&lt;/ref&gt;

======Notable processions======

In 1991, the relics of [[Seraphim of Sarov|St. Seraphim of Sarov]] were rediscovered after being hidden in a [[Religion in the Soviet Union|Soviet anti-religious]] museum for seventy years. This caused a sensation in post-Soviet Russia, and indeed throughout the Orthodox world. A processionn was formed to escort the relics, on foot, all the way from Moscow to [[Serafimo-Diveevsky Monastery|St. Seraphim-Diveyevo Convent]], where they remain to this day. The [[Patriarch of Moscow]] himself took part in a portion of this procession.{{Citation needed|date=August 2013}}

During April 2, 2006 &amp;mdash; July 18, 2006 an international procession was carried out across [[Transnistria]], [[Ukraine]], [[Belarus]], and [[Russia]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://krhod.rossija.info/ International Krestny Khod]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|date=August 2013}}

====Roman Catholics====
For the Roman Catholic Church, the rules governing them are laid down in the [[Rituale Romanum]] (Tit. ix.), and they are classified in the following way:

# ''Processiones generales'', in which the whole body of the clergy takes part.
# ''Processiones ordinariae'', on yearly festivals, such as the feast of the [[Purification of the Virgin]] ([[Candlemas]]), the procession on [[Palm Sunday]] or [[Holy Week]], the ''[[Litaniae]] Majores'' and ''Minores'', the [[Corpus Christi (feast)|Feast of Corpus Christi]], [[Forty Hours' Devotion]] and on other days, according to the custom of the churches.
# Processiones extraordinariae, or processions ordered on special occasions, e.g. to pray for rain or fine weather; in time of storm, famine, plague, war, or, in ''quacumque tribulatione''; processions of thanksgiving; [[Translation (relic)|translation]] of [[relics]]; or the dedication of a church or a cemetery.

There are also processions of honor, for instance to meet a royal personage, or the [[bishop]] on his first entry into his [[diocese]] (Pontif. Tom. iii.).

Those taking part in processions are to walk bare-headed (weather permitting), two and two, in decent costume, and with reverent mien; clergy and laity, men and women, are to walk separately. The cross is carried at the head of the procession, and banners embroidered with sacred pictures in places where this is customary; these banners must not be of military or triangular shape. [[Violet (color)|Violet]] is the [[liturgical colours|prescribed colour]] for processions, except on Corpus Christi, or on a day when some other colour is mandated. The officiating priest wears a [[cope]], or at least a [[surplice]] with a violet stole, while other priests and clergy wear surplices.

Where the [[Sacramental bread#Catholic Church|Host]] is carried in procession (often encased in a [[monstrance]]), it is covered always by a canopy, and accompanied by lights. At the ''litaniae majores'' and ''minores'' and other penitential processions, joyful hymns are not allowed, but the litanies are sung, and, if the length of the procession requires, the penitential and [[gradual psalms]]. As to the discipline regarding processions the bishop, according to the [[Council of Trent]] (Sess. 25 de reg. cap. 6), appoints and regulates processions and public prayers outside the churches.

The observance or variation of the discipline belongs to the [[Congregation of Rites]]; in pontifical processions, which are regulated by the masters of the ceremonies (''magistri ceremoniarum pontificalium''), these points are decided by the chief cardinal deacon. As to processions within the churches, some difference of opinion having arisen as to the regulating authority, the Congregation of Rites has decided that the bishop must ask, though not necessarily follow, the advice of the chapter in their regulation.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Procession,&quot; The Encyclopædia Britannica, vol. 12 (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1911), 416.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Reformed churches====
[[File:Walsinghamprocession.jpg|thumb|Procession with the statue of the Blessed Virgin, Anglican National Pilgrimage at [[Walsingham]], 2003]]
The [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] abolished in all Protestant countries those processions associated with the doctrine of [[transubstantiation]] (Corpus Christi); the [[Eucharist|Sacrament of the Lord's Supper]], according to the 28th [[Thirty-nine Articles|Article of Religion]] of the Church of England was not by Christ's ordinance reserved, carried about, lifted up, or worshiped. It also abolished those associated with the cult of the Blessed Virgin and the saints. The stern simplicity of [[Calvinism]], indeed, would not tolerate religious processions of any kind, and from the Reformed Churches they vanished altogether. The more conservative temper of the Anglican and Lutheran communions, however, suffered the retention of such processions as did not conflict with the reformed doctrines, though even in these Churches they met with opposition and tended after a while to fall into disuse.

Liturgical processions were revived in the Church of England by the members of the [[Oxford Movement]] during the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;Cutts, E. L. (1895) ''A Dictionary of the Church of England''; 3rd ed. London: S. P. C. K.; p. 482&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Ritual Notes'', an Anglo-Catholic liturgical manual, it is stated that &quot;A solemn procession as part of the ceremony proper to the occasion, is ordered to be held respectively at Candlemas; on Palm Sunday; at the Rogations (i.e. on April 25th and the three days preceding Ascension); and on Corpus Christi ...&quot; &quot;A procession is a distinct act of worship in itself, though it is desirable (and accords with ancient practice) that it should have a definite purpose, such as to commemorate some notable event, or to honour the Blessed Sacrament&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Cairncross, Henry, et al., comps. (1935) ''Ritual Notes''; 8th ed. London: W. Knott; p. 104&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Lutheran]] practice has varied at different times and in different countries. Thus, according to the [[Württemberg]] Kirchenordnung of 1553, a funeral procession was prescribed, the bier being followed by the congregation singing hymns; the Brandenburg Kirchenordnung (1540) directed a cross-bearer to precede the procession and lighted candles to be carried, and this was prescribed also by the Waldeck Kirchenordnung of 1556. At present funeral processions survive in general only in the country districts; the processional cross or crucifix is still carried. In some provinces also the Lutheran Church has retained the ancient rogation processions in the week before Whitsuntide and, in some cases, in the month of May or on special occasions (e.g. days of humiliation, Busstage), processions about the fields to ask a blessing on the crops. On these occasions the ancient litanies are still used.

==History==
[[File:A Royal Procession.jpg|thumb|A Royal Procession]]
Processions have in all peoples and at all times been a natural form of public celebration, as forming an orderly and impressive ceremony. Religious and triumphal processions are abundantly illustrated by ancient monuments, e.g. the religious processions of Egypt, those illustrated by the rock-carvings of [[Hattusa|Boghaz-Keui]], the many representations of processions in Greek art, culminating in the great Panathenaic procession of the [[Parthenon Frieze]], and Roman triumphal reliefs, such as those of the [[arch of Titus]].

===Greco-Roman practice===
Processions played a prominent part in the great festivals of Greece, where they were always religious in character. The games were either opened or accompanied by more or less elaborate processions and sacrifices, while processions from the earliest times formed part of the worship of the old nature gods, as those connected with the [[cult of Dionysus]] and the [[Phallic processions]], and later formed an essential part of the celebration of the great religious festivals (e.g. the processions of the [[Thesmophoria]], and that of the [[Great Dionysia]]), and of the mysteries (e.g. the great procession from Athens to Eleusis, in connection with the [[Eleusinia]]).

Of the Roman processions, the most prominent was that of the [[Roman triumph|Triumph]], which had its origin in the return of the victorious army headed by the general, who proceeded in great pomp from the Campus to the Capitol to offer sacrifice, accompanied by the army, captives, spoils, the chief magistrate, priests bearing the images of the gods, amidst strewing of flowers, burning of incense and the like ([[Ovid]], ''Trist.'' iv. 2, 3 and 6). Connected with the triumph was the ''[[pompa circensis]]'', &lt;!--forthcoming article; please remove this note when link is blue--&gt;or solemn procession that preceded the games in the circus. It first came into use at the ''[[Ludi Romani]]'', when the games were preceded by a great procession from the Capitol to the Circus. The [[praetor]] or [[consul]] who appeared in the ponipa circensis wore the robes of a triumphing general (see Mommsen, Staatsrec/zt I. 397 for the connection of the triumph with the ''[[ludi]]''). Thus, when it became customary for the consul to celebrate games at the opening of the consular year, he came, under the empire, to appear in triumphal robes in the processus consularis, or procession of the consul to the Capitol to sacrifice to Jupiter.

===Christian practice===
[[File:Stuttgart 2009 040 (RaBoe).jpg|thumb|Christian Easter [[Passion (Christianity)|passion]] procession in Stuttgart, Germany (detail)]]
[[File:Anda0631.jpg|thumb|Christian Easter procession in Malaga, Spain]]

After the ascendency of Christianity in the [[Roman Empire]], the consular processions in [[Constantinople]] retained their religious character, now proceeding to [[Hagia Sophia]], where prayers and offerings were made; but in Rome, where Christianity was not so widely spread among the upper classes, at first the tendency was to convert the procession into a purely civil function, omitting the pagan rites and prayers, without substituting Christian ones&lt;ref&gt;Daremberg and Saglio, ''[[Dictionnaire des Antiquités Grecques et Romaines]]'', s.v. Consul.&lt;/ref&gt; Only after Theodosius did the processions become a religious event, replete with icons, crosses, and banners. There were other local processions connected with the primitive worship of the country people, which remained unchanged, but they were eventually overshadowed by the popular piety of the [[Early Church|Church]]. Such were those of the [[Ambarvalia]], [[Robigalia]], which were essentially rustic festivals, [[lustration]]s of the fields, consisting in a procession round the spot to be purified, leading the sacrificial victims with prayers, hymns, and ceremonies to protect the young crops from evil influence.&lt;ref&gt;See Preller, Rm. Mythologie, pp. 370-372.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Tertullian]] (2nd century) uses ''processio'' and ''procedere'' in the sense of to go out, appear in public, and, as applied to a church function, ''processio'' was first used in the same way as ''collecta'', i.e. for the assembly of the people in a church.&lt;ref&gt;[[Du Cange]], s.v.&lt;/ref&gt; In this sense it appears to be used by [[Pope Leo I]],&lt;ref&gt;Ep. IX. ad Diosc. episc. c. 445: ''qui nostris processionibus et ordinationibus frequenter interfuit''.&lt;/ref&gt; while in the version by [[Dionysius Exiguus]] of the 17th canon of the [[Council of Laodicea]] (about 363–364) ouv&amp;~eoi, is translated by ''processionibus''.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Dic. of Class. Antiq. s.v. Procession.&lt;/ref&gt;

For the processions that formed part of the ritual of the [[Catholic Mass|Eucharist]], those of the introit, the gospel and the oblation, the earliest records date from the 6th century and even later,&lt;ref&gt;See [[Louis Duchesne]], ''Origines'', 2nd ed., pp. 77, 154, 181; 78, 194.&lt;/ref&gt; but they evidently were established at a much earlier date. As to public processions, these seem to have come into rapid vogue after the recognition of Christianity as the religion of the empire. Those at [[Jerusalem]] would seem to have been long established when described by the author of the ''[[Egeria (pilgrim)|Peregrinatio Sylviae]]'' towards the end of the 4th century.

Very early were the processions accompanied by hymns and prayers, known as ''[[litaniae]]'', ''[[rogationes]]'' or ''[[supplicationes]]''. It is to such a procession that reference appears to be made in a letter of [[St Basil]],&lt;ref&gt;c. 375.&lt;/ref&gt; which would thus be the first recorded mention of a public Christian procession. The first mention for the Western Church occurs in [[St Ambrose]].&lt;ref&gt;c. 388, Ep. 40 16, Ad Theodos. ''monachos ... qui psalmos canentes ex consuetudine usuque veteri pergebant ad celebritatem Machabaeorum martyrum''.&lt;/ref&gt; In both these cases the litanies are stated to have been long in use. There is also mention of a procession accompanied by hymns, organized at Constantinople by [[St John Chrysostom]] (c. 390-400) in opposition to a procession of [[Arianism|Arians]], in [[Sozomen]].&lt;ref&gt;Hist. eccl. viii. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; In times of calamity litanies were held, in which the people walked in robes of penitence, fasting, barefooted, and, in later times, frequently dressed in black (''litaniae nigrae''). The cross was carried at the head of the procession and often the gospel and the relics of the saint were carried. [[Gregory of Tours]] gives numerous instances of such litanies in time of calamity; thus he describes&lt;ref&gt;Vita S. Remig. I.&lt;/ref&gt; a procession of the clergy and people round the city, in which relics of [[St Remigius]] were carried and litanies chanted in order to avert the plague. So, too, [[Gregory the Great]]&lt;ref&gt;Ep. xi. 57.&lt;/ref&gt; writes to the Sicilian bishops to hold processions to prevent a threatened invasion of Sicily. A famous instance of these penitential litanies is the ''litania septiformis'' ordered by Gregory the Great in the year 590, when Rome had been inundated and pestilence had followe

In this litany seven processions, of clergy, laymen, monks, nuns, matrons, the poor, and children respectively, starting from seven different churches, proceeding to hear mass at [[St. Maria Maggiore]].&lt;ref&gt;See [[Gregory of Tours]], Hist. Fr. x. i, and Johann. Diac. Vita Greg. Magn. i. 42.&lt;/ref&gt; This litany has often been confused with the ''litania major'', introduced at Rome in 598 (vide supra), but is quite distinct from it. Funeral processions, accompanied with singing and the carrying of lighted tapers, were very early customary (see [[ceremonial use of lights]]), and akin to these, also very early, were the processions connected with the translation of the relics of martyrs from their original burying place to the church where they were to be enshrined.&lt;ref&gt;See e.g. St Ambrose, Ep. 29 and St Augustine, De civitate Dei, xxii. 8 and Conf. viii. 7, for the finding and translation of the relics of Saints [[Gervasius and Protasius]].&lt;/ref&gt; From the time of the [[emperor Constantine I]] these processions were of great magnificence.

Some liturgists maintain that the early Church in its processions followed Old Testament precedents, quoting such cases as the procession of the [[ark of the covenant|ark]] round the walls of Jericho,&lt;ref&gt;Josh. vi.&lt;/ref&gt; the procession of David with the ark,&lt;ref&gt;2 Sam. vi.&lt;/ref&gt; the processions of thanksgiving on the return from captivity, &amp;c. The liturgy of the early Church as Duchesne shows&lt;ref&gt;Origines, ch. i.&lt;/ref&gt; was influenced by that of the Jewish synagogue, but the theory that the Church's processions were directly related to the Old Testament ritual is of late origin.

Festivals involving processions were adopted by the Christian Church from the pagan calendar of Rome. The ''litaniae majores et minores'', which are stated by [[Hermann Usener]]&lt;ref&gt;''Alte Bittgange'', in Zeller, ''Philosophische Aufsatze'', p. 278 seq.&lt;/ref&gt; to have been first instituted by [[Pope Liberius]] (352-366). It is generally acknowledged that they are the equivalent of the Christian Church of the Roman lustrations of the crops in spring, the [[Ambarvalia]], &amp;c. The ''litania major'', or great procession on St Mark's day (April 25) is shown to coincide both in date and ritual with the Roman [[Robigalia]], which took place ad. vii. Kal. Mai., and consisted in a procession leaving Rome by the [[Flaminian gate]], and proceeding by way of the [[Milvian bridge]] to a sanctuary at the 5th milestone of the [[Via Claudia]], where the flamen quirinalis sacrificed a dog and a sheep to avert blight (robigo) from the crops.&lt;ref&gt;Fasti praenestini, C.T.L.T., p. 317.&lt;/ref&gt; The litania major followed the same route as far as the Milvian bridge, when it turned off and returned to St Peter's, where mass was celebrated. This was already established as an annual festival by 598, as is shown by a document of [[Gregory the Great]]&lt;ref&gt;Regist. ii.&lt;/ref&gt; that inculcates the duty of celebrating litaniam, quae major ab omnibus appellatur. The ''litaniae minores'' or [[rogation]]s, held on the three days preceding [[Ascension Day]], were first introduced into Gaul by Bishop [[Mamertus of Vienne]] (c. 470), and made binding for all Gaul by the [[First Council of Orleans]] (511). The litaniae minores were also adopted for these three days in Rome by [[Pope Leo III]] (c. 800).

A description of the institution and character of the Ascensiontide rogations is given by [[Sidonius Apollinaris]].&lt;ref&gt;Ep. v. 14.&lt;/ref&gt; The solemnity of these, he says, was first established by Mamertus. Hitherto they had been erratic, lukewarm, and poorly attended (vagae, tepentes, infrequentesque). Those he instituted were characterized by fasting, prayers, psalms, and tears. In the Ambrosian rite the rogations take place after [[Ascension of Jesus Christ|Ascension]], and in the Spanish on the Thursday to Saturday after [[Whitsuntide]], and in November ([[Synod of Girona]], 517).

===Imperial China===
[[Dream of the Red Chamber|The Story of the Stone]], written in the 18th century, contains a description of the procession accompanying an Imperial Concubine:
{{quote|&lt;center&gt;
Presently a faint sound of music was heard and the Imperial Concubine's procession at last came in sight.
First came several pairs of [[eunuch]]s carrying embroidered banners.
Then several more pairs with [[ceremony|ceremonial]] pheasant-feather fans.
Then eunuchs swinging gold-inlaid censers in which special 'palace [[incense]]' was burning.
Next came a great gold-coloured 'seven phoenix' [[umbrella]] of state, hanging from its curve-topped shaft life a great drooping bell-flower.  In its shadow was borne the Imperial Concubine's travelling wardrobe: her head-dress, robe, sash and shoes. 
Eunuch gentlemen-in-waiting followed carrying her rosary, her embroidered handkerchief, her spittoon, her fly-whisk, and various other items.
Last of all, when this army of attendants had gone by, a great gold-topped [[Litter (vehicle)|palanquin]] with phoenixes embroidered on its yellow curtains slowly advanced on the shoulders of eight eunuch bearers.
&lt;/center&gt;

==Processions in art==
[[File:WLA lacma West Bengal Vase with Processional Scenes ca 100 BC.jpg|thumb|150px|Vase with Processional Scenes, [[West Bengal]]/[[Chandraketugarh]], circa 100 BC]]
The wealth of display associated with processions makes them a rich subject for literary and visual [[art]]. Some examples include:
* Processions were popular subjects for the [[romanticism|Romantic]] painters of the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Fantastical [[Ludwig II of Bavaria]] was the subject of ''Sleigh Ride'' by [[Wenig]]. ''Spring'', a painting by [[Sir Lawrence Alma-Tadema]], displays a romanticized Roman procession, while his ''[[The Finding of Moses (Alma-Tadema painting)|Finding of Moses]]'' shows an heiress of the Pharaoh proceeding to the palace with her [[wikt:entourage|entourage]]. The exotic ''Queen of Sheba's Visit to King Solomon'' by [[Edward Poynter]] touches on a longstanding convention of elaborate processions from &quot;the East&quot;. [[Walter Crane]] depicted Beauty being escorted by wigged monkeys in his 1874 ''Beauty and the Beast''.
* the opera ''[[Aida]]'' is known for its triumphal procession. The first staging included a live elephant on stage.
* the processions of [[Tarkhaan]]s and Tarkheenas are emblematic of Tashbaan's wealth and glamour in the book [[The Horse and His Boy]] by [[C. S. Lewis]]

===In film===
* elaborate Chinese [[wedding]] processions feature in the films ''[[Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon]]'' and ''[[The Last Emperor]]''
* in the film ''[[Pillow Book]]'', the [[heroine]] compares her wedding procession with the procession of a [[Heian Period]] empress. In another film by the same director, [[Peter Greenaway]], the act of [[Prospero]] simply walking through his house becomes a lush, visual procession because of the house's wealth of literary and visual symbolism.
* the Buddha discovers [[death]], old age, and [[poverty]] while watching an elaborate procession in the film ''[[Little Buddha]]''
* the Nazi entourage in ''[[Raiders of the Lost Ark]]'', upon arriving at their island base, begin an elaborate trek to the centre of the island, with soldiers holding aloft National Socialist standards. The procession is somewhat ostentatious given the climate, prompting the black-dressed Gestapo agent to remove his hat and wipe the sweat from his brow.
* the film ''[[Jefferson in Paris]]'' includes a scene during which [[Thomas Jefferson]] and his daughter watch one of the daily processions that make up the royal ritual at Versailles
[[File:Funeral Elisabeth.jpg|thumb|Illustration of part of the funeral procession of Queen Elizabeth I]]
* the funeral procession of [[Elizabeth I of England]] is portrayed in the film ''[[Orlando (film)|Orlando]]''
* the triumphal procession of [[Helen of Troy|Helen]] and [[Paris]] into [[Troy]] begins the 2004 film of the same name
* a spectacular procession introduces Prince Akeem's appointed bride in the film ''[[Coming to America]]''

;Fantasy
* a utopian parade is depicted by [[James Gurney]] in his ''Dinosaur Parade''
* Processions appear in several ''[[Star Wars]]'' films, including award ceremonies at the end of ''[[Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace|The Phantom Menace]]'' and ''[[Star Wars (film)|A New Hope]]'', a funeral procession at the end of ''[[Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith|Revenge of the Sith]]'', and a military procession during ''[[Return of the Jedi]]''
* the god [[Ra]] appears in a formal procession shortly before being overthrown in the film ''[[Stargate]]''
* the procession of [[Audrey Hepburn]] as an Italian [[princess]] set up the dilemma of her [[fictional character|character]] at the beginning of the film ''[[Roman Holiday (1953 film)|Roman Holiday]]''
* the procession of Prince Ali in the [[Walt Disney Pictures|Disney]] film ''[[Aladdin (1992 Disney film)|Aladdin]]'' allows the hero to show off his newfound prestige
* the procession of the wicked [[Skeksis]] into their regeneration chamber, and the following procession of their spiritual counterparts, the Mystics, marks the climax of the film ''[[Dark Crystal]]''

A '''ball''' is a formal [[dance party]].  

Attenders wear evening attire, which is specified on the invitation as ''[[black tie]]'' or ''[[white tie]]'' (the most formal){{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}. [[Social dance]] forms a large part of the evening; actual [[ballroom dancing]] may or may not occur.

==Etymology==
The word &quot;ball&quot; derives from the Latin word ''ballare'', meaning &quot;to dance&quot;; the Latin word also developed into [[French language|French]] ''baller''—from where it swapped into languages like English or German—, and ''bailar'', the [[Spanish language|Spanish]] and [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] verbs for &quot;to dance&quot; (although all three Romance languages also know ''danser'', ''danzar'' and ''dançar'' respectively). [[Catalan language|Catalan]] uses the same word, ''ball'', for the dance event.

==Types of balls==

*[[Commemoration ball]]
*[[Hunt ball]]
*[[Masquerade ball]]
*[[May Ball]]
*[[Dance party]]
*[[Prom]]

==Example of a country ball in Georgian England==
A well-documented ball occurred at [[Kingston Lacy]], Dorset, England, on 19 December 1791. The occasion was to celebrate the completion of major alterations to the house and the event was organised by Frances Bankes, wife of [[Henry Bankes]], owner of the house. The event involved 140 guests, with dancing from 9pm to 7am, interrupted by dinner at 1am.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.regencyhistory.net/2013/12/frances-bankes-ball-at-kingston-lacy-19.html |title=Frances Bankes' ball at Kingston Lacy 19 December 1791 (From Regency History) |publisher=Regency History.net |date= |accessdate=2014-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Black cocktail dress 1435042634.jpg|thumb|Black cocktail dress]]
[[File:Jw in vintage90.jpg|thumb|[[Jody Watley]] in a 1950s black sequined cocktail dress in 1990]]

A '''cocktail dress''' or '''cocktail gown''' is a woman's [[dress]] worn at [[Cocktail party|cocktail parties]] and semi-formal or &quot;[[black tie]]&quot; occasions.

Historically the length of a cocktail dress is long, often touching the ankle. When it is about 5 cm (2 inches) above the ankle it is called [[tea gown|''tea length'']] and when it is almost touching the ankle it is called ''ballerina length'', although  ballerina length dresses usually fall into the ''[[evening gown]]'' category.

The modern definition of a cocktail dress is commonly taken to mean a shorter dress above the knee. It must be smart, such as the [[little black dress]], and may have sequins or lace as a feature.

At semi-formal occasions, a less elaborate, shorter-length cocktail dress may be worn.  Prior to the mid 20th century this type of dress was known as 'late afternoon'. When gentlemen are in business suits, ladies also wear dress suits or &quot;good&quot; [[afternoon skirt]] and [[afternoon dress|dress]]es.

In the mid-20th century, some ''[[haute couture|couturier]]s''{{Who|date=August 2011}} began describing full-skirted cocktail gowns as &quot;dancing costumes&quot;.  These are suitable for formal dances but not for [[ball (formal dance)|ball]]s, or other [[white tie]] affairs, where [[ball gown]]s are worn.

[[Christian Dior]] was the first to use the term &quot;cocktail dress&quot; to refer to early evening wear, in the late 1940s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/coho/hd_coho.htm |title=Dressing for the Cocktail Hour | last1=da Cruz |first1=Elyssa |date=2000 |work=Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History |publisher=New York: The Metropolitan Museum of Art

'''Capri pants''' (also known as '''Capris''', '''crop pants''', long or three-quarter pants, and '''clam diggers''') are mid-calf [[trousers|pants]] worn in warm weather. Variants end below the knee and calf; they are widely popular with women, and men, in many countries, especially in the United States, Europe, Latin America, and Asia.

==History==
Capri pants were introduced by fashion designer [[Sonja de Lennart]] in 1948. The pants' name derives from the Italian isle of [[Capri]], where they rose to popularity in the late 1950s and early '60s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ancient&quot;&gt;&quot;Ancient Capri Still Casts Its Powerful Spell&quot;. (29 June 2008). ''[[Boston Globe]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; The American actress [[Grace Kelly]] was among the first movie stars who wore Capris on the island.

==Popularity==
Capris' acceptance in the United States was influenced by the 1960s television series ''[[The Dick Van Dyke Show]]''. The character Laura Petrie, the young housewife played by [[Mary Tyler Moore]], caused a fashion sensation – and some mild controversy – by wearing snug-fitting Capri pants during the show's run.&lt;ref name=&quot;Waldron2001&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Vince Waldron|title=The Official Dick Van Dyke Show Book: The Definitive History and Ultimate Viewer's Guide to Television's Most Enduring Comedy|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=BCTj8iffkKAC&amp;pg=PA128|year=2001|publisher=Applause|isbn=978-1-55783-453-9|pages=128–130}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the mid 1960s, Capri-style tight-fitting cargo pants became popular among teenage boys; a good example was the superstar teen actor of that era, [[Luke Halpin]], who wore them in some episodes of the popular ''[[Flipper (1964 TV series)]]''. After a drop in popularity during the 1970s through the 1990s, Capris returned to favor in the late 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=From Abba to Zoom: A Pop Culture Encyclopedia of the Late 20th Century|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=7GN0E_diWbAC&amp;pg=PA68|date=1 June 2005|publisher=Andrews McMeel Publishing|isbn=978-0-7407-9307-3|pages=68–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Spanish tennis player [[Rafael Nadal]] wore Capris in the majority of his matches [[Rafael Nadal#Equipment and endorsements|before 2009]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Ueda&quot;&gt;&quot;Ueda's Commentary on Modern Tennis Champions&quot;.

{{Main|Interview}}

A '''job interview''' is a one-on-one interview consisting of a conversation between a job applicant and a representative of an employer which is conducted to assess whether the applicant should be hired.&lt;ref name = &quot;Dipboye et al&quot;&gt;Dipboye, R. L., Macan, T., &amp; Shahani-Denning, C. (2012). The selection interview from the interviewer and applicant perspectives: Can't have one without the other. In N. Schmitt (Ed.), The Oxford handbook of personnel assessment and selection (pp. 323-352). New York City: Oxford University.&lt;/ref&gt; Interviews are one of the most popularly used devices for employee selection.&lt;ref&gt;Dipboye et al&lt;/ref&gt; Interviews vary in the extent to which the questions are structured, from a totally [[Unstructured interview|unstructured]] and free-wheeling conversation, to a [[structured interview]] in which an applicant is asked a predetermined list of questions in a specified order; &lt;ref&gt;Dipboye et al.&lt;/ref&gt; structured interviews are usually more accurate predictors of which applicants will make good employees, according to research studies.&lt;ref&gt;Wiesner, W. H., &amp; Cronshaw, S. F. (1988). A meta-analytic investigation of the impact of interview format and degree of structure on the validity of the employment interview. Journal of Occupational Psychology, 61(4), 275-290.&lt;/ref&gt;

A job interview typically precedes the [[Recruitment|hiring]] decision. The interview is usually preceded by the evaluation of submitted [[résumé]]s from interested candidates, possibly by examining job applications or reading many resumes. Next, after this screening, a small number of candidates for interviews is selected.

Potential job interview opportunities also include networking events and career fairs. The job interview is considered one of the most useful tools for evaluating potential employees.&lt;ref name=Chron&gt;{{cite web|url=http://work.chron.com/value-importance-job-interview-1660.html |title=The Value or Importance of a Job Interview |publisher=[[Houston Chronicle]] |accessdate=2014-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also demands significant resources from the employer, yet has been demonstrated to be notoriously unreliable in identifying the optimal person for the job.&lt;ref name=Chron/&gt;   An interview also allows the candidate to assess the [[corporate culture]] and demands of the job.

Multiple rounds of job interviews and/or other candidate selection methods may be used where there are many candidates or the job is particularly challenging or desirable. Earlier rounds sometimes called 'screening interviews' may involve fewer staff from the employers and will typically be much shorter and less in-depth. An increasingly common initial interview approach is the telephone interview. This is especially common when the candidates do not live near the employer and has the advantage of keeping costs low for both sides. Since 2003, interviews have been held through video conferencing software, such as [[Skype]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.brandeis.edu/hiatt/howto/interview/index.html |title=INTRODUCTION TO INTERVIEWING |publisher=[[Brandeis University]] |accessdate=2015-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once all candidates have been interviewed, the employer typically selects the most desirable candidate(s) and begins the negotiation of a job offer.

==Interview constructs==
In light of its popularity, a stream of research has attempted to identify the constructs (ideas or concepts) that are measured during the interview to understand why interviews might help to pick the right people for the job. Several reviews of the research on interview constructs revealed that the interview captures a wide variety of applicant attributes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Huffcutt, A. I. 2011&quot;&gt;Huffcutt, A. I. (2011). An empirical review of the employment interview construct literature. International Journal of Selection and Assessment, 19(1), 62–81.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Huffcutt, A. I. 2001&quot;&gt;Huffcutt, A. I., Conway, J. M., Roth, P. L., &amp; Stone, N. J. (2001). Identification and meta-analytic assessment of psychological constructs measured in employment interviews. Journal of Applied Psychology, 86, 897–913.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Salgado, J. F. 2002&quot;&gt;Salgado, J. F., &amp; Moscoso, S. (2002). Comprehensive meta-analysis of the construct validity of the employment interview. European Journal of Work and Organizational Psychology, 11, 299–324.&lt;/ref&gt; These constructs can be classified into three categories: job-relevant interview content (constructs interview questions are designed to assess), interviewee performance (applicant behaviors unrelated to the applicant characteristics the interview questions are designed to assess but nevertheless influence interviewer evaluations of interviewee responses), and potentially job-irrelevant interviewer biases (personal and demographic characteristics of applicants that may influence interviewer evaluations of interviewee responses in an illegal, discriminatory way).

'''Job-relevant interview content'''
Interview questions are generally designed to tap applicant attributes that are specifically relevant to the job for which the person is applying. The job-relevant applicant attributes that the questions purportedly assess are thought to be necessary for one to successfully perform on the job. The job-relevant constructs that have been assessed in the interview can be classified into three categories: general traits, experiential factors, and core job elements. The first category refers to relatively stable applicant traits. The second category refers to job knowledge that the applicant has acquired over time. The third category refers to the knowledge, skills, and abilities associated with the job.
 
'''General traits:'''
* Mental ability: Applicants' capacity to learn and process information&lt;ref name=&quot;Huffcutt, A. I. 2001&quot;/&gt;
* Personality: Conscientiousness, agreeableness, emotional stability, extroversion, openness to new experiences&lt;ref name=&quot;Huffcutt, A. I. 2011&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Huffcutt, A. I. 2001&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Salgado, J. F. 2002&quot;/&gt;
* Interest, goals, and values: Applicant motives, goals, and person-organization fit&lt;ref name=&quot;Huffcutt, A. I. 2001&quot;/&gt;
'''Experiential factors:'''
* Experience: Job-relevant knowledge derived from prior experience&lt;ref name=&quot;Huffcutt, A. I. 2001&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Salgado, J. F. 2002&quot;/&gt;
* Education: Job-relevant knowledge derived from prior education
* Training: Job-relevant knowledge derived from prior training
'''Core job elements:'''
* Declarative knowledge: Applicants' learned knowledge&lt;ref name=&quot;Salgado, J. F. 2002&quot;/&gt;
* Procedural skills and abilities: Applicants' ability to complete the tasks required to do the job&lt;ref&gt;Morgeson, R. P., Reider, M. H., &amp; Campion, M. A. (2005). Selecting individual in team settings: The importance of social skills, personality characteristics, and teamwork knowledge. Personnel Psychology, 58, 583–611.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Motivation: Applicants' willingness to exert the effort required to do the job&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, J. P., McCloy, R. A., Oppler, S. H., &amp; Sager, C. E. (1993). A theory of performance. In N. Schmitt &amp; W. C. Borman (Eds.), Personnel selection in organizations (pp. 35–70). San Francisco: Jossey-Bass.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Interviewee performance'''
Interviewer evaluations of applicant responses also tend to be colored by how an applicant behaves in the interview. These behaviors may not be directly related to the constructs the interview questions were designed to assess, but can be related to aspects of the job for which they are applying. Applicants without realizing it may engage in a number of behaviors that influence ratings of their performance. The applicant may have acquired these behaviors during training or from previous interview experience. These interviewee performance constructs can also be classified into three categories: social effectiveness skills, interpersonal presentation, and personal/contextual factors.
 
'''Social effectiveness skills:'''
* Impression management: Applicants' attempt to make sure the interviewer forms a positive impression of them&lt;ref&gt;Schlenker, B. R. 1980.

Differential effectiveness of applicant impression management tactics on employment interview decisions. Journal of Applied Social Psychology, 22, 1250–1272.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Social skills: Applicants' ability to adapt his/her behavior according to the demands of the situation to positively influence the interviewer&lt;ref&gt;Ferris, G. R., Witt, L. A., &amp; Hochwarter, W. A. (2001). Interaction of social skill and general mental ability on job performance and salary. Journal of Applied Psychology, 86, 1075–1082.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Self-monitoring: Applicants' regulation of behaviors to control the image presented to the interviewer&lt;ref&gt;Snyder, M. (1974). Self-monitoring of expressive behavior. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 30, 526–537.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Relational control: Applicants' attempt to control the flow of the conversation&lt;ref&gt;Tuller, W. L. (1989). Relational control in the employment interview. Journal of Applied Psychology, 74, 971–977.&lt;/ref&gt;
'''Interpersonal Presentation:'''

Journal of Organizational Behavior, 29, 265–285.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Job-irrelevant interviewer biases'''
The following are personal and demographic characteristics that can potentially influence interviewer evaluations of interviewee responses. These factors are typically not relevant to whether the individual can do the job (that is, not related to [[job performance]]), thus, their influence on interview ratings should be minimized or excluded. In fact, there are laws in many countries that prohibit consideration of many of these protected classes of people when making selection decisions. Using structured interviews with multiple interviewers coupled with training may help reduce the effect of the following characteristics on interview ratings.&lt;ref name=&quot;McCarthy, J. M. 2010&quot;&gt;McCarthy, J. M., Van Iddekinge, C. H., &amp; Campion, M. A. (2010). Are highly structured job interviews resistant to demographic similarity effects? Personnel Psychology, 63, 325–359.&lt;/ref&gt; The list of job-irrelevant interviewer biases is presented below. 
* Attractiveness: Applicant physical attractiveness can influence interviewer's evaluation of one's interview performance&lt;ref name=&quot;Burnett, J. R. 1998&quot;/&gt;
* Race: Whites tend to score higher than Blacks and Hispanics;&lt;ref&gt;Huffcutt, A. I., &amp; Roth, P. L. (1998). Racial group differences in employment interview evaluations. Journal of Applied Psychology, 83, 179–189.&lt;/ref&gt; racial similarity between interviewer and applicant, on the other hand, has not been found to influence interview ratings&lt;ref name=&quot;McCarthy, J. M. 2010&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McFarland, L. A., Ryan, A. M., Sacco, J. M., &amp; Kriska, S. D. (2004). Examination of structured interview ratings across time: The effects of applicant race, rater race, and panel composition. Journal of Management, 30, 435–452.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Gender: Females tend to receive slightly higher interview scores than their male counterparts;&lt;ref name=&quot;Huffcutt, A. I. 2011&quot;/&gt; gender similarity does not seem to influence interview ratings&lt;ref name=&quot;McCarthy, J. M. 2010&quot;/&gt;
* Similarities in background and attitudes: Interviewers perceived interpersonal attraction was found to influence interview ratings&lt;ref&gt;Wade, K. J., &amp; Kinicki, A. J. (1997). Subjective applicant qualifications and interpersonal attraction as mediators within a process model of interview selection decisions. Journal of Vocational Behavior, 50, 23–40.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Culture: Applicants with an ethnic name and a foreign accent were viewed less favorably than applicants with just an ethnic name and no accent or an applicant with a traditional name with or without an accent&lt;ref&gt;Purkiss, S. L. S., Perrewé, P. L., Gillespie, T. L., Mayes, B. T., &amp; Ferris, G. R. (2006). Implicit sources of bias in employment interview judgments and decisions. ''Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes'', 101, 152–167.&lt;/ref&gt;

The extent to which ratings of interviewee performance reflect certain constructs varies widely depending on the level of structure of the interview, the kind of questions asked, interviewer or applicant biases, applicant professional dress or nonverbal behavior, and a host of other factors. For example, some research suggests that applicant's cognitive ability, education, training, and work experiences may be better captured in unstructured interviews, whereas applicant's job knowledge, organizational fit, interpersonal skills, and applied knowledge may be better captured in a structured interview.&lt;ref name=&quot;Huffcutt, A. I. 2001&quot;/&gt;

Further, interviews are typically designed to assess a number of constructs. Given the social nature of the interview, applicant responses to interview questions and interviewer evaluations of those responses are sometimes influenced by constructs beyond those the questions were intended to assess, making it extremely difficult to tease out the specific constructs measured during the interview.&lt;ref&gt;Roth, P. L., Van Iddekinge, C. H., Huffcutt, A. I., Eidson, C E. Jr., &amp; Schmit, M. J. (2005). Personality saturation in structured interviews. International Journal of Selection and Assessment, 13, 261–273.&lt;/ref&gt; Reducing the number of constructs the interview is intended to assess may help mitigate this issue. Moreover, of practical importance is whether the interview is a better measure of some constructs in comparison to paper and pencil tests of the same constructs. Indeed, certain constructs (mental ability and skills, experience) may be better measured with paper and pencil tests than during the interview, whereas personality-related constructs seem to be better measured during the interview in comparison to paper and pencil tests of the same personality constructs.&lt;ref&gt;Dipboye, R. L., Macan, T., &amp; Shahani-Denning, C. (in press). The selection interview from the interviewer and applicant perspectives: Can't have one without the other.  The Oxford Handbook of Personnel Assessment and Selection.&lt;/ref&gt; In sum, the following is recommended: Interviews should be developed to assess the job relevant constructs identified in the job analysis.&lt;ref&gt;Van Iddekinge, C. H., Raymark, P. H., &amp; Roth, P. L. (2005). Assessing personality with a structured employment interview: Construct-related validity and susceptibility to response inflation. Journal of Applied Psychology, 90(3), 536–552.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Klehe, U. C., &amp; Latham, G. P. (2005).

==Interview process==
[[File:People waiting to be interviewed at the employment agency 8d18038v.jpg|thumb|right|200px|People waiting to be interviewed at an employment agency.]]
One way to think about the interview process is as three separate, albeit related, phases: (1) the preinterview phase which occurs before the interviewer and candidate meet, (2) the interview phase where the interview is conducted, and (3) the postinterview phase where the interviewer forms judgments of candidate qualifications and makes final decisions.&lt;ref name=&quot;MD88&quot;&gt;Dipboye, R. L., &amp; Macan, T. (1988). A process view of the selection-recruitment interview. In R.Schuler, V.Huber, &amp; S.Youngblood (Eds.), Readings in personnel and human resource management (pp. 217–232). New York: West.&lt;/ref&gt; Although separate, these three phases are related.  That is, impressions interviewers form early on may affect how they view the person in a later phase.

'''Preinterview phase''':
The preinterview phase encompasses the information available to the interviewer beforehand (e.g., resumes, test scores, social networking site information) and the perceptions interviewers form about applicants from this information prior to the actual face-to-face interaction between the two individuals. In this phase, interviewers are likely to already have ideas about the characteristics that would make a person ideal or qualified for the position.&lt;ref name=&quot;DMS&quot;&gt;Dipboye, R. L., Macan, T., &amp; Shahani-Denning, C. (in press). The selection interview from the interviewer and applicant perspectives: Can’t have one without the other. Oxford Handbook of I/O Psychology.&lt;/ref&gt; Interviewers also have information about the applicant usually in the form of a resume, test scores, or prior contacts with the applicant.&lt;ref name=&quot;MD88&quot;/&gt;  Interviewers then often integrate information that they have on an applicant with their ideas about the ideal employee to form a preinterview evaluation of the candidate. In this way, interviewers typically have an impression of you even before the actual face-to-face interview interaction. Nowadays with recent technological advancements, we must be aware that interviewers have an even larger amount of information available on some candidates. For example, interviewers can obtain information from search engines (e.g. Google, Bing, Yahoo), blogs, and even social networks (e.g. Linkedin, Facebook, Twitter). While some of this information may be job-related, some of it may not be. In some cases, a review of Facebook may reveal undesirable behaviors such as drunkenness or drug use. Despite the relevance of the information, any information interviewers obtain about the applicant before the interview is likely to influence their preinterview impression of the candidate. And, why is all this important? It is important because what interviewers think about you before they meet you, can have an effect on how they might treat you in the interview and what they remember about you.&lt;ref name=&quot;MD88&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;MD88Effect&quot;&gt;Macan, T., &amp; Dipboye, R. L. (1988). The effect of interviewer’s initial impressions on information gathering. ''Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes'', 42(3), 364–387.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, researchers have found that what interviewers think about the applicant before the interview (preinterview phase) is related to how they evaluate the candidate after the interview, despite how the candidate may have performed during the interview.&lt;ref name=&quot;MD90&quot;&gt;Macan, T., &amp; Dipboye, R. L. (1990). The relationship of interviewers’ preinterview impressions to selection and recruitment outcomes. Personnel Psychology, 43(4), 745–768. Retrieved from EBSCOhost.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Interview phase''':
The interview phase entails the actual conduct of the interview, the interaction between the interviewer and the applicant. Initial interviewer impressions about the applicant before the interview may influence the amount of time an interviewer spends in the interview with the applicant, the interviewer’s behavior and questioning of the applicant,&lt;ref name=&quot;Dipboye82&quot;&gt;Dipboye, R. L. (1982). Self-Fulfilling Prophecies in the Selection-Recruitment Interview. Academy of Management Review, 7(4), 579–586. Retrieved from EBSCOhost.&lt;/ref&gt; and the interviewer’s postinterview evaluations.&lt;ref name=&quot;MD90&quot;/&gt; Preinterview impressions also can affect what the interviewer notices about the interviewee, recalls from the interview, and how an interviewer interprets what the applicant says and does in the interview.&lt;ref name=&quot;MD88Effect&quot;/&gt;

As interviews are typically conducted face-to-face, over the phone, or through video conferencing&lt;ref&gt;Straus, S. G., Milesb, J. A., &amp; Levesquec, L. L. (2001). The effects of videoconference, telephone, and face-to-face media on interviewer and applicant judgments in employment interviews. Journal of Management, 27(3), 363–381.&lt;/ref&gt; (e.g. Skype), they are a social interaction between at least two individuals. Thus, the behavior of the interviewer during the interview likely &quot;leaks&quot; information to the interviewee. That is, you can sometimes tell during the interview whether the interviewer thinks positively or negatively about you.&lt;ref name=&quot;MD88&quot;/&gt; Knowing this information can actually affect how the applicant behaves, resulting in a self-fulfilling prophecy effect.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dipboye82&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Word, C. O., Zanna, M. P., &amp; Cooper, J. (1974). The nonverbal mediation of self-fulfilling prophecies in interracial interaction. Journal of Experimental Social Psychology, 10, 109–120.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, interviewees who feel the interviewer does not think they are qualified may be more anxious and feel they need to prove they are qualified. Such anxiety may hamper how well they actually perform and present themselves during the interview, fulfilling the original thoughts of the interviewer. Alternatively, interviewees who perceive an interviewer believes they are qualified for the job may feel more at ease and comfortable during the exchange, and consequently actually perform better in the interview. It should be noted again, that because of the dynamic nature of the interview, the interaction between the behaviors and thoughts of both parties is a continuous process whereby information is processed and informs subsequent behavior, thoughts, and evaluations.

'''Postinterview phase''':
After the interview is conducted, the interviewer must form an evaluation of the interviewee’s qualifications for the position. The interviewer most likely takes into consideration all the information, even from the preinterview phase, and integrates it to form a postinterview evaluation of the applicant. In the final stage of the interview process, the interviewer uses his/her evaluation of the candidate (i.e., in the form of interview ratings or judgment) to make a final decision. Sometimes other selection tools (e.g., work samples, cognitive ability tests, personality tests) are used in combination with the interview to make final hiring decisions; however, interviews remain the most commonly used selection device in North America.&lt;ref&gt;Ryan, A., McFarland, L., Baron, H., &amp; Page, R. (1999). An international look at selection practices: Nation and culture as explanations for variability in practice. Personnel Psychology, 52(2), 359–391.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''For interviewees''':
Although the description of the interview process above focuses on the perspective of the interviewer, job applicants also gather information on the job and/or organization and form impressions prior to the interview.&lt;ref name=&quot;DMS&quot;/&gt; The interview is a two-way exchange and applicants are also making decisions about whether the company is a good fit for them. Essentially, the process model illustrates that the interview is not an isolated interaction, but rather a complex process that begins with two parties forming judgments and gathering information, and ends with a final interviewer decision.

==Types of interview==
Interviews may be 'structured', 'unstructured' and composite: i.e. comprising a combination of both types or interview approach. There are also a large range of more specialised interview approaches. Interviews typically take place face-to-face, though other modes such as telephone or video are increasingly used.

===Structured interview===
In interviews that are considered &quot;structured interviews,&quot; there are several types of questions interviewers ask applicants. Two major types are situational questions&lt;ref name=&quot;Latham, G. P. 1980&quot;&gt;Latham, G. P., Saari, L. M., Pursell, E. D., &amp; Campion, M. A. (1980).  The situational interview. Journal of Applied Psychology, 65, 422–427.&lt;/ref&gt; and behavioral questions (also known as patterned behavioral description interviews).&lt;ref&gt;Janz, T. (1982). Initial comparison of patterned behavior description interviews versus unstructured interviews.  Journal of Applied Psychology, 67, 577–580.&lt;/ref&gt; Both types of questions are based on &quot;critical incidents&quot; that are required to perform the job&lt;ref name=&quot;Flanagan, J. C. 1954&quot;&gt;Flanagan, J. C. (1954). The critical incident technique. Psychological Bulletin, 51, 327–359.&lt;/ref&gt; but they differ in their focus (see below for descriptions). Critical incidents are relevant tasks that are required for the job and can be collected through interviews or surveys with current employees, managers, or subject matter experts&lt;ref&gt;Weekley J. A., &amp; Gier, J. A. (1987). Reliability and validity of the situational interview for a sales position. Journal of Applied Psychology, 72. 484–487.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Campion, M. A. 1997&quot;&gt;Campion, M. A., Palmer, D. K., &amp; Campion J. E. (1997). A review of structure in the selection interview. Personnel Psychology, 50, 655–702.&lt;/ref&gt; One of the first critical incidents techniques ever used in the United States Army asked combat veterans to report specific incidents of effective or ineffective behavior of a leader.  The question posed to veterans was &quot;Describe the officer’s actions.  What did he do?&quot;  Their responses were compiled to create a factual definition or &quot;critical requirements&quot; of what an effective combat leader is.&lt;ref name=&quot;Flanagan, J. C. 1954&quot;/&gt;

Previous meta-analyses have found mixed results for which type of question will best predict future job performance of an applicant.  For example, some studies have shown that situational type questions have better predictability for job performance in interviews,&lt;ref&gt;Conway, J. M., &amp; Huffcutt, A. I. (1997). Effects of reliability, constructs, and job on structured interview validity. Paper presented at the 12th Annual Conference of the Society for Industrial and Organizational Psychology, St Louis, MO.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McDaniel, M. A., Whetzel, D. L., Schmidt, F. L., &amp; Maurer, S. (1994). The validity of employment interviews: A comprehensive review and meta-analysis. Journal of Applied Psychology, 79, 599–616.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Searcy, C. A., Woods, P. N., Gatewood, R., &amp; Lance, C. (1993). The validity of structured interviews: A meta-analytical search for moderators. Paper presented at the Annual Conference of the Society for Industrial and Organizational Psychology , San Francisco, CA.&lt;/ref&gt; while, other researchers have found that behavioral type questions are better at predicting future job performance of applicants.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, P. J. &amp; Small, B. (2002). Asking applicants what they would do versus what they did do: A meta-analytic comparison of situational and past behavior employment interview questions. Journal of Occupational and Organizational Psychology, 75, 277–294.&lt;/ref&gt; In actual interview settings it is not likely that the sole use of just one type of interview question (situational or behavioral) is asked. A range of questions can add variety for both the interviewer and applicant.&lt;ref name=&quot;Campion, M. A. 1997&quot;/&gt; In addition, the use of high-quality questions, whether behavioral or situational based, is essential to make sure that candidates provide meaningful responses that lead to insight into their capability to perform on the job.&lt;ref name=&quot;Huffcutt, A. I. 2010&quot;&gt;Huffcutt, A. I. (2010). From science to practice: Seven principles for conducting employment interviews. Applied H.R.M., 12, 121–136.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Situational interview questions====
Situational interview questions&lt;ref name=&quot;Latham, G. P. 1980&quot;/&gt; ask job applicants to imagine a set of circumstances and then indicate how they would respond in that situation; hence, the questions are future oriented. One advantage of situational questions is that all interviewees respond to the same hypothetical situation rather than describe experiences unique to them from their past.  Another advantage is that situational questions allow respondents who have had no direct job experience relevant to a particular question to provide a hypothetical response.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pulakos, E. D. 1995&quot;/&gt; Two core aspects of the SI are the development of situational dilemmas that employees encounter on the job, and a scoring guide to evaluate responses to each dilemma.&lt;ref name=&quot;Latham, G. P. 1999&quot;&gt;Latham, G. P. &amp; Sue-Chan, C. (1999). A meta-analysis of the situational interview:
An enumerative review of reasons for its validity. Canadian Psychology, 40, 56–67.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Behavioral interview questions====
Behavioral (experience-based or patterned behavioral) interviews are past-oriented in that they ask respondents to relate what they did in past jobs or life situations that are relevant to the particular job relevant knowledge, skills, and abilities required for success.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Janz|first=T.|title=Initial comparison of patterned behavior description interviews versus unstructured interviews.|journal=Journal of Applied Psychology|year=1982|volume=67|pages=577–580|doi=10.1037/0021-9010.67.5.577}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Motowidlo|first=S.J.|author2=Carter, G.W. |author3=Dunnette, M.D. |author4=Tippins, N. |author5=Werner, S. |author6=Burnett, J.R. |author7=Vaughn, M.J. |title=Studies of the structured behavioral interview.|journal=Journal of Applied Psychology|volume=77|pages=571–587 |doi=10.1037/0021-9010.77.5.571}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The idea is that past behavior is the best predictor of future performance in similar situations. By asking questions about how job applicants have handled situations in the past that are similar to those they will face on the job, employers can gauge how they might perform in future situations.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pulakos, E. D. 1995&quot;&gt;Pulakos, E. D., &amp; Schmitt, N. (1995). Experienced-based and situational interview questions: Studies of validity. Personnel Psychology, 48, 289–308.&lt;/ref&gt;

Behavioral interview questions include:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rehn|first1=Karen|title=Behavioral Based Interview Questions. Master Your Fears!|url=http://hhstaffingservices.com/behavioral-based-interview-questions-master-your-fears/|publisher=HHStaffing|accessdate=8 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Describe a situation in which you were able to use persuasion to successfully convince someone to see things your way.
* Give me an example of a time when you set a goal and were able to meet or achieve it.
* Tell me about a time when you had to use your presentation skills to influence someone's opinion.
* Give me an example of a time when you had to conform to a policy with which you did not agree.

Examples include the [[Situation, Task, Action, Result|STAR]] and [[SOARA]] techniques.

====Other types of interview questions====
Other possible types of questions that may be asked alongside structured interview questions or in a separate interview include: background questions, job experience questions, and puzzle type questions.  A brief explanation of each follows.

* Background questions include a focus on work experience, education, and other qualifications.&lt;ref&gt;Roth P. L., Campion J. E. (1992). An analysis of the predictive power of the panel interview and pre-employment tests. Journal of Occupational and Organizational Psychology, 65, 51–60.&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, an interviewer may ask &quot;What experience have you had with direct sales phone calls?&quot;
* Job experience questions may ask candidates to describe or demonstrate job knowledge.  These are typically highly specific questions.&lt;ref&gt;Arvey, R. D., Howard, E. M., Gould, R. &amp; Burch, P. (1987). Interview validity for selecting sales clerks. Personnel Psychology, 40, 1–12.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, one question may be &quot;What steps would you take to conduct a manager training session on safety?&quot;
* The puzzle interview was popularized by Microsoft in the 1990s, and is now used in other organizations. The most common types of questions either ask the applicant to solve puzzles or [[brain teaser]]s (e.g., &quot;Why are manhole covers round?&quot;) or to solve unusual problems (e.g., &quot;How would you weigh an airplane without a scale?&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Honer, J., Wright, C. W., &amp; Sablynski, C. J. |year=2007 |title=Puzzle interviews: What are they and what do the measure? Applied H.R.M.

===Specialized interview formats===

====Case====
{{Further|Case interview}}
A case interview is an interview form used mostly by management consulting firms and investment banks in which the job applicant is given a question, situation, problem or challenge and asked to resolve the situation. The case problem is often a business situation or a business case that the interviewer has worked on in real life.
In recent years, company in other sectors like Design, Architecture, Marketing, Advertising, Finance and Strategy have adopted a similar approach to interviewing candidates. Technology has transformed the Case-based and Technical interview process from a purely private in-person experience to an online exchange of job skills and endorsements.

====Panel====
Another type of job interview found throughout the professional and academic ranks is the ''panel interview''.  In this type of interview the candidate is interviewed by a group of panelists representing the various stakeholders in the hiring process.  Within this format there are several approaches to conducting the interview.  Example formats include; 
* Presentation format – The candidate is given a generic topic and asked to make a presentation to the panel.  Often used in academic or sales-related interviews.
* Role format – Each panelist is tasked with asking questions related to a specific role of the position.  For example, one panelist may ask technical questions, another may ask management questions, another may ask customer service related questions etc.
* Skeet shoot format – The candidate is given questions from a series of panelists in rapid succession to test his or her ability to handle stress filled situations.

The benefits of the panel approach to interviewing include: time savings over serial interviewing, more focused interviews as there is often less time spend building rapport with small talk, and &quot;[[Apples and oranges|apples to apples]]&quot; comparison because each stake holder/interviewer/panelist gets to hear the answers to the same questions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.staffing-and-recruiting-essentials.com/Panel-Interview.html |title=Panel Interview - The good, the bad and what do look out for! |publisher=Staffing-and-recruiting-essentials.com |date=2011-02-09 |accessdate=2012-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Stress====
Stress interviews are still in common use. One type of stress interview is where the employer uses a succession of interviewers (one at a time or ''en masse'') whose mission is to intimidate the candidate and keep him/her off-balance. The ostensible purpose of this interview: to find out how the candidate handles stress. Stress interviews might involve testing an applicant's behavior in a busy environment. Questions about handling work overload, dealing with multiple projects, and handling conflict are typical.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.money-zine.com/Definitions/Career-Dictionary/Stress-Interview/ |title=Stress Interview |publisher=Money-zine.com |accessdate=2012-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another type of stress interview may involve only a single interviewer who behaves in an uninterested or hostile manner. For example, the interviewer may not make eye contact, may roll his eyes or sigh at the candidate's answers, interrupt, turn his back, take phone calls during the interview, or ask questions in a demeaning or challenging style. The goal is to assess how the interviewee handles pressure or to purposely evoke emotional responses. This technique was also used in research protocols studying [[workplace stress|stress]] and type A (coronary-prone) behavior because it would evoke hostility and even changes in [[blood pressure]] and heart rate in study subjects. The key to success for the candidate is to de-personalize the process. The interviewer is acting a role, deliberately and calculatedly trying to &quot;rattle the cage&quot;. Once the candidate realizes that there is nothing personal behind the interviewer's approach, it is easier to handle the questions with aplomb.

Example stress interview questions:
* Sticky situation: &quot;If you caught a colleague cheating on his expenses, what would you do?&quot;
* Putting one on the spot: &quot;How do you feel this interview is going?&quot;
* &quot;Popping the balloon&quot;: (deep sigh) &quot;Well, if that's the best answer you can give ... &quot; (shakes head) &quot;Okay, what about this one ...?&quot;
* Oddball question: &quot;What would you change about the design of the hockey stick?&quot;
* Doubting one's veracity: &quot;I don't feel like we're getting to the heart of the matter here. Start again – tell me what ''really'' makes you tick.&quot;
 
Candidates may also be asked to deliver a [[presentation]] as part of the selection process. One stress technique is to tell the applicant that they have 20 minutes to prepare a presentation, and then come back to room five minutes later and demand that the presentation be given immediately. The &quot;Platform Test&quot; method involves having the candidate make a presentation to both the selection panel and other candidates for the same job. This is obviously highly stressful and is therefore useful as a predictor of how the candidate will perform under similar circumstances on the job. Selection processes in academic, training, airline, legal and teaching circles frequently involve presentations of this sort. &lt;!-- http://0-www.mopp.qut.edu.au.innopac.up.ac.za:80/B/B_04_04.html Can someone find citation info for this, format it, and verify? --&gt;

====Technical====
{{Further|Microsoft Interview}}
This kind of interview focuses on problem solving and creativity. The questions aim at the interviewee's problem-solving skills and likely show their ability in solving the challenges faced in the job through creativity. Technical interviews are being conducted online at progressive companies before in-person talks as a way to screen job applicants.

===Other interview modes===

====Telephone====
{{Main|Telephone interview}}
Telephone interviews take place if a recruiter wishes to reduce the number of prospective candidates before deciding on a [[shortlist]] for face-to-face interviews. They also take place if a job applicant is a significant distance away from the premises of the hiring company, such as abroad or in another state or province.

====Video====
Video interviews are a modern variation of telephone interviews. Prospective candidates are asked preset questions using computer software then their immediate responses are recorded. These responses are then viewed and evaluated by recruiters to form a shortlist of suitable candidates for face-to-face interviews.

==Interviewee strategies and behaviors==
While preparing for an interview, prospective [[employees]] usually look at what the job posting or job description says in order to get a better understanding of what is expected of them should they get hired. Exceptionally good interviewees look at the wants and needs of a job posting and show off how good they are at those abilities during the interview to impress the interviewer and increase their chances of getting a job.

Researching the [[company]] itself is also a good way for interviewees to impress lots of people during an interview. It shows the interviewer that the interviewee is not only knowledgeable about the company's goals and [[Goal|objectives]], but also that the interviewee has done their [[homework]] and that they make a great effort when they are given an assignment. Researching about the company makes sure that employees are not entirely clueless about the company they are applying for, and at the end of the interview, the interviewee might ask some questions to the interviewer about the company, either to learn more information or to clarify on some points that they might have found during their research. In any case, it impresses the interviewer and it shows that the interviewee is willing to learn more about the company.

Most interviewees also find that practising answering the most common questions asked in interviews helps them prepare for the real one. It minimizes the chance of their being caught off-guard regarding certain questions, prepares their minds to convey the right information in the hopes of impressing the interviewer, and also makes sure that they do not accidentally say something that might not be suitable in an interview situation.

Interviewees are generally dressed properly in [[business attire]] for the interview, so as to look [[professional]] in the eyes of the interviewer. They also bring their [[résumé]], [[cover letter]] and [[references]] to the interview to supply the interviewer the information they need, and to also cover them in case they forgot to bring any of the papers. Items like [[cellphone]]s, a cup of [[coffee]] and [[chewing gum]] are not recommended to bring to an interview, as it can lead to the interviewer perceiving the interviewee as unprofessional and in some cases, even [[rude]].

Above all, interviewees should be [[confident]] and courteous to the interviewer, as they are taking their time off work to participate in the interview. An interview is often the first time an interviewer looks at the interviewee first hand, so it is important to make a good first impression.&lt;ref&gt;http://jobsearch.about.com/od/interviewsnetworking/ss/job-interview_1.htm - accessed September 18, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nonverbal behaviors===
It may not only be what you say in an interview that matters, but also how you say it (e.g., how fast you speak) and how you behave during the interview (e.g., hand gestures, eye contact). In other words, although applicants’ responses to interview questions influence interview ratings,&lt;ref name=&quot;Hollandsworth 1979&quot;&gt;Hollandsworth, Jr., J. G. (1979).  Relative contributions of verbal, articulate, and nonverbal communication to employment decisions in the job interview setting.  Personnel Psychology, 32, 359–367.&lt;/ref&gt;  their nonverbal behaviors may also affect interviewer judgments.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;Burnett, J. R., Motowildo, S. J. (1998).  Relations between different sources of information in the structured selection interview.  Personnel Psychology, 51, 963–983.&lt;/ref&gt;  Nonverbal behaviors can be divided into two main categories: vocal cues (e.g., articulation, pitch, fluency, frequency of pauses, speed, etc.) and visual cues (e.g., smiling, eye contact, body orientation and lean, hand movement, posture, etc.).&lt;ref name=&quot;DeGroot, T. 1999&quot;&gt;DeGroot, T., &amp; Motowildo, S. J. (1999).  Why visual and vocal cues can affect interviewers’ judgments and predict job performance.  Journal of Applied Psychology, 84(6), 986–993.&lt;/ref&gt; Oftentimes physical attractiveness is included as part of nonverbal behavior as well.&lt;ref name=&quot;DeGroot, T. 1999&quot;/&gt;  There is some debate about how large a role nonverbal behaviors may play in the interview.  Some researchers maintain that nonverbal behaviors affect interview ratings a great deal,&lt;ref name=&quot;Hollandsworth 1979&quot;/&gt; while others have found that they have a relatively small impact on interview outcomes,  especially when considered with applicant qualifications presented in résumés.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rasmussen 1984&quot;&gt;Rasmussen, Jr., K. G.  (1984)  Nonverbal behavior, verbal behavior, résumé credentials, and selection interview outcomes.  Journal of Applied Psychology, 69(4), 551–556.&lt;/ref&gt; The relationship between nonverbal behavior and interview outcomes is also stronger in structured interviews than unstructured,&lt;ref&gt;Barrick, M. R., Shaffer, J. A., &amp; DeGrassi, S. W. (2009).  What you see may not be what you get: Relationship among self-presentation tactics and ratings of interview and job performance.  Journal of Applied Psychology, 94(6), 1394–1411.&lt;/ref&gt; and stronger when interviewees’ answers are of high quality.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rasmussen 1984&quot;/&gt;

Applicants’ nonverbal behaviors may influence interview ratings through the inferences interviewers make about the applicant based on their behavior.  For instance, applicants who engage in positive nonverbal behaviors such as smiling and leaning forward are perceived as more likable, trustworthy, credible,&lt;ref name=&quot;DeGroot, T. 1999&quot;/&gt; warmer, successful, qualified, motivated, competent,&lt;ref name=&quot;Imada, A. S. 1977&quot;&gt;Imada, A. S., &amp; Hakel, M. D.  (1977).  Influence of nonverbal communication and rater proximity on impressions and decisions in simulated employment interviews.  Journal of Applied Psychology, 62(3), 295–300.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[socially skilled|social skills]].&lt;ref&gt;Gilfford, R., Ng, C. F., &amp; Wilkinson, M. (1985).  Nonverbal cues in the employment interview:  Links between applicant qualities and interview judgments.  Journal of Applied Psychology, 70(4), 729–736.&lt;/ref&gt; These applicants are also predicted to be better accepted and more satisfied with the organization if hired.&lt;ref name=&quot;Imada, A. S. 1977&quot;/&gt;

Applicants’ verbal responses and their nonverbal behavior may convey some of the same information about the applicant.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt;  However, despite any shared information between content and nonverbal behavior, it is clear that nonverbal behaviors do predict interview ratings to an extent beyond the content of what was said, and thus it is essential that applicants and interviewers alike are aware of their impact. You may want to be careful of what you may be communicating through the nonverbal behaviors you display.

===Physical attractiveness===
To hire the best applicants for the job, interviewers form judgments, sometimes using applicants’ physical attractiveness. That is, physical attractiveness is usually not necessarily related to how well one can do the job, yet has been found to influence interviewer evaluations and judgments about how suitable an applicant is for the job. Once individuals are categorized as attractive or unattractive, interviewers may have expectations about physically attractive and physically unattractive individuals and then judge applicants based on how well they fit those expectations.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hosoda, M. 2003&quot;&gt;Hosoda, M., Stone-Romero, E. F., &amp; Coats, G. (2003). The effects of physical attractiveness on job-related outcomes: A meta-analysis of experimental studies. Personnel Psychology, 56(2), 431–462.&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, it typically turns out that interviewers will judge attractive individuals more favorably on job-related factors than they judge unattractive individuals.
People generally agree on who is and who is not attractive and attractive individuals are judged and treated more positively than unattractive individuals.&lt;ref&gt;Langlois, J. H., Kalakanis, L., Rubenstein, A. J., Larson, A., Hallam, M., &amp; Smoot, M. (2000). Maxims or myths of beauty? A meta-analytic and theoretical review. Psychological Bulletin, 126(3), 390–423.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, people who think another is physically attractive tend to have positive initial impressions of that person (even before formally meeting them), perceive the person to be smart, socially competent, and have good social skills and general mental health.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hosoda, M. 2003&quot;/&gt;

Within the business domain, physically attractive individuals have been shown to have an advantage over unattractive individuals in numerous ways, that include, but are not limited to, perceived job qualifications, hiring recommendations, predicted job success, and compensation levels.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hosoda, M. 2003&quot;/&gt; As noted by several researchers, attractiveness may not be the most influential determinant of personnel decisions, but may be a deciding factor when applicants possess similar levels of qualifications.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hosoda, M. 2003&quot;/&gt; In addition, attractiveness does not provide an advantage if the applicants in the pool are of high quality, but it does provide an advantage in increased hiring rates and more positive job-related outcomes for attractive individuals when applicant quality is low and average.&lt;ref&gt;Watkins, L. M., &amp; Johnston, L. (2000). Screening job applicants: The impact of physical attractiveness and application quality. International Journal of Selection and Assessment, 8(2), 76–84.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Vocal Attractiveness'''
Just as physical attractiveness is a visual cue, vocal attractiveness is an auditory cue and can lead to differing interviewer evaluations in the interview as well. Vocal attractiveness, defined as an appealing mix of speech rate, loudness, pitch, and variability, has been found to be favorably related to interview ratings and job performance.&lt;ref name=&quot;DeGroot, T. 2007&quot;&gt;DeGroot, T., &amp; Kluemper, D. (2007). Evidence of Predictive and Incremental Validity of Personality Factors, Vocal Attractiveness and the Situational Interview. International Journal of Selection and Assessment, 15(1), 30–39.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;DeGroot, T., &amp; Motowidlo, S. J. (1999). Why visual and vocal interview cues can affect interviewers' judgments and predict job performance. Journal of Applied Psychology, 84(6), 986–993.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the personality traits of agreeableness and conscientiousness predict performance more strongly for people with more attractive voices compared to those with less attractive voices.&lt;ref name=&quot;DeGroot, T. 2007&quot;/&gt;

As important as it is to understand how physical attractiveness can influence the judgments, behaviors, and final decisions of interviewers, it is equally important to find ways to decrease potential bias in the job interview. Conducting an interview with elements of structure is a one possible way to decrease bias.&lt;ref&gt;Kutcher, E. J., &amp; Bragger, J. (2004). Selection Interviews of Overweight Job Applicants: Can Structure Reduce the Bias?. Journal of Applied Social Psychology, 34(10), 1993–2022.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Coaching===
An abundance of information is available to instruct interviewees on strategies for improving their performance in a job interview. Information used by interviewees comes from a variety of sources ranging from popular how-to books to formal coaching programs, sometimes even provided by the hiring organization. Within the more formal coaching programs, there are two general types of coaching. One type of coaching is designed to teach interviewees how to perform better in the interview by focusing on how to behave and present oneself. This type of coaching is focused on improving aspects of the interview that are not necessarily related to the specific elements of performing the job tasks. This type of coaching could include how to dress, how to display nonverbal behaviors (head nods, smiling, eye contact), verbal cues (how fast to speak, speech volume, articulation, pitch), and impression management tactics. Another type of coaching is designed to focus interviewees on the content specifically relevant to describing one’s qualifications for the job, in order to help improve their answers to interview questions. This coaching, therefore, focuses on improving the interviewee’s understanding of the skills, abilities, and traits the interviewer is attempting to assess, and responding with relevant experience that demonstrates these skills.&lt;ref name=&quot;Maurer, T. 2008&quot;&gt;Maurer, T., Solamon, J., &amp; Lippstreu, M. (2008). How does coaching interviewees affect the validity of a structured interview? Journal of Occupational Behavior, 29, 355–371.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, this type of coaching might teach an interviewee to use the STAR approach for answering behavioral interview questions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mfgjobs.com/articles/how-to-answer-behavioral-interview-questions/ How To Answer Behavioral Interview Questions - MFGJobs.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

A coaching program might include several sections focusing on various aspects of the interview. It could include a section designed to introduce interviewees to the interview process, and explain how this process works (e.g., administration of interview, interview day logistics, different types of interviews, advantages of structured interviews). It could also include a section designed to provide feedback to help the interviewee to improve their performance in the interview, as well as a section involving practice answering example interview questions. An additional section providing general interview tips about how to behave and present oneself could also be included.&lt;ref name=&quot;Maurer, T. 2006&quot;&gt;Maurer, T. &amp; Solamon, J. (2006). The science and practice of a structured employment interview coaching program. Personnel Psychology, 59, 431–454.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is useful to consider coaching in the context of the competing goals of the interviewer and interviewee.  The interviewee’s goal is typically to perform well (i.e. obtain high interview ratings), in order to get hired. On the other hand, the interviewer’s goal is to obtain job-relevant information, in order to determine whether the applicant has the skills, abilities, and traits believed by the organization to be indicators of successful job performance.&lt;ref name=&quot;Maurer, T. 2008&quot;/&gt; Research has shown that how well an applicant does in the interview can be enhanced with coaching.&lt;ref name=&quot;Maurer, T. 2008&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Campion, M. &amp; Campion, J. (1987). Evaluation of an interviewee skills training program in a natural field experiment. Personnel Psychology, 40, 675–691.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Maurer, T., Solamon, J., Andrews, K., &amp; Troxtel, D. (2001). Interviewee coaching, preparation strategies and response strategies in relation to performance in situational employment interviews: An extension of Maurer, Solamon &amp; Troxtel (1998). Journal of Applied Psychology, 86, 709–717.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Maurer, T., Solamon, J., &amp; Troxtel, D. (1998). Relationship of coaching with performance in situational employment interviews. Journal of Applied Psychology, 83, 128–136.&lt;/ref&gt; The effectiveness of coaching is due, in part, to increasing the interviewee’s knowledge, which in turn results in better interview performance. Interviewee knowledge refers to knowledge about the interview, such as the types of questions that will be asked, and the content that the interviewer is attempting to assess.&lt;ref&gt;Tross, S. &amp; Maurer, T. (2008). The effect of coaching interviewees on subsequent interview performance in structure experience-based interviews. Journal of Occupational and Organizational Psychology, 81, 589–605.&lt;/ref&gt; Research has also shown that coaching can increase the likelihood that interviewers using a structured interview will accurately choose those individuals who will ultimately be most successful on the job (i.e., increase reliability and validity of the structured interview).&lt;ref name=&quot;Maurer, T. 2008&quot;/&gt; Additionally, research has shown that interviewees tend to have positive reactions to coaching, which is often an underlying goal of an interview.&lt;ref name=&quot;Maurer, T. 2006&quot;/&gt; Based on research thus far, the effects of coaching tend to be positive for both interviewees and interviewers.

===Faking===
Interviewers should be aware that applicants can intentionally distort their responses or fake during the interview and such applicant faking has the potential to influence interview outcomes if present. Two concepts that relate to faking include social desirability (the tendency for people to present themselves in a favorable light&lt;ref&gt;Edwards, A.L. (1957). The social desirability variable in personality assessment and research. Ft. Worth, TX: Dryden Press.&lt;/ref&gt;), and [[impression management]] (conscious or unconscious attempts to influence one’s image during interactions&lt;ref&gt;Ellis, A.P.J., West, B.J., Ryan, A.M., &amp; DeShon, R.P (2002). The use of impression management tactics in structured interviews: A function of question type? Journal of Applied Psychology, 87, 1200–1208.&lt;/ref&gt;). Faking in the employment interview, then, can be defined as &quot;deceptive impression management or the conscious distortion of answers to the interview questions in order to obtain a better score on the interview and/or otherwise create favorable perceptions&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Levashina, J. 2007&quot;&gt;Levashina, J. &amp; Campion, M.A. (2007). Measuring faking in the employment interview: Development and validation of an Interview Faking Behavior Scale. Journal of Applied Psychology, 92, 1638–1656.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, faking in the employment interview is intentional, deceptive, and aimed at improving perceptions of performance.

Faking in the employment interview can be broken down into four elements.&lt;ref name=&quot;Levashina, J. 2007&quot;/&gt;  The first involves the interviewee portraying him or herself as an ideal job candidate by exaggerating true skills, tailoring answers to better fit the job, and/or creating the impression that personal beliefs, values, and attitudes are similar to those of the organization.

The second aspect of faking is inventing or completely fabricating one’s image by piecing distinct work experiences together to create better answers, inventing untrue experiences or skills, and portraying others’ experiences or accomplishments as ones’ own.

Thirdly, faking might also be aimed at protecting the applicant’s image.  This can be accomplished through omitting certain negative experiences, concealing negatively perceived aspects of the applicant’s background, and by separating oneself from negative experiences.

The fourth and final component of faking involves [[ingratiating]] oneself to the interviewer by conforming personal opinions to align with those of the organization, as well as insincerely praising or complimenting the interviewer or organization.

Of all of the various faking behaviors listed, ingratiation tactics were found to be the most prevalent in the employment interview, while flat out making up answers or claiming others’ experiences as one’s own is the least common.&lt;ref name=&quot;Levashina, J. 2007&quot;/&gt; However, fabricating true skills appears to be at least somewhat prevalent in employment interviews. One study found that over 80% of participants lied about job-related skills in the interview,&lt;ref&gt;Weiss, B. &amp; Feldman, R.S. (2006). Looking good and lying to do it: Deception as an impression management strategy in job interviews. Journal of Applied Social Psychology, 36, 1070–1086.&lt;/ref&gt; presumably to compensate for a lack of job-required skills/traits and further their chances for employment.

Most importantly, faking behaviors have been shown to affect outcomes of employment interviews. For example, the probability of getting another interview or job offer increases when interviewees make up answers.&lt;ref name=&quot;Levashina, J. 2007&quot;/&gt;

Different interview characteristics also seem to impact the likelihood of faking.  Faking behavior is less prevalent, for instance, in past behavioral interviews than in situational interviews, although follow-up questions increased faking behaviors in both types of interviews. Therefore, if practitioners are interested in decreasing faking behaviors among job candidates in employment interview settings, they should utilize structured, past behavioral interviews and avoid the use of probes or follow-up questions.&lt;ref name=&quot;Levashina, J. 2007&quot;/&gt;

===Narcissism===
{{Main|Narcissism in the workplace}}
[[Narcissists]] typically perform well at job interviews and have a good success rate for landing jobs. Interviews are one of the few social situations where narcissistic behaviours such as [[boasting]] actually create a positive impression.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/howaboutthat/10902856/Narcissists-perform-best-in-job-interviews-according-to-study.html 'Narcissists' perform best in job interviews according to study] [[Daily Telegraph]] Lucy Kinder 16 Jun 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

===Psychopathy===
{{Main|Psychopathy in the workplace}}
{{See also|Superficial charm}}
Corporate [[psychopaths]] are readily recruited into organisations because they make a distinctly positive impression at interviews.&lt;ref&gt;Cleckley H [[The Mask of Sanity]] (1988)&lt;/ref&gt; They appear to be alert, friendly and easy to get along with and talk to. They
look like they are of good ability, emotionally well adjusted and reasonable, and these traits make them attractive to those in charge of hiring staff within organisations. Other researchers confirm that psychopaths can present themselves as likeable and personally attractive.&lt;ref&gt;Mahaffey, K. J. &amp; Marcus, D. K. 2006, ‘Interpersonal Perception of Psychopathy:A Social Relations Analysis’,Journal of Social and Clinical Psychology
, vol. 25, no. 1, pp. 53–74.&lt;/ref&gt; Companies often rely on interview performance alone and do not conduct other checks such as taking references. Being accomplished [[Pathological lying|liars]] helps psychopaths obtain the jobs they want.&lt;ref&gt;Kirkman, C. A. (2005). From soap opera to science: Towards gaining access to the psychopaths who live amongst us.Psychology and Psychotherapy: Theory, Research and Practice, 78(3), 379-396.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Factors impacting on interview effectiveness==

===Validity and predictive power===
There is extant data which puts into question the value of job interviews as a tool for selecting employees. Where the aim of a job interview is ostensibly to choose a candidate who will perform well in the job role, other methods of selection provide greater predictive power and often lower costs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | url = http://www.people.vcu.edu/~mamcdani/Publications/McDaniel%20et%20al%201994%20JAP%20Validity%20of%20interviews.pdf | title = The Validity of Employment Interviews: A Comprehensive Review and Meta-Analysis| first = Michael A. |last = McDaniel | first2 = Deborah L. last2 = Whetzel | first3 = Frank L. |last3 = Schmidt | first4 = Steven D. |last4 = Maurer | year = 1994 | journal = Journal of Applied Psychology | publisher = American Psychological Association, Inc. | volume = 79 | issue = 4 | pages= 599–616 | doi=10.1037/0021-9010.79.4.599}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Interview structure issues====
While unstructured interviews are commonly used, structured interviews have yielded much better results and are considered a best practice.&lt;ref&gt;Huffcutt, A. I. (2010). From science to practice: Seven principles for conducting employment interviews. Applied H.R.M. Research, 12, 121–136&lt;/ref&gt;  Interview structure is defined as &quot;the reduction in procedural variance across applicants, which can translate into the degree of discretion that an interviewer is allowed in conducting the interview&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Huffcutt, A. I. 1994&quot;&gt;Huffcutt, A. I., &amp; Arthur, W. Jr. (1994). Hunter &amp; Hunter revisited: Interview validity for entry-level jobs. Journal of Applied Psychology, 79, 184–190&lt;/ref&gt;  Structure in an interview can be compared to a typical paper and pencil test: we would not think it was fair if every test taker was given different questions and a different number of questions on an exam, or if their answers were each graded differently.  Yet this is exactly what occurs in an unstructured interview; thus, a structured interview attempts to standardize this popular selection tool.  While there is debate surrounding what is meant specifically by a structured interview,&lt;ref name=&quot;Macan, T. 2009&quot;&gt;Macan, T. (2009). The employment interview: A review of current studies and directions for future research. Human Resource Management Review, 19, 203–218&lt;/ref&gt; there are typically two broad categories of standardization: 1) content structure, and 2) evaluation structure.&lt;ref&gt;Campion, M. A., Palmer, D. A., Campion, J. E. (1997). A review of structure in the selection interview. Personnel Psychology, 50, 655–702&lt;/ref&gt;  Content structure includes elements that refer to the actual content of the interview:
* Base questions on attributes that are representative of the job, as indicated by a [[job analysis]]
* Ask the same questions of all interviewees
* Limit prompting, or follow up questions, that interviewers may ask
* Ask better questions, such as behavioral description questions
* Have a longer interview
* Control ancillary information available to the interviewees, such as resumes
* Don’t allow questions from applicants during interview
Evaluation structure includes aspects that refer to the actual rating of the interviewee:
* Rate each answer rather than making an overall evaluation at the end of the interview
* Use anchored rating scales (for an example, see BARS )
* Have the interviewer take detailed notes
* Have more than one interviewer view each applicant (i.e. have panel interviews)
* Have the same interviewers rate each applicant
* Don’t allow any discussion about the applicants between interviewers
* Train the interviewers
* Use statistical procedures to create an overall interview score
It is important to note that structure should be thought of as a continuum; that is, the degree of structure present in an interview can vary along these various elements listed above.&lt;ref name=&quot;Macan, T. 2009&quot;/&gt;

====Interviewer rating reliability====
In terms of reliability, meta-analytic results provided evidence that interviews can have acceptable levels of interrater reliability, or consistent ratings across interviewers [[interrater reliability]] (i.e. .75 or above), when a structured panel interview is used.&lt;ref&gt;Conway, J. M., Jako, R. A., &amp; Goodman, D. F. (1995). A meta-analysis of interrater and internal consistency reliability of selection interviews. Journal of Applied Psychology, 80, 565–579&lt;/ref&gt;  In terms of criterion-related validity, or how well the interview predicts later job performance [[criterion validity]], meta-analytic results have shown that when compared to unstructured interviews, structured interviews have higher validities, with values ranging from .20-.57 (on a scale from 0 to 1), with validity coefficients increasing with higher degrees of structure.&lt;ref name=&quot;Huffcutt, A. I. 1994&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wiesner, W. H., &amp; Cronshaw, S. F. (1988). The moderating impact of interview format &amp; degree of structure on interview validity. Journal of Occupational Psychology, 61, 275–290&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McDaniel, M. A., Whetzel, D. L., Schmidt, F. L., &amp; Maurer, S. (1994). The validity of employment interviews: A comprehensive review and meta-analysis. Journal of Applied Psychology, 79, 599–617&lt;/ref&gt;  That is, as the degree of structure in an interview increases, the more likely interviewers can successfully predict how well the person will do on the job, especially when compared to unstructured interviews.  In fact, one structured interview that included a) a predetermined set of questions that interviewers were able to choose from, and b) interviewer scoring of applicant answers after each individual question using previously created benchmark answers, showed validity levels comparable to cognitive ability tests (traditionally one of the best predictors of job performance) for entry level jobs.&lt;ref name=&quot;Huffcutt, A. I. 1994&quot;/&gt;

Honesty and integrity are attributes that can be very hard to determine using a formal job interview process: the competitive environment of the job interview may in fact promote dishonesty. Some experts on job interviews express a degree of cynicism towards the process. {{Who|date=November 2009}}

===Applicant reactions===
Applicant reactions to the interview process include specific factors such as; fairness, emotional responses, and attitudes toward the interviewer or the organization.&lt;ref&gt;König, C. J., Klehe, U. C., Berchtold, M., &amp; Kleinmann, M. (2010). Reasons for being selective when choosing personnel selection procedures. International Journal of Selection and Assessment, 18(1), 17-27.&lt;/ref&gt; Though the applicant's perception of the interview process may not influence the interviewer(s) ability to distinguish between individuals' suitability, applicants reactions are important as those who react negatively to the selection process are more likely to withdraw from the selection process.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hausknecht&quot;&gt;Hausknecht, J. P., Day, D. V., &amp; Thomas, S. C. (2004). Applicant reactions to selection procedures: An updated model and meta‐analysis.

International Journal of Selection and Assessment, 18(3), 291-304.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Interview design====
Interview design can influence applicants' positive and negative reactions, though research findings on applicants preferences for structured compared to unstructured interviews appear contradictory.&lt;ref name=&quot;Chapman&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chapman, D. S., &amp; Rowe, P. M. (2002). The influence of videoconference technology and interview structure on the recruiting function of the employment interview: A field experiment.

L., &amp; Carroll, S. A. (2003). Situational and patterned behavior description interviews: A comparison of their validity, correlates, and perceived fairness. Human Performance, 16(1), 25-47.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Types of questions====
The type of questions asked can affect applicant reactions. General questions are viewed more positively than situational or behavioral questions&lt;ref&gt;Conway, J. M., &amp; Peneno, G. M. (1999). Comparing structured interview question types: Construct validity and applicant reactions. Journal of Business and Psychology, 13(4), 485-506.&lt;/ref&gt; and 'puzzle' interview questions may be perceived as negative being perceived unrelated to the job, unfair, or unclear how to answer.&lt;ref&gt;Wright, C. W., Sablynski, C. J., Manson, T. M., &amp; Oshiro, S. (2012). Why Are Manhole 
Covers Round? A Laboratory Study of Reactions to Puzzle Interviews.

M., &amp; McCarthy, J. M. (2006). Effects of discriminatory interview questions and gender on applicant reactions. Journal of Business and Psychology, 21(2), 175-191.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Additional factors====
The 'friendliness' of the interviewer may be equated to fairness of the process and improve the liklihood of accepting a job offer,&lt;ref&gt;Chapman, D., &amp; Webster, J. (2006). Toward an integrated model of applicant reactions and job choice. The International Journal of Human Resource Management, 17(6), 1032-1057.&lt;/ref&gt; and face-to-face interviews compared to video conferencing and telephone interviews.&lt;ref&gt;Chapman, D.

Journal of Applied Psychology, 88(5), 944.&lt;/ref&gt; In video conferencing interviews the perception of the interviewer may be viewed as less personable, trustworthy, and competent.&lt;ref&gt;Sears, G., Zhang, H., H. Wiesner, W., D. Hackett, R., &amp; Yuan, Y. (2013). A comparative assessment of videoconference and face-to-face employment interviews. Management Decision, 51(8), 1733-1752.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Interview anxiety===
Interview anxiety refers to experiencing unpleasant or distressing feelings before or during a job interview.&lt;ref name=&quot;McCarthy, J. 2004&quot;&gt;McCarthy, J., &amp; Goffin, R. (2004). Measuring job interview anxiety: Beyond weak knees and sweaty palms. Personnel Psychology, 57(3), 607-637&lt;/ref&gt; It also reflects feeling apprehensive or tense about participating in an interview.&lt;ref&gt;Tross, S. A., &amp; Maurer, T. J. (2008). The effect of coaching interviewees on subsequent interview performance in structured experience‐based interviews. Journal of Occupational and Organizational Psychology, 81(4), 589-605&lt;/ref&gt; A couple of reasons why job candidates feel a heightened sense of anxiety and nervousness about the employment interview is because they feel they have little to no control over the interview process &lt;ref&gt;Jones, D. B., &amp; Pinkney, J. W. (1989). An Exploratory Assessment of the Sources of Job-Interviewing Anxiety in College Students. Journal of College Student Development, 30(6), 553-60&lt;/ref&gt; or because they have to speak with a stranger.&lt;ref&gt;Ayres, J., Keereetaweep, T., Chen, P. E., &amp; Edwards, P. A. (1998). Communication apprehension and employment interviews. Communication Education, 47, 1-17&lt;/ref&gt;

====Implications for applicants====
Whether anxieties come from how someone is as a person or from the interview situation itself, these anxious feelings have important consequences for job candidates, such as; limiting an applicant from effectively showing their ability to communicate and their future potential,&lt;ref&gt;Posner, B. Z. (1981). Comparing recruiter, student, and faculty perceptions of important applicant and job characteristics. Personnel Psychology, 34(2), 329-339&lt;/ref&gt;  reducing interview performance and consequent assessment despite potential suitability for the job,&lt;ref name=&quot;McCarthy, J. 2004&quot;/&gt; reducing likelihood of a second interview compared to less anxious individuals.&lt;ref&gt;Cook, K.W., Vance, C.A. and Spector, P.E. (2000). The relation of candidate personality with selection-interview outcomes. Journal of Applied Social Psychology, 30, 867–885&lt;/ref&gt;

====Implications for organizations====
Applicants who view the selection process more favorably tend to be more positive about the organization, and are likely to influence an organization’s reputation.&lt;ref name=&quot;McCarthy, J. 2004&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Macan, T. H., Avedon, M. J., Paese, M., &amp; Smith, D. E. (1994). The effects of applicants' reactions to cognitive ability tests and an assessment center. Personnel Psychology, 47(4), 715-738&lt;/ref&gt; whearas, in contrast, anxious or uncomfortable during their interview may view an organization less favorably, causing the otherwise qualified candidates not accepting a job offer.&lt;ref name=&quot;McCarthy, J. 2004&quot;/&gt; If an applicant is nervous, they might not act the same way they would on the job, making it harder for organizations to use the interview for predicting someone’s future job performance.&lt;ref name=&quot;McCarthy, J. 2004&quot;/&gt;

==Legal issues ==
In many countries laws are put into place to prevent organizations from engaging in discriminatory practices against protected classes when selecting individuals for jobs.&lt;ref&gt;This is not meant to be a complete explanation of employment law or should it be construed as legal advice.  This merely attempts to explain certain laws that are applicable to the employment interview. Please seek legal counsel before taking action based on the content of this information.&lt;/ref&gt;  In the United States, it is unlawful for private employers with 15 or more employees along with state and local government employers to discriminate against applicants based on the following: race, color, sex (including pregnancy), national origin, age (40 or over), disability, or genetic information (note:  additional classes may be protected depending on state or local law). More specifically, an employer cannot legally &quot;fail or refuse to hire or to discharge any individual, or otherwise discriminate against any individual with respect to his compensation, terms, conditions, or privilege of employment&quot; or &quot;to limit, segregate, or classify his employees or applicants for employment in any way which would deprive or tend to deprive any individual of employment opportunities or otherwise adversely affect his status as an employee.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Myors, B., Lievens, F., Schollaert, E., Van Hoye, G., Cronshaw, S.F., Mladinic, A., Rodriguez, V., Aguinis, H., Steiner, D.D., Rolland, F., Schuler, H., Frintrup, A., Nikolaou, I., Tomprou, M., Subramony, S., Ray, S.B., Tzafrir, S., Bamberger, P., Bertolino, M., Mariani, M., Fraccaroli, F., Sekiguchi, T., Onyura, B., Yand, H., Anderson, N., Evers, A., Chernyshenko, O., Englert, P., Kriek, H.J., Joubert, T., Salgado, J.F., Konig, C.J., Thommen, L.A., Chaung, A., Sinangil, H.K., Bayazit, M., Cook, M., Shen, W., &amp; Sackett, P. (2008). International perspectives on the legal environment for selection. Industrial and Organizational Psychology: Perspectives on Science and Practice, 1, 206–246.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964; Equal employment Opportunity Commission (www.eeoc.gov)&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]] and [[Civil Rights Act of 1991|1991]] (Title VII)  were passed into law to prevent the discrimination of individuals due to race, color, religion, sex, or national origin.  The Pregnancy Discrimination Act was added as an amendment and protects women if they are pregnant or have a pregnancy-related condition.&lt;ref name=&quot;EEOC&quot;&gt;Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (www.eeoc.gov)&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Age Discrimination in Employment Act]] of 1967 prohibits discriminatory practice directed against individuals who are 40 years of age and older.  Although some states (e.g. New York) do have laws preventing the discrimination of individuals younger than 40, no federal law exists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=New York State Human Rights Law (Executive Law, Article 15) |url= http://www.dhr.state.ny.us/doc/hrl.pdf |format=PDF |publisher=Dhr.state.ny.us}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990]] protects qualified individuals who currently have or in the past have had a physical or mental disability (current users of illegal drugs are not covered under this Act).  A person is a cripple if he has a disability that substantially limits a major life activity, has a history of a disability, is regarded by others as being disabled, or has a physical or mental impairment that is not transitory (lasting or expected to last six months or less) and minor.  In order to be covered under this Act, the individual must be qualified for the job.  A qualified individual is &quot;an individual with a disability who, with or without reasonable accommodation, can perform the essential functions of the employment position that such individual holds or desires.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;disability&quot;&gt;Americans with Disability Act; Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (www.eeoc.gov)&lt;/ref&gt;  Unless the disability poses an &quot;undue hardship,&quot; reasonable accommodations must be made by the organization.  &quot;In general, an accommodation is any change in the work environment or in the way things are customarily done that enables an individual with a disability to enjoy equal employment opportunities.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;disability&quot; /&gt; Examples of reasonable accommodations are changing the workspace of an individual in a wheelchair to make it more wheelchair accessible, modifying work schedules, and/or modifying equipment.&lt;ref&gt;DeLeire, T. (2000).  The wage and employment effects of the Americans with Disabilities Act.  The Journal of Human Resources, 35(4),  693–715.&lt;/ref&gt;  Employees are responsible for asking for accommodations to be made by their employer.&lt;ref name=&quot;EEOC&quot;/&gt;

The most recent law to be passed is Title II of the [[Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act]] of 2008.  In essence, this law prohibits the discrimination of employees or applicants due to an individual’s genetic information and family medical history information.

In rare circumstances, it is lawful for employers to base hiring decisions on protected class information if it is considered a [[Bona Fide Occupational Qualification]], that is, if it is a &quot;qualification reasonably necessary to the normal operation of the particular business.&quot;  For example, a movie studio may base a hiring decision on age if the actor they are hiring will play a youthful character in a film.&lt;ref&gt;Arvey, R. D., &amp; Faley, R. H. (1988).  Fairness in Selecting Employees.  Reading, Massachusetts:  Addison-Wesley Publishing Company.&lt;/ref&gt;

Given these laws, organizations are limited in the types of questions they legally are allowed to ask applicants in a job interview.  Asking these questions may cause discrimination against protected classes, unless the information is considered a Bona Fide Occupational Qualification.  For example, in the majority of situations it is illegal to ask the following questions in an interview as a condition of employment:
  
* What is your date of birth?&lt;ref name=&quot;legal1&quot;&gt;Saks, A. M., &amp; McCarthy, J. M. (2006).  Effects of discriminatory interview questions and gender on applicant reactions.  Journal of Business and Psychology, 21(2). {{doi|10.1007/s10869-006-9024-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Have you ever been arrested for a crime?&lt;ref name=&quot;legal1&quot; /&gt;
* Do you have any future plans for marriage and children?&lt;ref name=&quot;legal1&quot; /&gt;
* What are your spiritual beliefs?&lt;ref name=&quot;legal2&quot;&gt;US Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (www.eeoc.gov)&lt;/ref&gt;
* How many days were you sick last year? Have you ever been treated for mental health problems?&lt;ref name=&quot;legal2&quot; /&gt;
* What prescription drugs are you currently taking?&lt;ref name=&quot;legal2&quot; /&gt;

=== Applicants with disabilities ===
Applicants with disabilities may be concerned with the effect that their disability has on both interview and employment outcomes.  Research has concentrated on four key issues: how interviewers rate applicants with disabilities, the reactions of applicants with disabilities to the interview, the effects of disclosing a disability during the interview, and the perceptions different kinds of applicant disabilities may have on interviewer ratings.

The job interview is a tool used to measure constructs or overall characteristics that are relevant for the job.  Oftentimes, applicants will receive a score based on their performance during the interview. Research has found different findings based on interviewers’ perceptions of the disability.  For example, some research has found a leniency effect (i.e., applicants with disabilities receive higher ratings than equally qualified non-disabled applicants) in ratings of applicants with disabilities&lt;ref&gt;Breecher, E., Bragger, J., &amp; Kutcher, E. (2006). The structured interview: Reducing biases toward job applicants with physical disabilities. Employee Responsibilities and Rights Journal, 18, 155–170.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Nordstrom&quot;&gt;Nordstrom, C. R., Huffaker, B. J., &amp; Williams, K. B. (1998). When physical disabilities are not liabilities: The role of applicant and interviewer characteristics on employment interview outcomes. Journal of Applied Social Psychology, 28, 283–306&lt;/ref&gt;  Other research, however, has found there is a disconnect between the interview score and the hiring recommendation for applicants with disabilities.  That is, even though applicants with disabilities may have received a high interview score, they are still not recommended for employment.&lt;ref&gt;Macan, T. H., &amp; Hayes, T. L. (1995). Both sides of the employment interview interaction: Perceptions of interviewers and applicants with disabilities. Rehabilitation Psychology, 40, 261–278&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Miceli, N. S. 2002&quot;&gt;Miceli, N. S., Harvey, M., &amp; Buckley, M. R. (2002). Potential discrimination in structured employment interviews. Employee Responsibilities and Rights Journal, 13, 15–38.&lt;/ref&gt; The difference between ratings and hiring could be detrimental to a company because they may be missing an opportunity to hire a qualified applicant.

A second issue in interview research deals with the applicants’ with disabilities reactions to the interview and applicant perceptions of the interviewers. Applicants with disabilities and able-bodied applicants report similar feelings of anxiety towards an interview.&lt;ref name=&quot;Duckett&quot;&gt;Duckett, P. S. (2000). Disabling employment interviews: Warfare to work. Disability &amp; Society, 15, 1019–1039.&lt;/ref&gt;  Applicants with disabilities often report that interviewers react nervously and insecurely, which leads such applicants to experience anxiety and tension themselves. The interview is felt to be the part of the selection process where covert discrimination against applicants with disabilities can occur.&lt;ref name=&quot;Duckett&quot;/&gt; Many applicants with disabilities feel they cannot disclose (i.e., inform potential employer of disability) or discuss their disability because they want to demonstrate their abilities. If the disability is visible, then disclosure will inevitably occur when the applicant meets the interviewer, so the applicant can decide if they want to discuss their disability.  If an applicant has a non-visible disability, however, then that applicant has more of a choice in disclosing and discussing. In addition, applicants who were aware that the recruiting employer already had employed people with disabilities felt they had a more positive interview experience.&lt;ref name=&quot;Duckett&quot;/&gt; Applicants should consider if they are comfortable with talking about and answering questions about their disability before deciding how to approach the interview.

Research has also demonstrated that different types of disabilities have different effects on interview outcomes.  Disabilities with a negative stigma and that are perceived as resulting from the actions of the person (e.g., HIV-Positive, substance abuse) result in lower interview scores than disabilities for which the causes are perceived to be out of the individual’s control (e.g., physical birth defect).&lt;ref name=&quot;Miceli, N. S. 2002&quot;/&gt; A physical disability often results in higher interviewer ratings than psychological (e.g., mental illness) or sensory conditions (e.g., Tourette Syndrome).&lt;ref name=&quot;Nordstrom&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Dalgin&quot;&gt;Dalgin, S. R., &amp; Bellini, J. (2008). Invisible disability disclosure in an employment interview: Impact on employers’ hiring decision and views of employability. Rehabilitation Counseling Bulletin, 52, 6–15.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, there are differences between the effects of disclosing disabilities that are visible (e.g., wheelchair bound) and non-visible (e.g., Epilepsy) during the interview.  When applicants had a non-visible disability and disclosed their disability early in the interview they were not rated more negatively than applicants who did not disclose. In fact, they were liked more than the applicants who did not disclose their disability and were presumed not disabled.&lt;ref&gt;Roberts, L. L., &amp; Macan, T. H. (2006). Disability disclosure effects on employment interview ratings of applicants with nonvisible disabilities. Rehabilitation Psychology, 51, 239–246. {{doi|10.1037/0090-5550.51.3.239}}&lt;/ref&gt; Interviewers tend to be impressed by the honesty of the disclosure.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dalgin&quot;/&gt; Strong caution needs to be taken with applying results from studies about specific disabilities, as these results may not apply to other types of disabilities.  Not all disabilities are the same and more research is needed to find whether these results are relevant for other types of disabilities.

Some practical implications for job interviews for applicants with disabilities include research findings that show there are no differences in interviewer responses to a brief, shorter discussion or a detailed, longer discussion about the disability during the interview.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dalgin&quot;/&gt;  Applicants, however, should note that when a non-visible disability is disclosed near the end of the interview, applicants were rated more negatively than early disclosing and non-disclosing applicants.  Therefore, it is possible that interviewers feel individuals who delay disclosure may do so out of shame or embarrassment.  In addition, if the disability is disclosed after being hired, employers may feel deceived by the new hire and reactions could be less positive than would have been in the interview.&lt;ref&gt;Stone, D. L., &amp; Colella, A. (1996). A model of factors affecting the treatment of disabled individuals in organizations. Academy of Management Review, 21, 352–401.&lt;/ref&gt;  If applicants want to disclose their disability during the interview, research shows that a disclosure and/or discussion earlier in the interview approach may afford them some positive interview effects.&lt;ref&gt;Hebl, M. R., &amp; Skorinko, J. L. (2005). Acknowledging one’s physical disability in the interview: Does &quot;when&quot; make a difference? Journal of Applied Social Psychology, 35, 2477–2492. {{doi|10.1111/j.1559-1816.2005.tb02111.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; The positive effects, however, are preceded by the interviewers perception of the applicants’ psychological well-being.  That is, when the interviewer perceives the applicant is psychologically well and/or comfortable with his or her disability, there can be positive interviewer effects.  In contrast, if the interviewer perceives the applicant as uncomfortable or anxious discussing the disability, this may either fail to garner positive effect or result in more negative interview ratings for the candidate. Caution must again be taken when applying these research findings to other types of disabilities not investigated in the studies discussed above.  There are many factors that can influence the interview of an applicant with a disability, such as whether the disability is physical or psychological, visible or non-visible, or whether the applicant is perceived as responsible for the disability or not. Therefore, applicants should make their own conclusions about how to proceed in the interview after comparing their situations with those examined in the research discussed here.

=== Other applicant discrimination: Weight and pregnancy ===

Job applicants who are underweight (to the point of emaciation), overweight or obese may face discrimination in the interview.&lt;ref name=&quot;Roehling&quot;&gt;Roehling, M. V. (1999). Weight-based discrimination in employment: Psychological and legal aspects. Personnel Psychology, 52, 969–1016.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Swami&quot;&gt;Swami, V., Chan, F., Wong, V. Furnham, A., &amp; Tovee, M. J. (2008). Weight-based discrimination in occupational hiring and helping behavior. Journal of Applied Social Psychology, 38(4), 968–981.&lt;/ref&gt; The negative treatment of overweight and obese individuals may stem from beliefs that weight is controllable and those who fail to control their weight are lazy, unmotivated, and lack self-discipline.&lt;ref name=&quot;Greenleaf&quot;&gt;Greenleaf, C., Starks, M., Gomez, L., Chambliss, H., &amp; Martin, S.

[[Image:Edward VI of England c. 1546.jpg|thumb|right|[[Edward VI of England|Edward VI]] in a red fur-lined gown with split hanging sleeves, a men's fashion of the mid-16th century]]

Despite the constant introduction of new terms by [[fashion designer]]s, clothing manufacturers, and marketers, the names for several basic garment classes in English are very stable over time.  ''Gown'', ''shirt/skirt'', ''frock'', and ''coat'' are all attested back to the early [[medieval]] period.

''Gown'' (from [[Medieval]] [[Latin]] ''gunna'') was a basic clothing term for hundreds of years, referring to a garment that hangs from the shoulders.  In [[Medieval]] and [[Renaissance]] England ''gown'' referred to a loose outer garment worn by both men and women, sometimes short, more often ankle length, with [[sleeve]]s.  By the 18th century ''gown'' had become a standard category term for a women's [[dress]], a meaning it retained until the mid-20th century.  Only in the last few decades has ''gown'' lost this general meaning in favor of ''dress''.  Today the term ''gown'' is rare except in specialized cases: [[academic dress]] or ''cap and gown'', [[evening gown]], [[nightgown]], [[hospital gown]], and so on (''see'' [[Gown]]).

''Shirt'' and ''skirt'' are originally the same word, the former being the southern and the latter the northern pronunciation in early [[Middle English]].

''Coat'' remains a term for an overgarment, its essential meaning for the last thousand years (''see'' [[Coat (clothing)|Coat]]).

== New sources ==

Names for new styles or fashions in clothing are frequently the deliberate inventions of fashion designers or clothing manufacturers; these include [[Chanel]]'s [[Little Black Dress]] (a term which has survived) and [[Lanvin (clothing)|Lanvin]]'s ''[[Robe|robe de style]]'' (which has not). Other terms are of more obscure origin.

=== Personal names ===

Clothing styles are frequently named after people—often with a military connection:

*The ''Garibaldi jacket'' or [[Garibaldi shirt]] were bright red woolen garments for women with black [[embroidery]] or braid and military details popular in the [[1860s in fashion|1860s]]; they are named after the Italian revolutionary [[Giuseppe Garibaldi]] who visited England in 1863.
*The [[Eisenhower jacket]] or &quot;Ike&quot; jacket is a waist-length, military jacket of World War II origins.  Called the &quot;Jacket, Field, Wool, M-1944&quot;, it was commissioned by then [[Dwight D. Eisenhower|General Dwight Eisenhower]] as a new field jacket for the US Forces in Northern Europe.  The jacket was based on the British Army 'Battle Dress' jacket of the same era.
*The ''[[cardigan (sweater)|cardigan]]'' is a [[knit]]ted jacket or button-front [[sweater]] created to keep British soldiers warm in Russian winters.  It is named for [[James Brudenell, 7th Earl of Cardigan]], who led the [[Charge of the Light Brigade]] in the [[Crimean War]] (1854).
*The ''[[Mao suit|Mao jacket]]'' is a very plain (often grey), high-collared, shirtlike jacket customarily worn by [[Mao Zedong]] and the people of China during his regime. Its drab design and uniformity was a reaction to pre-[[Revolution]] class distinctions of clothes, with elites dressing in elaborate silks, while poor laborers wore very rough clothes.
*The ''[[Nehru jacket]]'' is a uniform jacket without lapels or collars, popularized by [[Jawaharlal Nehru]], the first Prime Minister of independent India.
*The ''[[Bloomer Costume]]'' was a type of women's clothing introduced in the [[Antebellum era|Antebellum]] period, that changed the style from dresses to a more male-type style, which was devised by [[Amelia Bloomer]].
*The ''[[Wellington boot]]'' was a cavalry boot devised by [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|the Duke of Wellington]], originally made from leather, but now normally rubber.
*The ''[[Stetson]] hat'' is named after the founder of the [[John B. Stetson Company]].
*The ''[[Mackintosh]]'' is a waterproof coat made from [[rubber]]ised [[textile|fabric]], named after its inventor [[Charles Macintosh]].
*The ''[[Gandhi cap]]'' is a white colored sidecap made from khadi. It was popularised by Mahatma Gandhi during the Indian independence movement.

=== Place names ===

Another fertile source for clothing terms is place names, which usually reflect the origin (or supposed origin) of a fashion.  Modern terms such as Bermuda shorts, [[aloha shirt|Hawaiian shirts]], and [[Fair Isle (technique)|Fair Isle]] [[sweater]]s are the latest in a long line that stretches back to ''holland'' (linen), ''damask'' (&quot;from [[Damascus]]&quot;), ''[[polonaise (clothing)|polonaise]]'' (&quot;in the fashion of [[Poland|Polish]] women&quot;), ''[[Basque (clothing)|basque]]'', ''jersey'' (originally [[Jersey]] [[frock]]), ''[[Balaclava (clothing)|Balaclava]]'', ''[[Capri pants]]'', ''[[mantua (clothing)|mantua]]'',  and ''denim'' (&quot;serge de [[Nîmes]]&quot; after the city).

=== Costume historian's terms ===

Costume historians, with a &quot;rearward-looking&quot; view, require names for clothing styles that were not used (or needed) when the styles were actually worn. For example, the Van Dyke collar is so-called from its appearances in 17th century portraits by [[Anthony van Dyck]], and the Watteau pleats of the ''[[Sack-back gown|robe á la française]]'' are called after their appearance in the portraits of [[Antoine Watteau]].

Similarly, terms may be applied ahistorically to entire categories of garments, so that ''corset'' is applied to garments that were called ''stays'' or a ''pair of bodies'' until the introduction of the word ''corset'' in the late 18th century.  And ''dress'' is now applied to any women's garment consisting of a bodice and skirt, although for most of its history ''dress'' simply meant clothing, or a complete outfit of clothing with its appropriate accessories.

=== Short forms ===

A notable trend at the turn of the 21st century is &quot;cute&quot; short forms: [[camisole]] becomes ''cami'', hooded sweaters or [[sweatshirt]]s become ''hoodies'', and as of 2005, short or &quot;shrunken&quot; cardigans are ''cardies''.

The much-older term ''shimmy'' for &quot;slip&quot; is most likely a [[false singular]] from [[chemise]].

This list of Hindu festivals summarizes festivals observed in [[Hinduism]].

==Utsava and observance==
'''Uthsava''' or '''Utsava''' or '''Utsav''' is derived from the [[Sanskrit]] word, ''Utsava''.  The Sanskrit word ''Utsava'' comes from the word &quot;ut&quot; meaning &quot;removal&quot; and &quot;sava&quot; which means &quot;worldly sorrows&quot; or &quot;grief&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.balaji.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=120&amp;Itemid=93 Sri Venkateswara Swami Temple of Greater Chicago]&lt;/ref&gt;

A festival may be observed with acts of worship, offerings to deities, fasting, feasting, vigil, rituals, fairs, charity, celebrations, [[Puja (Hinduism)|Puja]], [[Homa (ritual)|Homa]], [[aarti]] etc.

==Observance periods (tithi)==
In the [[Hindu calendar]] dates are usually prescribed according to the [[lunar calendar]]. In [[vedic timekeeping]], a [[tithi]] is a [[lunar day]].

==Mythology==
The festivals typically celebrate events from Hindu mythology, often coinciding with seasonal changes. There are many festivals which are primarily celebrated by specific sects or in certain regions of the [[Indian subcontinent]].

||''Rama Navami'' is the celebration of the birth of [[Rama]]. Rama Navami is the day on which Lord Rama, the seventh incarnation of Lord Vishnu, incarnated in human form in the land of Ayodhya. He is the ardha ansh of Vishnu or has half the divinitive qualities of Lord Vishnu. The word “Rama” literally means one who is divinely blissful and who gives joy to others, and one in whom the sages rejoice. Ram Navami falls on the ninth day of the bright fortnight in the month of Chaitra (April/May) and coincides with Vasant Navratri or Chait Durga Puja. Therefore in some regions, the festival is spread over nine days. This day, marking the birthday of Lord Rama, is also observed as the marriage day of Rama and Sita and thus also referred to as Kalyanotsavam. In Ayodhya, the birthplace of Lord Rama, a huge fair is held with thousands of devotees gathering to celebrate this festival. The fair continues for two days, and rathyatras, carrying the Deities of Ram, his brother Laxman, His wife Sita, and His greatest devotee Mahavir Hanuman, are taken out from almost all Ram Temples. Hanuman is known for is his devotion to Rama, and his tales form an important part of the celebration. In Andhra Pradesh, Ram Navami is celebrated for 10 days from the Chaitra saptami to the Bahula Padyami that fall in the month of March and April. Temples re-enact the marriage of Lord Rama and Sita to commemorate this event, since this day is also the day they got married.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hindupedia.com/en/Rama_Navami&lt;/ref&gt;

||Eighth day of waning moon of [[Bhadrapad]] (Hindu calendar)  
|| ''Krishna Janmaashtami'' is the Hindu festival celebrating the birth of [[Krishna]]. It is actually called as Krishna Jayanthi. The date falls not only on the eight day of the waning moon of Bhadrapad, but always on Rohini Nakshatra. Janmashtami, the birthday of Lord Krishna is celebrated with great devotion and enthusiasm in India in the month of July or August. According to the Hindu calendar this religious festival is celebrated on the Ashtami of Krishna Paksh or the 8th day of the dark fortnight in the month of Bhadon. Sri Krishna is considered as the one of the most powerful human incarnations of the Lord Vishnu. He was born around 5,200 years ago in Mathura. The sole objective of Sri Krishna's birth was to free the Earth from the evilness of demons. He played an important role in Mahabharata and propagated the theory of bhakti and good karma which are narrated deeply in the Bhagwat Geeta. Sri Krishna was born in a prison in the custody of Kansa. Vasudev, His father immediately thought of his friend Nand and decided to hand over his child to him to save Krishna from the clutch of Kansa. Krishna grew up in Gokul and finally killed his uncle, King Kansa. The actual celebration of Janmashtami takes place during the midnight as Sri Krishna is believed to be born on a dark, stormy and windy night to end the rule and violence of his uncle, Kansa. All over India this day is celebrated with devotional songs and dances, pujas, arti, blowing of the Conch and rocking the cradle of baby Sri Krishna. The Janmashtami celebration of Mathura and Vrindavan, the places where Sri Krishna had spent his life, are very special. On this day temples and homes are wonderfully decorated and illuminated. Night long prayers are offered and religious mantras are sung in the temples.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.calendarlabs.com/holidays/india/janmashtami.php&lt;/ref&gt;

From Kashmir in the North to Tamil Nadu in the South, and from Gujarat in the West to Sikkim in the East, it is celebrated with great enthusiasm as the conquest of good over evil.

'''Western wear''' is a category of men's and women's [[clothing]] which derives its unique style from the clothes worn in the 19th-century [[American Old West|American West]]. It ranges from accurate historical reproductions of [[American pioneer|pioneer]], [[mountain man]], [[American Civil War|Civil War]], [[cowboy]] and [[vaquero]] clothing to the stylized garments popularized by [[singing cowboy]]s such as [[Gene Autry]] and [[Roy Rogers]] in the 1940s and '50s. Western wear can be very informal, with a [[t-shirt]] and [[Jeans|blue jeans]] forming a basic ensemble, or it may consist of tailored formal garments with western accents. At minimum, western wear generally incorporates a [[cowboy hat]], a leather [[Belt (clothing)|belt]], and [[cowboy boots]].

==Hat==
[[File:Bat Masterson 1879.jpg|thumb|150px|right|Lawman [[Bat Masterson]] wearing a bowler hat]] 
In the early days of the [[Old West]] it was the [[bowler hat]] rather than the [[slouch hat]], centercrease (derived from the army regulation [[Hardee hat]]), or [[sombrero]] that was the most popular among cowboys as it was less likely to blow out off in the wind.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | title=The Hat That Won the West | url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=336&amp;dat=19571026&amp;id=xQQpAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=PkgDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=7036,5636283 | accessdate=2010-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the 1870s, however, the [[Stetson]] had become the most popular [[cowboy hat]] due to its use by the [[Union Cavalry]] as an alternative to the regulation blue [[kepi]].&lt;ref&gt;Stetson Hats 1865–1870, Jeffery B. Snyder 1997&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;* [http://www.cavhooah.com/stetson.htm CavHooah.com – Stetson Page]&lt;/ref&gt; 

Stampede strings were installed to prevent the hat from being blown off when riding at speed. These long strings were usually made from [[leather]] or [[horsehair]]. Typically, the string was run half-way around the crown of a [[Stetson|cowboy hat]], and then through a hole on each side with its ends knotted and then secured under the chin or around the back of the head keeping the hat in place in windy conditions or when riding a horse.

The tall white [[Ten gallon hat]]s traditionally worn by movie cowboys were of little use for the historical [[gunslinger]] as they made him an easy target, hence the preference of lawmen like [[Wild Bill Hickok]], [[Wyatt Earp]] and [[Bat Masterson]] for low-crowned black hats.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nebraskahistory.org/lib-arch/research/manuscripts/family/hickok.htm Wild Bill Hickok collection] at [[Nebraska State Historical Society]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Originally part of the traditional [[Plains Indian]] costume, [[coonskin cap]]s were frequently worn by [[Mountain men]] like [[Davy Crockett]] for their warmth and durability. These were revived in the 1950s following the release of a popular Disney movie starring [[Fess Parker]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.coonskincap.com The Coonskin Cap]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/1639/1803/1600/Davy%20Crockett57.jpg Height of the Craze. 1957 Wales]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Shirt==
[[File:Flightconchords.jpg|thumb|150px|right|1950s style Western shirt with [[snap fastening]]s of the type popularised by [[singing cowboy]]s]] 
A '''Western shirt''' is a traditional item of Western Wear characterized by a stylized [[Yoke (shirt)|yoke]] on the front and on the back. It is generally constructed of [[denim]] or [[tartan]] fabric with long sleeves, and in modern form is sometimes seen with snap pockets, patches made from [[bandana]] fabric, and fringe. 

A Western [[dress shirt]] is often elaborately decorated with piping, embroidered roses and a contrasting yoke. In the 1950s these were frequently worn by movie cowboys like [[Roy Rogers]] or [[Clayton Moore]]'s [[Lone Ranger]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.westernshirts.com/mens/western-shirts Western Shirts]&lt;/ref&gt; Derived from the elaborate [[Mexico|Mexican]] [[vaquero]] costumes like the [[Guayabera]] and the battleshirts worn by many Confederate soldiers, these were worn at [[rodeos]] so the cowboy could be easily identifiable.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.puertorico.com/blog/guayaberas-fashion-statement-for-men Guayabera]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Buffalo Bill]] was known to wear them with a buckskin [[fringe jacket]] during his Wild West shows and they were fashionable for teenagers in the 1970s and late 2000s.

Another common type of Western shirt is the shield-front shirt worn by many US Cavalry troopers during the [[American Civil War]] but originally derived from a red shirt issued to prewar firefighters. The cavalry shirt was made of blue wool with yellow piping and brass buttons and was invented by the flamboyant [[George Armstrong Custer]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://shootists.websitetoolbox.com/post?id=387795 Shield front shirts]&lt;/ref&gt; In recent times this shield-front shirt was popularised by [[John Wayne]] in ''[[Fort Apache (film)|Fort Apache]]'' and was also worn by [[rockabilly]] musicians like the [[Stray Cats]].

[[File:Larry Hagman as JR.jpg|thumb|150px|left|[[Larry Hagman]] as [[J.R. Ewing]] wearing a business suit with Western detailing]]
When a jacket is required there is a wide choice available for both linedancers and [[historical re-enactors]]. These include [[frock coat]]s, [[poncho]]s popularised by [[Clint Eastwood]]'s [[Spaghetti Western]]s, short Mexican jackets with silver embroidery, [[fringe jacket]]s popular among [[outlaw country]], [[southern rock]] and 1980s [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] bands,&lt;ref&gt;1. ^ U.S. Cavalryman, 1865-1890, by Martin Pegler&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Duster coat]]s derived from originals worn in the Wild West.&lt;ref&gt;# George-Warren, Holly, and Michelle Freedman: How the West Was Worn, Harry N. Abrams (2001), ISBN 0-8109-0615-5.&lt;/ref&gt; More modern interpretations include [[leather]] [[waistcoat]]s inspired by the [[Motorcycling#Subcultures|biker subculture]] and jackets with a design imitating the [[piebald]] color of a cow. Women may wear [[bolero]] jackets derived from the Civil War era [[zouave]] uniforms, [[shawl]]s, [[denim jackets]] in a color matching their skirt or dress, or a [[fringe jacket]] like [[Annie Oakley]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.neh.gov/news/humanities/2006-05/annieoakley.html &quot;Little Miss Sure Shot&quot; - The Saga of Annie Oakley]&lt;/ref&gt;

For more formal occasions inhabitants of the West might opt for a suit with &quot;smile&quot; pockets, a half-belt at the rear, piping and a yoke similar to that on the Western shirts. This can take the form of an [[Ike jacket]], [[Leisure suit]] or three-button [[sportcoat]]. [[Country and Western]] singer [[Johnny Cash]] was known to wear an all-black Western suit, in contrast to the elaborate Nudie suits worn by stars like [[Elvis]] and [[Porter Waggoner]].&lt;ref&gt;Beard, Tyler (2001). ''100 Years of Western Wear'', p. 72. Gibbs Smith, Salt Lake City. ISBN 0-87905-591-X.&lt;/ref&gt;  The most elaborate western wear is the custom work created by [[tailor|rodeo tailors]] such as [[Nudie Cohn]] and [[Manuel Cuevas|Manuel]], which is characterized by elaborate [[embroidery]] and [[rhinestone]] decoration. (See also [[Nudie suit]].) This type of western wear, popularized by [[country music]] performers, is the origin of the phrase ''[[rhinestone cowboy]]''.

In the early days of the Wild West trousers were made out of wool. In summer canvas was sometimes used. This changed during the [[Gold Rush]] of the 1840s when [[denim]] [[overalls]] became popular among miners for their cheapness and breathability. [[Levi Strauss]] improved the design by adding [[copper]] [[rivets]]&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| url=http://patimg1.uspto.gov/.piw?docid=00139121&amp;SectionNum=1&amp;IDKey=36265F66C6AD&amp;HomeUrl=http://patft1.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO2%2526Sect2=HITOFF%2526u=%25252Fnetahtml%25252FPTO%25252Fsearch-adv.htm%2526r=130%2526f=G%2526l=50%2526d=PALL%2526s1=18730520.PD.%2526p=3%2526OS=%2526RS=ISD/18730520%252B |inventor-last=Davis | inventor-first =Jacob |inventor2-last=Strauss| inventor2-first =Levi |publication-date=9 August 1892| issue-date=20 May 1873 | title =Improvement in fastening pocket-openings |country-code=US |patent-number=139121 |accessdate=1 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by the 1870s this design was adopted by [[rancher]]s and [[cowboy]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Transcript, Levi Strauss vs. H.B.

ISBN 0-87830-526-2.&lt;/ref&gt; After [[World War II]], many women, returning to the home after working in the fields or factories while the men were overseas, began to wear jeans like the men.

==Neckwear==
[[File:Cowboy.1887.ws.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Working cowboy wearing a bandana or &quot;wild rag,&quot; 1880s]]
During the [[Victorian era]], gentlemen would wear silk [[cravat]]s or [[necktie]]s to add color to their otherwise sober black or grey attire. These continued to be worn by respectable Westerners until the early 20th century. Following the Civil War it became common practise among working class veterans to loosely tie a [[bandana]] around their necks to absorb sweat and keep the dust out of their faces. This practise originated in the [[Mexican–American War|Mexican War]] era regular army when troops threw away the hated [[leather]] [[leatherneck|stock]]s (a type of [[collar (clothing)|collar]] issued to soldiers) and replaced them with cheap [[paisley (design)|paisley]] [[kerchief]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=-X2vvS698p4C&amp;lpg=PA84&amp;ots=EYg8U-33vX&amp;dq=neck%20stock%20regular%20us%20army&amp;pg=PA84#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''Don Troiani's Soldiers in America'']&lt;/ref&gt;

Another well-known Western accessory, the [[bolo tie]], was a [[American pioneer|pioneer]] invention reputedly made from an expensive hatband.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationalcowboymuseum.org/events/event.aspx?ID=127 Arte en la Charerria: The Artisanship of Mexican Equestrian Culture] at the [http://www.nationalcowboymuseum.org/events/event.aspx?ID=127 National Cowboy &amp; Western Heritage Museum, Oklahoma City]&lt;/ref&gt; This was a favorite for [[gambler]]s and was quickly adopted by Mexican [[charro]]s, together with the slim &quot;Kentucky&quot; style [[bowtie]] commonly seen on stereotypical Southern gentlemen like [[Colonel Sanders]]&lt;ref&gt;Pearce, John, ''The Colonel'' (1982) ISBN 0-385-18122-1&lt;/ref&gt; or [[Boss Hogg]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">A '''dress shirt''', '''button shirt''', '''button-front''', '''button-front shirt''', '''button-down''', '''button-down shirt''', or '''button-up shirt'''  is a garment with a [[Collar (clothing)|collar]] and a full-length opening at the front, which is fastened using [[buttons]] or [[shirt stud]]s.

Dress shirts are normally made from  woven [[cloth]], and are often accompanied by a [[jacket]], collar sleeve, and [[Necktie|tie]], for example with a [[suit (clothing)|suit]] or [[formalwear]], but shirts are also worn more casually.

In [[British English]], &quot;dress shirt&quot; means specifically the more formal evening garment worn with [[black tie|black-]] or [[white tie|white-]]tie. Some of these formal shirts have stiff fronts and [[detachable collar]]s attached with [[collar stud]]s.

Traditionally dress shirts were worn by men and boys, whereas women and girls often wore [[blouse]]s or, sometimes, known as [[chemise]]s. However, in the mid-1800s, they also became an item of women's clothing and are worn by both sexes today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Brough|first=Dean|title=The classic white formal shirt : a powerful emblem of social change.|journal=15th Annual IFFTI Conference : The Business &amp; Marketing of Icons|date=April 2013|url=http://eprints.qut.edu.au/59300/}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The term &quot;button-down&quot; refers to a type of shirt which has a collar fastened down by buttons,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Blanchard|first=Tamsin|work=The Independent|title=Career Notes: The Button-Down Shirt|date=15 April 1996|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/career-notes-the-buttondown-shirt-1304981.html|accessdate=April 22, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; but is sometimes used in error to apply to all dress shirts.

==Components==

A shirt has several components: A one-piece back, which is usually pleated, gathered, or eased into a section of fabric in the upper part of the back behind the neck and over the shoulders known as the yoke (either one-piece or seamed vertically in the middle); one-piece sleeves with [[plackets]] at the wrist, or else short-sleeved (cut off above the elbow), though this is not traditional; a band of fabric around each wrist known as a cuff; the collar, a strip around the neck, which is normally a turndown collar, with the strip folded down away from the neck, leaving two points at the front, the width of which is known as the spread;  and finally two front panels which overlap slightly down the middle on the placket to fasten with buttons (or rarely [[shirt studs]]).

===Collars===
{{Main|Collar (clothing)|l1=Collar}}
[[File:Arnaud Rousseau Dress Shirt with a Modern Spread Collar.jpg|thumb|Spread collars measure from around {{convert|3 +1/2|to|8+1/2|in}} between the collar points.]]
There are various different styles of collar, which is the primary indicator of the formality of a shirt.&lt;ref&gt;Antongiavanni (2002). p. 101&lt;/ref&gt; Those discussed here are all attached collars, not styles specific to [[detachable collar]]s. The very top button is number 1.

* Spread collars measure from around {{convert|3+1/2|to|8+1/2|in}} between the collar points, and the wider collars are often referred to as ''cutaway'' or ''Windsor'' collars after the [[Edward VIII of the United Kingdom|Duke of Windsor]]. This city style is more formal, though it is common in Europe, and predominant in the UK.
* Point, straight, or small collars are narrow, with {{convert|2+1/2|to|4|in}} between the points of the collar.
* Button-down collars have points fastened down by buttons on the front of the shirt. Introduced by [[Brooks Brothers]] in 1896, they were patterned after the shirts of [[polo]] players and were used exclusively on sports shirts until the 1950s in America. It is still considered a more sporting style, and, particularly outside America, traditionally dressed men still do not wear suits with this style of collar.
The less-common styles below were all once common, but have waned in popularity.
* Eyelet collars require a barbell-style [[collar bar]] to join the small stitched hole on each point.
* Tab collars are point collars with two strips of fabric extending from the middle of the collar and joined behind the tie. These lift the tie, giving an arc effect similar to a [[collar pin|pinned collar]]. The tabs can be closed with a metal snap, button or stud.
* Club collars have rounded edges, and were very popular in the first few decades of the twentieth century. They have recently received a surge in popularity due to television shows like ''[[Mad Men]]''.
* The varsity is a type of spread collar in which the points curve outward from the placket of the shirt.
* Shirts designed to take a detachable collar have a tunic collar, which is a low standing band of fabric around the neck, with a hole at the front and back for the [[collar stud]]s.

Contrast collar shirts are occasionally made, which are white collars on a coloured or patterned shirt.  These are worn for a variety of reasons, such as to offset certain complexions;&lt;ref&gt;Flusser (2002). p. 27&lt;/ref&gt; because of a tradition started by [[detachable collar]]s, where it is impractical to have many collars in different matching colours; and finally because when a collar is replaced it is unlikely an exact colour match will be found. These collars are generally considered more formal than matching fabric.

===Cuffs===
{{Main|Cuff}}
[[File:Smart Casual Dress Example.jpg|thumb|Double cuffs have an extra length of sleeve folded back and fastened with links.]]
The main distinctions between cuffs are whether they require buttons or [[cufflinks]] to fasten, and whether they are folded back (''double'') or single. The main resulting types are therefore:

* Barrel cuffs, the standard style fastened by one or two buttons according to taste.
* Double, or French cuffs, which are more formal, have an extra length of sleeve folded back and fastened with links.
* Single cuffs, the most formal style, usually only worn with formal eveningwear, are double cuffs without the fold.

In addition, there are some variations, for example barrel cuffs may be mitred, with the corner cut off at 45°.  Less common styles include the ''Portofino'', or ''cocktail'' cuff, which is a double cuff closed with buttons, first made by the [[Jermyn Street]] shirtmakers [[Turnbull &amp; Asser]], and later popularised by the fictional character [[James Bond]] in the films from 1962 onwards.

===Other features===
A high quality traditional shirt has long tails, extending almost to the knees at the back, and so has seven or eight buttons. The vertical strip of fabric running down the front opening is called the placket, and gives a more symmetrical appearance to the joint between the left side, on top, and the right. This left over right order is also seen in waistcoat and coat fastenings, though women's clothing buttons the other way (right over left). The buttonholes, aligned vertically, are placed on the placket, though the top button and buttons at the bottom of stiff fronts are aligned horizontally. The buttonholes are one of the few places where the difference between hand and machine stitching can be observed while the shirt is being worn, and fashion designers sometimes use contrasting thread here or on the buttons themselves for extra impact.

To give extra fullness to the back, there are often [[pleat]]s where the back panel joins to the yoke.  On some fittings these are not needed, and handmade shirts may feature the extra fabric being worked continuously into the seam.  In America, a box pleat is common (two pleats together in the centre), while in Britain the pleats are placed wider out under the shoulders.

The less casual shirts in Britain will have no pockets, but the standard shirt in America has a single one on the wearer's left side, which is a sewn-on patch with a plain upper hem, optionally with a single button for closure. This small pocket is large enough to hold a pack of [[cigarettes]] or a few pens (a [[pocket protector]] can be used). Less formal shirts may feature larger pockets, dual pockets, or pockets with flap closures; safari or other military styled shirts often feature two large pockets with buttoned flaps. Less formal shirts may have small pockets on the sleeves as well. [[Shoulder strap#Shirt shoulder strap|Shoulder straps]] are virtually non-existent on formal shirts, with the exception of military clothing.

Short-sleeved shirts have a plain (no-button) hem above the wearer's elbow. They are considered a casual summer or tropical option, though many people wear only the traditional long sleeves in all circumstances.

==Formal shirts==&lt;!--Linked to from outside; do not change section heading.--&gt;
In the UK, the term ''dress shirt'' is reserved for a particular type of formal shirt.  There are formal day shirts for wearing with [[morning dress]], and the white dress shirts used as eveningwear.

A day dress shirt is fairly similar to a normal shirt, and is usually white, with a stiff [[detachable collar]], though other designs, such as a vertical blue stripe, are also appropriate.  Double cuffs are most common. This sort of shirt is also conventionally worn by some barristers and judges.

An evening shirt, for wear with eveningwear, for example as part of [[black tie|black]] or [[white tie]] has some unique features. In the U.S., this shirt is often called a ''tuxedo shirt'' or ''tux shirt''.  The shirt is always white.

The shirt required for [[white tie]] is very specific. It should have a [[detachable collar|detachable]] [[wing collar]] and be fastened with [[shirt studs]] instead of buttons on the front. The studs are normally [[mother of pearl]] set in gold or silver, but black [[onyx]] inlay is also permissible. The cufflinks should match the studs. The shirt front has panels made of different material from the rest of the shirt which are the only parts seen under the waistcoat. The shape of the panels, one on each side, is either rectangular, or the older U-shape (designed to sit under the older 1920s U-shaped waistcoats, now largely replaced by the more modern V-shape). The material for the panels is either layers of thick plain cotton that is heavily [[starch]]ed (this type is often called a ''boiled front shirt'' as the shirt needs to be put in boiling water to remove the starch before cleaning), or [[Piqué (weaving)|marcella]] (piqué) cotton.  Marcella is more common, but a little less formal, though still appropriate, since it was originally designed to be used on formal evening shirts, as the ribbing can pick up more starch and create an even stiffer front. Traditionally, collarless shirts with a detachable wing collar fastened on with collar studs have been used, but all-in-one designs are occasionally seen, though this is considered incorrect and to give a poor appearance by many.&lt;ref&gt;Flusser (2002). pp. 238&amp;ndash;239&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Antongiavanni (2006). p. 174&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cuff]]s are single, and heavily starched (if the front is marcella, the cuffs usually match).

[[Black tie]] offers more leeway. Shirts may be soft (not starched), which gives the options of unstarched marcella or a pleated front, as well as the white tie shirts, which may also be worn with black tie.  The collar is still sometimes a stiff high wing collar (common in America, though the attached variety is more popular there), or a turndown collar (more frequently seen in Britain). In past decades, particularly the 1970s, ruffled shirt fronts were made fashionable by Will Hunter,{{Citation needed|reason=Really? No hits on google, and added by IP, but giving BOD for a little while...|date=May 2009}} although they are now out of favour. Dress-studs are optional, and are onyx set in either silver or gold if used; otherwise the buttons are normally concealed under a placket. Cufflinks tend to be as simple and understated as possible, and harmonise with, if not match, the studs.

The [[placket]] of the shirt is the part that holds the buttons and the button holes. This is highly regarded as the focal point of the dress shirt when worn casually. Unfortunately due to the lack of reinforcement, the weight of the collar will cripple the placket throughout the day. No amount of starch, ironing, pressing nor does the type of fabric matter when it comes to combating the collapse. 

==Materials==
[[File:Polyester Shirt, close-up.jpg|thumb|[[Polyester]] is a common material with which to make dress shirts due to its low cost, despite being considered the poorest material by most shirtmakers.]]
Shirts are made of woven cloth. The natural fibers used in the past were [[cotton]] (the most frequent), [[linen]] (the oldest), [[ramie]], [[wool]] or [[silk]]. Nowadays, artificial fibers such as [[polyester]] or polyester blends are often used, due to their low cost, despite being considered by most shirtmakers the poorest material, owing to less softness and breathability.&lt;ref&gt;Antongiavanni (2006). p. 109&lt;/ref&gt; However, while high quality cotton shirts can survive with care a few decades, a polyester/cotton blend may be used in more demanding environments. Linen produces a cool fabric that wrinkles heavily, and is mostly used in light summer shirts.  Cotton is therefore the standard material for all but the cheapest shirts. Silk is occasionally worn, though it is hot to wear and has a marked sheen.

Yarns from these fibers are woven into a variety of different weaves, the most notable of which include [[broadcloth]], with double the number of [[warp (weaving)|warp]] to [[weft]] threads, giving a smooth, formal shirting; [[twill]], where the tucks of the weft do not line up, giving a diagonal pattern, a weave used for most country checked (''e.g.'' [[Tattersall (cloth)|Tattersall]]) shirtings; [[poplin]], with a heavier warp than weft, giving more formal fabric; and [[Oxford (cloth)|Oxford]] weaves. Plain Oxford or pinpoint Oxford weaves are popular as casual fabrics, so are generally used in combination with a button-down collar, while royal Oxford is versatile enough to be used on both sporty and formal shirts. There are many other weaves or variations on these, including [[end-on-end]] patterns, where alternate white and coloured threads are used, giving a mottled appearance, or more exotic weaves, including [[voile]] and [[batiste]], which are extremely light fabrics only used for summer shirts or on the unseen parts of formal shirts.&lt;ref&gt;Flusser (2002). pp. 135, 277&amp;ndash;305&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of pattern and colour is also significant.  Originally, in the [[Edwardian era]], when the modern shirt emerged, all shirts were white.  Gradually more colours were introduced, including blue, the most popular colour, particularly in lighter shades such as [[Wedgwood]]. A full range of colours is now worn, from pink to yellow. Less traditional shirts are also made with darker colours, even black, and bright or lighter colours and prints for very casual wear were popularised after the War by light holiday clothes such as [[Hawaiian shirt]]s.

The intended use of shirts dictates different choices of pattern. For example, country shirts are usually checked, with checks of different size to co-ordinate with [[Tweed (cloth)|tweeds]] of different pattern, and featuring one, two, or sometimes more colours of check over a light cream or white background.  For city shirts, plain or striped designs are more common, most stripes being vertical, while horizontal stripes are a legitimate option.  Herringbone patterns are worn informally and casually. Some colours, such as purple or pink, are generally only worn with city shirts. Further, the use of colour is seasonal, with shades like green being associated more with autumn than summer ones like yellow. Colours and patterns may be chosen for more than simply aesthetic reasons, as trends such as [[power dressing]] (first noted in Molloy, ''[[Dress for Success (book)|Dress for Success]]'' [1975]) emphasise the social impact of clothing. For example, a [[City of London|City]] executive might stereotypically wear strong vertical patterns for meetings to emphasise his authority.

=== Non-iron ===
[[Permanent press|Wrinkle-free]] shirts have become popular after being first introduced by [[Brooks Brothers]] in 1953.{{cn|date=January 2015}}

A resin used for making non-wrinkle shirts releases [[formaldehyde]], which could cause contact dermatitis for some people - particularly those who have already developed an allergy; no disclosure requirements exist, and in 2008 the U.S. [[Government Accountability Office]] tested formaldehyde in clothing and found that generally the highest levels were in non-wrinkle shirts and pants.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/11/your-money/11wrinkle.html When Wrinkle-Free Clothing Also Means Formaldehyde Fumes]. ''New York Times''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Shirt wearing==
[[File:A man ironing shirt.JPG|thumb|Dress shirts are ironed to remove wrinkles.]]
A dress shirt is [[Ironing|ironed]] to remove any wrinkles and can be treated with [[starch]] for added smoothness and stiffness. The hem is tucked into the [[trousers]]. For [[informal (attire)|informal-]] or [[formalwear]], a [[coat (clothing)|coat]] and [[necktie|tie]] (or [[bow tie]]) are compulsory. When a tie is worn, the top button of the shirt is fastened, so the tie can fit snugly around the wearer’s neck with a neat appearance.

When a tie is not worn, conventions on buttoning differ globally: in the United States and the United Kingdom, the top button is virtually never buttoned if a tie is not worn – but unbuttoning two or more buttons is seen as overly casual.  In France, unbuttoning two buttons is more common, and politicians appear on TV in this style.

In casual usage, these conventions are often not followed, with many choosing to wear shirts not tucked in, or leaving the top button undone with a tie. This is commonly done by children and young men, particularly as part of [[school uniform]], where it is not allowed. Even more casually, some now choose not to iron their shirts, or use nontraditional 'non-iron' fabrics.

Similarly, as part of more casual work attire, some American men wear shirts with the top two buttons unbuttoned (buttoned at the third button), though buttoning at the fourth button is widely seen as too casual. Accordingly, some shirts are manufactured with a difference at the second or third button, by way of subtle cue as to where to button.&lt;ref&gt;[http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/living/2009369701_fashionunbuttoned22.html Fashion comes unbuttoned: How low will it go?], June 22, 2009, The Seattle Times&lt;/ref&gt;  Most casually, the shirt can be worn entirely unbuttoned, over a T-shirt.

==Fit==
In the US, [[ready-to-wear]] [[clothing size|sizes]] of dress shirts traditionally consist of two numbers  such as ''15½&amp;nbsp;34'', meaning that the shirt has a neck {{convert|15+1/2|in}} in girth (measured from centre of top button to centre of corresponding buttonhole) and a sleeve {{convert|34|in}} long (measured from midpoint of the back and shoulders to the wrist). However, to reduce the number of sizes needed to be manufactured and stocked, an average sleeve length is sometimes given in the form ''15½&amp;nbsp;34/35'' (indicating a neck {{convert|15+1/2|in}} in girth and a {{convert|34|in}} sleeve). Since the cuff frequently features two buttons, the cuff diameter can be reduced so that the cuff does not come down over the hand, allowing the shirt to fit the shorter length. Since the sleeve and neck size do not take into account waist size, some shirts are cut wide to accommodate large belly sizes. Shirts cut for flat stomachs are usually labeled, &quot;fitted&quot;, &quot;tailored fit&quot; &quot;athletic fit&quot; or &quot;trim fit&quot;. The terms for fuller cut shirts are more varied (&quot;Traditional&quot;, &quot;Regular&quot; ''etc.'') and are sometimes explained on a shirt maker's website. Additionally, &quot;Portly&quot; or &quot;Big&quot; are often used for neck sizes of {{convert|18|in}} or more. Very casual button-front shirts are often sized as small, medium, large, and so on. The meaning of these ''ad-hoc'' sizes is similarly not standardized and varies between manufacturers.

In the [[bespoke]] (custom-made) industry where each shirt is made from an individually drafted pattern, these sizing problems are avoided, though there are still different ways of making the shirt fit. While many choose to cut the sleeve long and have the cuff catch on the hand to regulate its length, some prefer the much harder option of using a high armhole and carefully tailored shape, so that the cuff can be loose and still sit in exactly the right place wherever the arm moves.&lt;ref&gt;Antongiavanni (2006). p. 106&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Made-to-measure]] shirts may not fit quite as well as bespoke, but can provide a similar degree of customisation and fit at a lower cost.

For sixty years, US designers and manufacturers of neckties and dress shirts were members of the [[Men's Dress Furnishings Association]] but the trade group shut down in 2008 due to declining membership caused by the declining numbers of men wearing neckties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://online.wsj.com/article/SB121253690573743197.html?mod=googlenews_wsj|title=Tie Association, a Fashion Victim, Calls It Quits as Trends Change|last=Smith |first=Ray|date=June 4, 2008|work=Wall Street Journal|pages=A1|accessdate=2008-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''hoop skirt''' or '''hoopskirt''' is a women's [[undergarment]] worn in various periods to hold the [[skirt]] extended into a fashionable shape. Its Tudor name was a '[[farthingale]]'.

It originated as a modest-sized mechanism for holding long skirts away from one's legs, to stay cooler in hot climates and to keep from tripping on the skirt during various activities.  Small hoops might be worn by farmers and while working in the garden.  Hoops were then adopted as a fashion item, and the size and scale of the hoops grew in grandeur.&lt;ref&gt;Williamsburg Historical Research&lt;/ref&gt;

Hoop skirts typically consist of a fabric [[petticoat]] sewn with channels designed to act as casings for stiffening materials, variously [[rope]], [[willow|osiers]], [[whalebone]], [[steel]], or, from the mid-20th century, [[nylon]].&lt;ref&gt;Arnold, Janet: ''Patterns of Fashion: the cut and construction of clothes for men and women 1560-1620'', Macmillan 1985.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Arnold, Janet:''Patterns of Fashion 2: Englishwomen's Dresses and Their Construction C.1860-1940'', Wace 1966, Macmillan 1972.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hoop skirts are called by various names in different periods:
*[[Farthingale]] ([[Spanish (language)|Spanish]] ''verdugado'') (16th century)
*[[Pannier (clothing)|Pannier]]s or &quot;side hoops&quot; (18th century)
*[[Crinoline]] or crinolette (mid-19th century)

Lightweight hoop skirts, usually with nylon hoops, are worn today under very full-skirted [[wedding gown]]s. They can sometimes be seen in the [[gothic fashion]] scene.  Reproduction hoop skirts are an essential part of [[living history]] costuming, including  [[American Civil War reenactment]].

{{Dress code (Western)}}
In Western clothing '''semi-formal''' is a grouping of [[dress code (Western)|dress codes]] indicating the sort of clothes worn to events with a level of [[Etiquette|protocol]] between [[informal attire|informal]] (e.g., [[lounge suit]]) and [[formal wear|formal]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.blacktieguide.com/Basics/3A_Dress_Codes1.htm Black Tie Guide | Dress Codes]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Verify credibility|date=January 2012}}{{fv|date=December 2012}} Both morning and evening semi-formal attire share design features in common with the informal lounge suit.

==Variations==
Whether one would choose to wear morning or evening semi-formal has traditionally been defined by whether the event will commence before or after 6:00 p.m.

===Morning===
In the daytime (before six o'clock), the semi-formal code requires for men a black tail-less coat with formal (striped or checked) trousers.  This combination is a less formal version of [[morning dress]], which features a longer, cutaway [[morning coat]].  This semi-formal ensemble is sometimes referred to as a &quot;[[stroller (style)|stroller]]&quot; in North America though it is unknown in the UK, where, though the garment itself saw a limited period of popularity, was simply called ''black lounge''. Because black was then reserved for formalwear, it was unknown as a color for [[lounge suit]]s, so the term was unambiguous. In the UK this mode of dress is now extremely unusual, though some [[Freemasonry|Masonic]] Lodges which meet during the day rather than (as is more common) in the evening do continue to specify it as their dress code. It also still is worn within the legal profession, especially by barristers. Indeed, the striped trousers are in some circles referred to as &quot;barrister trousers&quot;.  In [[German language|German]], a stroller is called a ''Stresemann'', after the [[Weimar Republic|German]] foreign secretary [[Gustav Stresemann]]. Stresemann, like other German politicians of his age, wore morning dress or a [[frock coat]] in the [[Reichstag (Weimar Republic)|Reichstag]] or when making public appearances. However, Stresemann found the long coat impractical for daily work in the Chancellery. To avoid having to change completely, he began to wear the prototype of this jacket at his office, while switching to a morning coat when engaged on more formal business. The style quickly caught on as a more practical variation on morning dress. In [[Japan]], it is known as a &quot;director's suit&quot;, from the term ''[[inside director]]''.

===Evening===
For evening wear, the corresponding code is [[black tie]] (shortened ''[[tuxedo]]'' in American English).&lt;ref name=&quot;Flusser02&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Flusser |first=Alan |authorlink=Alan Flusser |title=Dressing the Man: Mastering the art of Permanent Fashion |publisher=[[HarperCollins|HarperCollins Publishers, Inc.]]|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=hBnCNOhoh1sC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=Dressing%20the%20Man%3A%20Mastering%20the%20art%20of%20Permanent%20Fashion&amp;pg=PP1#v=onepage&amp;q=Dressing%20the%20Man:%20Mastering%20the%20art%20of%20Permanent%20Fashion&amp;f=false |date=2002 |location=[[New York]] |isbn=0-06-019144-9 |page=299}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name &quot;black tie&quot; for this type of evening wear can be misleading because it is a generally accepted practice to substitute the traditional black tie for other colors. In formal evening dress, or [[white tie]] dress, this practice of substituting colors in ties is much less common since men's fashion tends to follow tradition more deeply as it becomes more formal.

The origins of evening semi-formal attire date back to the later 19th century when Edward, [[Prince of Wales]] (subsequently [[Edward VII]]), wanted a more comfortable dinner attire than the [[Dress coat|swallowtail coat]].&lt;ref name=Flusser01&gt;{{cite book |last=Flusser |first=Alan |authorlink=Alan Flusser |title=Dressing the Man: Mastering the art of Permanent Fashion |publisher=[[HarperCollins|HarperCollins Publishers, Inc.]]|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=hBnCNOhoh1sC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=Dressing%20the%20Man%3A%20Mastering%20the%20art%20of%20Permanent%20Fashion&amp;pg=PP1#v=onepage&amp;q=Dressing%20the%20Man:%20Mastering%20the%20art%20of%20Permanent%20Fashion&amp;f=false |date=2002 |location=[[New York]] |isbn=0-06-019144-9 |page=240}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the spring of 1886, the Prince invited James Potter, a rich New Yorker, and his wife [[Cora Urquhart Brown-Potter|Cora]] to [[Sandringham House]], the Prince's hunting estate in [[Norfolk]]. When Potter asked for the Prince's dinner dress code, the Prince sent him to his tailor, [[Henry Poole &amp; Co.]], in London, where he was given a suit made to the Prince's specifications with the dinner jacket.&lt;ref name=Flusser03&gt;{{cite book |last=Flusser |first=Alan |authorlink=Alan Flusser |title=Dressing the Man: Mastering the art of Permanent Fashion |publisher=[[HarperCollins|HarperCollins Publishers, Inc.]]|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=hBnCNOhoh1sC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=Dressing%20the%20Man%3A%20Mastering%20the%20art%20of%20Permanent%20Fashion&amp;pg=PP1#v=onepage&amp;q=Dressing%20the%20Man:%20Mastering%20the%20art%20of%20Permanent%20Fashion&amp;f=false |date=2002 |location=[[New York]]|page=240, 241, 303 |isbn=0-06-019144-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On returning to [[Tuxedo Park, New York]], in 1886, Potter's dinner suit proved popular at the [[Tuxedo Club|Tuxedo Park Club]]. Not long afterward, when a group of men from the club chose to wear such suits to a dinner at [[Delmonico's Restaurant]] in [[New York City]], other diners were surprised. They were told that such clothing was popular at Tuxedo Park, so the particular cut then became known as the &quot;tuxedo&quot;.&lt;ref name=Flusser03/&gt;

From its creation into the 1920s, this [[dinner jacket]] was considered appropriate dress for dining in one's home or club, while the tailcoat remained in place as appropriate for public appearance.&lt;ref name= Flusser01/&gt;

{{Dress code (Western)}}

In the European tradition, '''casual''' is the [[dress code]] that emphasizes comfort and personal expression over presentation, formality and conformity. More simply, &quot;casual&quot; can be defined as something relaxed, occasional, not planned, or informal.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.yourdictionary.com/casual&lt;/ref&gt; It includes a very wide variety of [[costume]], so it is perhaps better defined by what it ''is not'' than what it ''is''. The following ''are not'' considered casual wear:
* [[Ceremonial dress]] such as royal robes and [[full dress]] military costume
* [[Formal wear]] such as [[white tie]].
* [[Semi-formal]] such as [[black tie]].
* [[Informal attire|Informal]] business professional wear such as [[suit (clothing)|suits]] and ties.

Although it can be considered &quot;[[wiktionary:informal|informal]]&quot; in the senses of &quot;not formal&quot; or &quot;suited for everyday use,&quot; [[informal attire]] actually refers to a dress code much more formal than '''casual wear''', a step below [[Semi-formal]] wear.

[[Jeans]] and a [[T-shirt]] have been described as the &quot;casual uniform&quot;. With the popularity of [[spectator sports]] in the late 20th century, a good deal of athletic gear has influenced casual wear.  Clothing worn for [[manual labour|manual labor]] also falls into casual wear.

Basic materials used for casual wear include denim, cotton, jersey, polyester, flannel, and fleece. It is best to avoid wearing materials such as velvet, chiffon, and brocade.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.namedclothing.com/material-chart/&lt;/ref&gt;

While utilitarian costume comes to mind first for casual dress, however, there is also a wide range of flamboyance and theatricality. [[Punk fashion|Punk]] costume is a striking example.  [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] introduced a great deal of [[lace]], [[jewelry]], and [[cosmetics]] into casual wear during the 1980s.  More recently, [[hip hop fashion]] has played up elaborate jewelry and luxurious materials worn in conjunction with athletic gear and the clothing of manual labor.

Casual wear is typically the dress code in which new forms of [[gender expression]] are attempted before being accepted into semi-casual or semi-formal situations.  An obvious example is [[masculinity|masculine]] jewelry, which was once considered shocking or titillating even in casual circles, and is now hardly noteworthy in semi-formal situations.  [[Amelia Bloomer]] introduced trousers (of a sort) for women as a casual alternative to formal hoops and skirts.  In a recent mirror image, [[sarong]]s and other skirts have been embraced by a few men of the European tradition as a casual alternative to formal trousers.  Both of these innovations caused great embarrassment in formal circles.

The trend toward female exposure in the 20th century has also pushed the necklines of formal [[ball gown]]s ever lower and the skirts of [[cocktail dress]]es ever higher.  For men, the exposure of shoulders, thighs, and backs is still limited to casual wear.

[[File:LAR-Konferanse 06 Foto Lars-Andreas Kvisle - forsamling 5.jpg|thumb|Conference on [[medicament]]-assisted rehabilitation in [[Oslo]], [[Norway]]]]
An '''academic conference''' or '''symposium''' is a [[:wikt:conference|conference]] for [[researcher]]s (not necessarily [[academic]]s) to present and discuss their work. Together with [[academic journal|academic]] or [[scientific journal]]s, conferences provide an important channel for exchange of information between researchers.

== Overview ==

Conferences are usually composed of various [[presentation]]s. They tend to be short and concise, with a time span of about 10 to 30 minutes; [[presentation]]s are usually followed by a [[discussion]]. The work may be bundled in written form as [[academic paper]]s and [[publish]]ed as the conference [[proceedings]].

Usually a conference will include [[keynote speaker]]s (often, scholars of some standing, but sometimes individuals from outside academia). The keynote lecture is often longer, lasting sometimes up to an hour and a half, particularly if there are several keynote speakers on a [[Convention panel|panel]].

In addition to presentations, conferences also feature panel discussions, [[Round table (discussion)|round table]]s on various issues and workshops.

=== Presentations ===

Prospective presenters are usually asked to submit a short abstract of their presentation, which will be reviewed before the presentation is accepted for the meeting. Some disciplines require presenters to submit a paper of about 6–15 pages, which is [[peer review]]ed by members of the [[program committee]] or referees chosen by them.

In some disciplines, such as English and other languages, it is common for presenters to read from a prepared script. In other disciplines such as the sciences, presenters usually base their talk around a visual presentation that displays key figures and research results.

=== Size ===

A large meeting will usually be called a conference, while a smaller is termed a workshop. They might be ''single track'' or ''multiple track'', where the former has only one session at a time, while a multiple track meeting has several parallel sessions with speakers in separate rooms speaking at the same time.

The larger the conference, the more likely it is that [[Academic publishing|academic publishing houses]] may set up displays. Large conferences also may have a career and job search and interview activities.

At some conferences, social or entertainment activities such as tours and receptions can be part of the program. Business meetings for [[learned society|learned societies]] or [[interest group]]s can also be part of the conference activities.

=== Types ===

Academic conferences typically fall into three categories:
* the themed conference, small conferences organized around a particular topic;
* the general conference, a conference with a wider focus, with sessions on a wide variety of topics. These conferences are often organized by regional, national, or international [[learned society|learned societies]], and held annually or on some other regular basis.
* the professional conference, large conferences not limited to academics but with academically related issues.

=== Infrastructure ===

Increasing numbers of [[amplified conference]]s are being provided which exploit the potential of WiFi networks and mobile devices in order to enable remote participants to contribute to discussions and listen to ideas.

Advanced technology for meeting with any yet  unknown person in a conference is performed by active RFID that may indicate wilfully identified and relatively located upon approach via electronic tags.

==Organizing an academic conference==
Conferences are usually organized either by a scientific society or by a group of researchers with a common interest. Larger meetings may be handled on behalf of the scientific society by a [[Professional Conference Organiser]] or PCO.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=q9u11fI4Nc8C&amp;pg=PT321&amp;dq=pco+conferences |title=Conferences and Conventions: a global industry by Tony Rogers |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2012-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The meeting is announced by way of a Call For Papers (CFP) or a Call For Abstracts, which is sent to prospective presenters and explains how to submit their abstracts or papers. It describes the broad theme and lists the meeting's topics and formalities such as what kind of [[abstract (summary)]] or paper has to be submitted, to whom, and by what [[Time limit|deadline]]. A CFP is usually distributed using a mailing list or on specialized online services. Contributions are usually submitted using an online [[Paper management|abstract or paper management]] service.

==Fraudulent conferences==
There have been accusations for fake, scam, or fraudulent conferences;&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com.br/books?id=U35HVJyADlEC&amp;pg=PT172 Cybercrime: The Psychology of Online Offenders]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9890770 nih.gov]&lt;/ref&gt; see also [[BIT Life Sciences]] and [[SCIgen#In conferences|SCIgen § In conferences]].

'''Fur clothing''' is [[clothing]] made of [[fur]]ry animal [[hide (skin)|hides]]. Fur is one of the oldest forms of clothing; thought to have been widely used as hominids first expanded outside Africa. Some view fur as luxurious and warm; however others reject it due to moral beliefs. The term 'a fur' is often used to refer to a coat, wrap, or shawl made from the fur of animals. Controversy exists regarding the wearing of fur coats, due to animal cruelty concerns.

==History and use==
{{Further|History of hide materials}}
[[File:Lagerraum von Lomer &amp; Co (vor 1906).jpg|thumb|left|180px|Wholesale dealer (Leipzig, c.&amp;nbsp;1900)]]
[[File:Fur sewing machine.jpg|thumb|left|180px|Fur sewing machine ''Success'' from &quot;Allbook &amp; Hashfield&quot;, [[Nottingham, England]]]]
Fur is generally thought to have been among the first materials used for clothing and bodily decoration. The exact date when fur was first used in [[clothes|clothing]] is debated. It is known that several species of [[hominoids]] including ''[[Homo sapiens]]'' and ''[[Homo neanderthalensis]]'' used fur clothing.

Fur is still worn in most mild and cool climates around the world due to its superior warmth and durability.  From the days of early European settlement, up until the development of modern clothing alternatives, fur clothing was popular in Canada during the cold winters.  The invention of inexpensive synthetic textiles for insulating clothing led to fur clothing falling out of [[fashion]].

Fur is still used by [[indigenous people]] and developed societies, due to its availability and superior [[Thermal insulation|insulation]] properties. The [[Inuit]] peoples of the Arctic relied on fur for most of their clothing, and it also forms a part of traditional [[Russian clothing|Russian]], [[Scandinavia]]n and [[Culture of Japan#Traditional clothing|Japanese]] clothing.

It is also sometimes associated with glamour and lavish spending. A number of consumers and designers—notably British fashion designer and outspoken animal rights activist [[Stella McCartney]]—reject fur due to moral beliefs and perceived [[cruelty to animals]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Humane Society of the United States&quot;&gt;[http://www.hsus.org/furfree/fashion/retailers/furfree_retailers_designers.html &quot;Fur-Free Designers and Retailers&quot;] July 31, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Animal furs used in garments and trim may be dyed bright colors or with patterns, often to mimic exotic animal pelts: alternatively they may be left their original pattern and color. Fur may be shorn down to imitate the feel of [[velvet]], creating a fabric called [[shearling]].

==Sources==
{{see also|List of types of fur}}
Common animal sources for fur clothing and fur trimmed accessories include [[fox]], [[Rabbit#Rabbits as food and clothing|rabbit]], [[mink]], [[muskrat]], [[beaver]], [[stoat]] (ermine), [[otter]], [[sable]], [[Pinniped|seal]]s, [[cat]]s, [[dog]]s, [[coyote]]s, [[chinchilla]], and [[possum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/bizfocus/archives/2008/12/21/2003431724 |title=New Zealand turns a pest into luxury business |publisher=Taipeitimes.com |date=2011-12-28 |accessdate=2012-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of these are more highly prized than others, and there are many grades and colors.

In Europe and Asia, cheap and plentiful dog and cat fur is sold under different names to disguise the origin from shoppers in the [[United States]], such as dog fur being labeled &quot;Mongolian Wolf&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dawn&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Dawn |first=Karen |authorlink=Karen Dawn |title=Thanking the Monkey: Rethinking the Way we Treat Animals |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=pt7ZirPwG1sC&amp;dq=thanking+the+monkey&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=xpo_UaMCk8PQAYiTgNAO&amp;ved=0CDgQ6AEwAA |accessdate=12 March 2013 |edition=1st |year=2008 |publisher=[[HarperCollins]] |location=[[New York City]] |isbn=978-0-06-135185-3 |pages=109–10}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a study by the [[Humane Society of the United States]], all twenty-five fur trim coats from twenty different retailers were found to be mislabeled, usually in the case of fur from an animal that it is illegal to kill for fur being labeled as a legal animal.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dawn&quot;/&gt; One example of this was a coat being labeled as having fur from a [[raccoon]], when in reality DNA testing proved that the fur came from a [[raccoon dog]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Dawn&quot;/&gt;

==Processing of fur==
[[File:Nutukkaat.JPG|thumb|right|Traditional [[Sami people|Sami]] fur [[footwear]]]]
The manufacturing of fur clothing involves obtaining animal pelts where the hair is left on. Depending on the type of fur and its purpose, some of the chemicals involved in fur processing may include table salts, alum salts, acids, soda ash, sawdust, cornstarch, lanolin, degreasers and, less commonly, bleaches, dyes and toners (for dyed fur).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Jos. H. Lowenstein &amp; Sons Inc. |url=http://www.jhlowenstein.com/fur/ |title=Fur Products |publisher=Jhlowenstein.com |date= |accessdate=2012-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Workers exposed to fur dust created during fur processing have been shown to have reduced pulmonary function in direct proportion to their length of exposure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cat.inist.fr/?aModele=afficheN&amp;cpsidt=14777753 |title=Pulmonary function in fur-processing workers: A dose-response relationship |publisher=Cat.inist.fr |date= |accessdate=2012-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast, [[leather]] made from any animal hide involves removing the fur from the skin and using only the tanned skin. The use of [[wool]] involves shearing the animal's hair from the living animal, so that the wool can be regrown. [[Fake fur]] (or &quot;faux fur&quot;) designates any [[synthetic material]] that attempts to mimic the appearance and feel of real fur.

The chemical treatment of fur to increase its felting quality is known as carroting, as the process tends to turn the tips of the fur a carrot orange color. A furrier is a person who makes fur products as fur garments, fur blankets etc. and repairs, alters, cleans, or otherwise deals in furs of animals.

==Anti-fur campaigns==
{{main|Fur farming}}

Anti-fur campaigns reached a peak in the 1980s and 1990s, with the participation of numerous celebrities.&lt;ref&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20060318113019/http://www.furcommission.com/news/newsF08z.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Fur clothing has become the focus of boycotts on the opinion that it is cruel and unnecessary. [[PETA]] and other animal rights organizations, celebrities, and animal rights ethicists, have called attention to fur farming.

[[Animal rights]] advocates object to the trapping and killing of wildlife, and to the confinement and killing of animals on [[Fur farming|fur farms]] due to concerns about the animals suffering and death. They may also condemn &quot;alternatives&quot; made from synthetic (oil-based) clothing as they promote fur for the sake of fashion. Protests also include objection to the use of leather in clothing, shoes and accessories.

Some animal rights activists have disrupted fur fashion shows with protests, while other anti-fur protesters may use fashion shows featuring faux furs or other alternatives to fur clothing as a platform to highlight animal suffering from the use of real leathers and furs. These groups sponsor &quot;Compassionate Fashion Day&quot; on the third Saturday of August to promote their anti-fur message. Other groups participate in &quot;Fur Free Friday&quot;, an event held annually on the Friday after Thanksgiving ([[Black Friday (shopping)|Black Friday]]) that occurs globally with the intent to bring the issue of fur to light through educational displays, protests and other methods of campaigning.

In Canada, opposition to the annual [[seal hunt]] is viewed as an anti-fur issue, although the [[Humane Society of the United States]] claims that its opposition is to &quot;the largest slaughter of marine mammals on Earth.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20100616040111/http://www.humanesociety.org/issues/seal_hunt/&lt;/ref&gt; [[IFAW]], an anti-sealing group, claims that Canada has an &quot;abysmal record of enforcement&quot; of anti-cruelty laws surrounding the hunt.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ifaw.org/united-kingdom/our-work/seals/why-commercial-sealing-cruel IFAW - Revisions to Seal Hunt Regulations Meaningless Without Enforcement, Consistency: IFAW.]&lt;/ref&gt; A Canadian government survey&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080512014542/http://www.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/seal-phoque/reports-rapports/study-etude/study-etude_e.htm 2000 Canadian Government survey, 2000]&lt;/ref&gt; indicated that two-thirds of Canadians supported the hunting of seals if the regulations under Canadian law are enforced.

Products from all marine mammals, even from non-threatened populations and regulated hunts, such as the Canadian seal hunt, are banned in the United States, with minor exceptions for [[Alaska Natives]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nmfs.noaa.gov/pr/laws/mmpa/ |title=Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA) of 1972 |publisher=Nmfs.noaa.gov |date= |accessdate=2012-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{main|Fur trade}}
The fur trade is the worldwide buying and selling of fur for clothing and other purposes.  The fur trade was one of the driving forces of exploration of North America and the Russian Far East.

'''Independence Day''', observed annually on 15 august is a [[Public holidays in India|national holiday]] in [[India]] commemorating the nation's independence from the [[British Empire]] on 15 August 1947. India attained independence following an [[Indian independence movement|Independence Movement]] noted for largely [[nonviolent resistance]] and [[civil disobedience]] led by the [[Indian National Congress]] (INC). Independence coincided with the [[partition of India]], in which the [[British Indian Empire]] was divided along religious lines into the [[Dominion]]s of [[Dominion of India|India]] and [[Dominion of Pakistan|Pakistan]]; the partition was accompanied by violent riots and mass casualties, and the displacement of nearly 15 million people due to sectarian violence. On 15 August 1947, [[Jawaharlal Nehru]], who had become the first [[Prime Minister of India]] that day, raised the [[Flag of India|Indian national flag]] above the [[Lahori Gate (Red Fort)|Lahori Gate]] of the [[Red Fort]] in Delhi. On each subsequent Independence Day, the prime minister has raised the flag and given a speech.&lt;ref&gt;PTI (15 August 2013).

''[[The Hindu]]''. Retrieved 30 August 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

The holiday is observed throughout India with flag-hoisting ceremonies, parades and cultural events. Indians celebrate the day by displaying the national flag on their attire, accessories and homes; by listening to patriotic songs, watching patriotic movies; and bonding with family and friends. Books and films feature the independence and partition in their narrative. There have been threats of terrorist attack on and around 15 August by separatist and militant organisations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/intelligence-warns-of-terror-strike-in-delhi-ahead-of-independence-day/1/456280.html |title=Terror strike feared in Delhi ahead of Independence Day : MM-National, News - India Today |publisher=Indiatoday.intoday.in |date=2015-08-05 |accessdate=2015-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ibtimes.co.in/69th-independence-day-security-tightened-red-fort-terror-threat-looms-large-modi-642738 |title=69th Independence Day: Security Tightened at Red Fort as Terror Threat Looms Large on PM Modi |publisher=Ibtimes.co.in |date=2015-02-28 |accessdate=2015-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{main|Indian independence movement}}

[[Europe]]an traders had established outposts on the [[Indian subcontinent]] by the 17th century. Through overwhelming military strength, the [[British East India]] company subdued local kingdoms and [[Company rule in India|established themselves]] as the dominant force by the 18th century. Following the [[Rebellion of 1857]], the [[Government of India Act 1858]] led the [[British Crown]] to assume direct control of India. In the decades following, [[civic society]] gradually emerged across India, most notably the [[Indian National Congress Party]], formed in 1885.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sarkar|first=Sumit|authorlink=Sumit Sarkar|title=Modern India, 1885–1947|year=1983|publisher=[[Macmillan Publishers|Macmillan]]|isbn=978-0-333-90425-1|pages=1–4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;metcalf conc&quot;/&gt;{{rp|123}} The period after [[World War I]] was marked by British reforms such as the [[Montagu–Chelmsford Reforms]], but it also witnessed the enactment of the repressive [[Rowlatt Act]] and calls for self-rule by Indian activists. The discontent of this period crystallized into nationwide non-violent movements of non-cooperation and civil disobedience, led by [[Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi]].&lt;ref name=&quot;metcalf conc&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last1=Metcalf|first1=B.|last2=Metcalf|first2=T.

During the 1930s, reform was gradually legislated by the British; Congress won victories in the resulting elections.&lt;ref name=&quot;metcalf conc&quot;/&gt;{{rp|195–197}} The next decade was beset with political turmoil: [[India in World War II|Indian participation in World War II]], the Congress' final push for non-cooperation, and an upsurge of [[Muslim nationalism]] led by the [[All-India Muslim League]]. The escalating political tension was capped by Independence in 1947. The jubilation was tempered by the [[Partition of India|bloody partition]] of the subcontinent into India and Pakistan.&lt;ref name=&quot;metcalf conc&quot;/&gt;{{rp|203}}

===Independence Day before Independence===
At the 1929 [[Lahore]] session of the Indian National Congress, the ''[[Purna Swaraj]]'' declaration, or &quot;Declaration of the Independence of India&quot; was promulgated,&lt;ref name=&quot;Wolpert1999&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Wolpert|first=Stanley A.|authorlink=Stanley Wolpert| title=India|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nHnOERqf-MQC|accessdate=20 July 2012|date=12 October 1999|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-22172-7|page=204}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 26 January was declared as Independence  Day.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wolpert1999&quot;/&gt; The Congress called on people to pledge themselves to [[civil disobedience]] and &quot;to carry out the Congress instructions issued from time to time&quot; until India attained complete independence.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gandhi2006&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=India's Date with Destiny|chapter=India's Independence Pledge|last=Datta|first=V.

We therefore hereby solemnly resolve to carry out the Congress instructions issued from time to time for the purpose of establishing Purna Swaraj.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Celebration of such an Independence Day was envisioned to stoke nationalistic fervour among Indian citizens, and to force the British government to consider granting independence.&lt;ref name=&quot;Guha2008&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Guha|first=Ramachandra|title=India After Gandhi: The History of the World's Largest Democracy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2fvd-CaFdqYC|accessdate=23 August 2012|date=12 August 2008|publisher=Harper Collins|isbn=978-0-06-095858-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|19}}

===Immediate background===
In 1946, the [[Labour Party (UK)#Post-war victory under Attlee|Labour government]] in Britain, its exchequer exhausted by the recently concluded [[World War II]], realised that it had neither the mandate at home, the international support, nor the reliability of [[British Indian Army|native forces]] for continuing to control an increasingly restless India.&lt;ref name=&quot;metcalf conc&quot;/&gt;{{rp|203}}&lt;ref name=Hyam106&gt;{{cite book|last=Hyam|first=Ronald|title=Britain's Declining Empire: the Road to Decolonisation, 1918–1968| year=2006|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-68555-9|page=106|quote=By the end of 1945, he and the Commander-in-chief, [[General Auckinleck]] were advising that there was a real threat in 1946 of large-scale anti-British disorder amounting to even a well-organized rising aiming to expel the British by paralysing the administration. &lt;br /&gt; ...it was clear to Attlee that everything depended on the spirit and reliability of the Indian Army:&quot;Provided that they do their duty, armed insurrection in India would not be an insoluble problem. If, however, the Indian Army was to go the other way, the picture would be very different. &lt;br&gt; ...Thus, [[Wavell]] concluded, if the army and the police &quot;failed&quot; Britain would be forced to go. In theory, it might be possible to revive and reinvigorate the services, and rule for another fifteen to twenty years, but:It is a fallacy to suppose that the solution lies in trying to maintain the status quo.

Long years ago we made a tryst with destiny, and now the time comes when we shall redeem our pledge, not wholly or in full measure, but very substantially. At the stroke of the midnight hour, when the world sleeps, India will awake to life and freedom. A moment comes, which comes but rarely in history, when we step out from the old to the new, when an age ends, and when the soul of a nation, long suppressed, finds utterance.

[[File:Siryedazam.jpg|thumb|200px|right| The two founders of Aligarh movement wearing Sherwani, Nawab Mohsin ul Mulk, Sir Syed Ahmed Khan, Justice [[Syed Mahmood]]]].
'''Sherwani''' ({{lang-hi|शेरवानी}}; {{lang-ur|{{Nastaliq|شیروانی}}}} {{lang-bn|শেরওয়ানি}}) is a long [[Coat (clothing)|coat]]-like garment worn in the [[Indian subcontinent]], very similar to a British [[Frock coat]] or a Polish [[żupan]]. It was traditionally associated with the aristocracy of the Indian subcontinent. It is worn over the [[Kurta]] and ''[[Churidar]]'', ''[[Dhoti]]'', ''Khara [[pajama]]'', a [[salwar]]. It can be distinguished from the achkan by the fact that it is often made from heavier suiting fabrics, and by the presence of a lining.

==History==
[[File:Man's 3-piece velvet suit c. 1755.jpg|right|thumb|200px|An 18th century British style [[frock coat]], on which the ''Sherwani'' was based.]]
The Sherwani originated in the 18th century [[British India]] as the [[European style]] court dress of nobles and royals of the [[Mughal Empire]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=WGpECgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA57&amp;lpg=PA57&amp;dq=british+frock+coat+sherwani&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=WHlN4L9cRY&amp;sig=zuY_KOPK7zx12lRNtTaqzTRAf4o&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiH2sCUyffKAhXGto4KHf7VBH4Q6AEIVDAP#v=onepage&amp;q=british%20frock%20coat%20sherwani&amp;f=false|title=Royal Patronage, Power and Aesthetics in Princely India|publisher=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; before being more generally adopted in the late eighteenth century. It appeared as a fusion of the British [[frock coat]] with the [[shalwar kameez]]. It was gradually adopted by rest of the Indian royalty and [[aristocracy]], and later by the general population, as a more evolved form of traditional attire.

==Bangladesh==
In Bengal ([[Bangladesh]] and [[West Bengal]]), the Sherwani or Achkan is worn by people on formal occasions such as weddings and [[wikt:Eid|eid]].

==India==
[[File:Nehru Roerich.jpg|thumb|200px||[[Jawaharlal Nehru]](left) wearing an Achkan Sherwani.]]
In India, the [[Achkan]] sherwani is generally worn for formal occasions in winter, especially by those from [[Rajasthan]], [[Punjab, India|Punjab]], [[Delhi]], [[Jammu]], [[Uttar Pradesh]] and [[Hyderabad, Telangana|Hyderabad]]. The Achkan sherwani is generally associated with the Hindus while the simple Sherwani was historically favored by Muslims. The two garments have significant similarities, though sherwanis typically are more flared at the hips and Achkans have are lengthier than simple Sherwanis. The achkan later evolved into the [[Nehru Jacket]], which is popular in India and Bangladesh.

The '''Hyderabadi Sherwani''' was the dress of choice of the [[Nizam of Hyderabad]] and Hyderabadi nobles. The Hyderabadi sherwani is longer than normal sherwani reaching below the knees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sherwani.askdefine.com/|title=Define sherwani - Dictionary and Thesaurus|publisher=sherwani.askdefine.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pakistan==
[[File:Jinnah speaking on 14 August 1947.jpg|thumb|200px||[[Jinnah]](right) addressing the Constituent Assembly on 14 August 1947, wearing a sherwani.]]
After the independence of [[Pakistan]], [[Mohammad Ali Jinnah]] frequently wore the Sherwani and made it the national dress of Pakistan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Ahmed |first=Akbar S. |date=1997 |title=Jinnah, Pakistan and Islamic Identity: The Search for Saladin |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=YGdiqF6V8wYC&amp;pg=PA99 |publisher=Psychology Press |pages=99– |isbn=978-0-415-14966-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following him most government officials in Pakistan such as the President and Prime Minister started to wear the formal black Sherwani over the shalwar [[qameez]] on state occasions and national holidays. But as Dr. Tariq Rahman writes about the European style officers that &quot;the impeccably dressed South Asian officers, both civilian and military, never wore in public till the 1970s when Prime Minister [[Zulfikar Ali Bhutto]] gave respectability to this dress by wearing it in public.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tariqrahman.net/language/The%20Teaching%20of%20Punjabi.htm&lt;/ref&gt; However, General [[Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq]] made it compulsory of all officers to wear Sherwani on state occasions and national holidays.

==Sri Lanka==
In Sri Lanka, it was generally worn as the formal uniform of [[Mudaliyar]]s and early Tamil legislators during the British colonial period. The diplomatic service had incorporated its use for formal occasions overseas.

==Modern sherwanis==
Achkans and sherwanis are worn by many Indian, [[Pakistani]] and [[Bangladesh]]i grooms as wedding dress. These garments usually feature detailed embroidery or patterns. One major difference between Sherwani wearing habits is the choice of lower garment, while in India, the dress is distinguished by their preference for [[Churidar]]s or [[Dhoti]]s, in Pakistan and Bangladesh, it is very rarely worn with churidar pyjamas, preferring a shalwar instead.

Sherwanis have been designed by [[Rohit Bal]] for [[British Airways]] cabin crews serving on flights to South Asia.

Music director [[A.R. Rahman]] appeared in a black sherwani to receive an [[Academy Award]].

A '''Jodhpuri''' suit ([[Hindi]]: जोधपुरी सूट) or '''Bandhgala''' is a formal evening suit from [[India]]. It originated in the [[Jodhpur State]], and was popularized during the [[British Raj]] in India. Also known as ''Jodhpuri Suit'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Jodhpuri sarees|url = http://www.satrani.com/indian-designer-sarees|website = www.satrani.com|accessdate = 2015-12-03|language = en}}&lt;/ref&gt; it is a western style suit product, with a [[Coat (clothing)|coat]] and a [[trouser]], at times accompanied by a [[vest]]. It brings together the western cut with Indian hand-[[embroidery]] escorted by the [[Waist coat]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hindustantimes.com/Now-bandhgala-in-a-casual-look/Article1-556306.aspx]  {{wayback|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/Now-bandhgala-in-a-casual-look/Article1-556306.aspx |date=20110830085539 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is suitable for occasions such as weddings and formal gatherings.

The material can be silk or any other suiting material. Normally, the material is lined at the collar and at the buttons with embroidery. This can be plain, jacquard or jamewari material. Normally, the trousers match that of the coat. There is also a trend now to wear contrasting trousers to match the coat colour.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Bridal shower.jpg|thumb|A bridal shower traditionally involves giving gifts to the future wife.|alt=Women sitting in chairs at a party, with a few gifts stacked on a table in the foreground.]]
A '''bridal shower''' is a gift-giving party held for a [[bride-to-be]] in anticipation of her [[wedding]].  The custom originated in the 1890s and is today most common in the [[United States]], [[Canada]], [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]].

The history of the custom is rooted not necessarily for the provision of goods for the upcoming matrimonial home, but to provide goods and financial assistance to ensure the wedding may take place.

Men are typically not allowed at these functions. But recently more men have been attending.

==History==
The custom of the bridal shower is said to have grown out of earlier [[dowry]] practices, when a poor woman's family might not have the money to provide a dowry for her, or when a father refused to give his daughter her dowry because he did not approve of the marriage.{{Citation needed|date = May 2014}} In such situations, friends of the woman would gather together and bring gifts that would compensate for the dowry and allow her to marry the man of her choice.

The earliest stories about these events have been known to originate in [[Brussels]], [[Belgium]] around 1860. A frequently quoted legend traces the origin of this practice to the 16th or 17th Century [[Netherlands]]. However, there are also parallels with many dowry practices and the United States colonial or [[hope chest]] (''trousseau'') custom.&lt;ref name=SOSBOrigins&gt;{{cite book

 | title=Something Old, Something Bold |year=2006 |publisher=Rutgers University Press | isbn=0-8135-3811-4 |chapter=Origins of Bridal Showers and Bachelorette Parties
 | pages = 21–22
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A related custom practised in medieval [[England]] was the Bride Ale: in [[William Langland|Langland]]'s ''[[Piers Plowman]]'' (§ B.II.45) there is a reference to a ''bruydale.'' This was a feast held before the wedding day, at which the bride made beer and sold it to the guests at a high price.

In the United States, bridal showers started in urban areas in the 1890s mainly among the upper middle classes.  By the 1930s, bridal showers had spread to rural America.&lt;ref name=CinderellaDreams&gt;{{cite book

 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest use of this sense of the word in print may be in the [[Grand Rapids]] ''Michigan Evening Press'' 22 June 4, 1904: &quot;The ‘shower parties’ that through mistaken hospitality the wedded couple are forced to attend ...&quot; and may derive from the custom in Victorian times for the presents to be put inside a [[Parasol#China|parasol]], which when opened would &quot;shower&quot; the bride-to-be with gifts.&lt;ref name=&quot;SOSBIntro&quot;&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Customs and gift-giving==
Many different customs have developed in different regions and social groups, but the basic format has been relatively unchanged for generations, and emphasizes traditional gender roles.  Sociologists like Beth Montemurro write that the ritual of the bridal shower &quot;socializes women into the hyper-feminized traditional wife role,&quot; with its emphasis on the future role of the bride-to-be as family cook, homemaker, and sexual partner.&lt;ref name=SOSB_PlanningGuides&gt;{{cite book
 | first = Beth | last = Montemurro
 | title=Something Old, Something Bold |year=2006 |publisher=Rutgers University Press | isbn=0-8135-3811-4
 | pages = 20, 26
}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Historian Elizabeth Pleck echoes this dynamic in pointing out that traditional shower gifts were &quot;for the bedroom or the kitchen.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Pleck, Elizabeth (2000).  ''Celebrating the Family: Ethnicity, Consumer Culture and Family Rituals'', p. 213. Harvard University Press, Cambridge.&lt;/ref&gt;  But this role is more of an homage to the mothers and grandmothers than a reflection of how the bride-to-be will actually behave in the marriage.&lt;ref name=SOSBGenderRoles&gt;{{cite book |first=Beth |last=Montemurro |title=Something Old, Something Bold |year=2006 |publisher=Rutgers University Press |isbn=0813538114 |chapter=Origins of Bridal Showers and Bachelorette Parties }}pp. 8 - 9&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the format has remained relatively consistent, there have been some significant changes.  An etiquette guide from the 1920s suggested showers should be &quot;purely spontaneous and informal,&quot; with guests arriving unannounced at the bride-to-be's home, while a planning guide from the 1950s suggests more complex themes and games.&lt;ref name=&quot;SOSB_PlanningGuides&quot;/&gt;

Showers are often held during the afternoon or evening, but not generally as luncheons or [[Party#Dinner party|dinner parties]].  They commonly take place four to six weeks before the wedding.&lt;ref&gt;Otnes, Cele C.; Pleck, Elizabeth H.. &quot;The Engagement Complex&quot;. Cinderella Dreams: The Allure of the Lavish Wedding. University of California Press. ISBN 0-520-24008-1.p. 74&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to the prior history of showers being &quot;purely spontaneous and informal&quot;, showers have not developed the same formal etiquette that has developed with respect to weddings.  Invitations may be issued informally, by mail, telephone, or e-mail.

As showers are explicitly a gift-giving occasion, everyone who attends the shower is expected to bring a small gift.&lt;ref name=&quot;isbn0-7432-4417-6&quot;&gt;{{cite book |author=Martin, Judith |title=Miss Manners' Guide to Rearing Perfect Children |publisher=Fireside Books |location=New York |year=2002 |page=35 |isbn=0-7432-4417-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;  People who decline the invitation for any reason are not expected to send a gift or otherwise participate in the party. The hosts are expected to hand over gifts, or [[Party favor|favors]]. These can be small gifts like chocolate coins that have been personalized with the name of the bride and the date of the event or a simple thank-you message.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Chocolate coins as Bridal Shower Favors|url=http://www.chocolatefavorsworld.com/blog/Chocolate-favor-world/|accessdate=29 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Food can be served at bridal showers. Treats such as cake and [[Candybuffet|candy buffets]] can also be served for guests.

Hosting the bridal shower falls to one or more close friends of the bride, often one or more of the [[bridesmaid]]s.  Mothers, sisters, and other close family members usually do not host bridal showers, as it may be seen as rude and greedy for the family to ask for gifts for their own members.&lt;ref name=&quot;isbn0-609-60431-7&quot;&gt;{{cite book

==Guests==
Guests are chosen from among the bride's personal friends, family, and other well-wishers. Men are not usually present at bridal showers.

The number of guests and their relationship to the bride varies widely.  In Canada, among some immigrant communities parties in community halls with upwards of 300 guests were normal, while other cultures emphasized intimate parties with only close friends and relatives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

In general, people who are invited to a bridal shower are also invited to the wedding ceremony.

==Prevalence==
Bridal showers are uncommon in some cultures.  In the [[United Kingdom]], bridal showers have been described as a &quot;consumerist American idea&quot; with &quot;limited acceptability&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

'''Cargo pants''' or '''cargo trousers''', also sometimes called '''combat trousers''' (or '''combats''') after their original military purpose,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Loschek|first=Ingrid|title=When clothes become fashion : design and innovation systems|year=2009|publisher=Berg|location=Oxford|isbn=9781847883667|page=107|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=7uIkDroBbu0C&amp;pg=PA107&amp;dq=combats+cargo+pants&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=wyLlUajLBYO70QX8w4GABQ&amp;ved=0CFUQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=combats%20cargo%20pants&amp;f=false|edition=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;  are loosely cut [[trousers|pants]] originally designed for tough, outdoor activities, and whose design is distinguished by one or more cargo pockets. Cargo pants have become popular in urban areas as well, since they are convenient for carrying items during day trips on foot. '''Cargo shorts''' are a [[shorts]]-length version.

==Description==
A cargo pocket is a form of a [[patch pocket]], often with accordion folds for increased capacity closed with a flap secured by [[snap fastener|snap]], [[button]], [[magnet]], or [[Velcro]] common on [[battledress]] and hunting clothing. In some designs, cargo pockets may be hidden within the legs.

Cargo pants are made of hard wearing fabric and ruggedly stitched. Increasingly they are made of quick-drying synthetic or cotton-synthetic blends, and often feature oversized belt loops to accommodate wide webbing belts.

The garments are characteristically designed to allow bending at the knee and hip, and are sewn with [[felled seam]]s for strength and durability.

== History ==
[[Battle Dress]] were first worn by members of the [[British Armed Forces]] in 1938, and were introduced to the [[United States]] in the mid-1940s during [[World War II]].  The large pockets characteristic of cargo pants were originally designed for British forces to hold [[Field dressing (bandage)]] and maps and other items. The concept was copied in the U.S. [[Paratrooper]] uniform to allow more room to hold [[K rations]] and extra [[ammunition]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Cracked&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cracked.com/funny-4539-cargo-pants/|title=Cargo Pants|publisher=Cracked.com|accessdate=19 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Variations==
[[File:Hue Vietnam Citadel-of-Huế-21 - Cargo shorts crop.jpg|thumb|upright|Young man wearing cargo shorts, Vietnam, 2010]]
'''Cargo [[shorts]]''' are cargo pants shortened at the knee.  Some cargo pants are made with removable lower legs allowing conversion into shorts.

'''EMT pants''' are cargo pants which have 6-way cargo/scissor pockets on one or both legs, each with a hidden zippered pocket on top of cargo pocket, a bellowed flap pocket with increased carrying capacity, [[Besom pocket]]s on calves for glove storage, and 3 slots for scissors (two fitted with snap closures).

{{Dress code (Western)}}
'''Smart casual''' is an ambiguously-defined dress code that is generally a neat yet [[Casual]] attire. Different localities, kinds of events, contexts, or [[culture]]s can have varying interpretations of the dress code and therefore the designation of certain clothing pieces (such as [[jeans]]) as ''smart casual'' is disputed. 

==History==
''Smart casual'' was first mentioned in the Iowa newspaper ''[[Quad-City Times|The Davenport Democrat And Leader]]'' in May 1924:

{{Quotation|align=center|The sleeveless dress with three-quarter overblouses, in smock appearance completing it for street wear, is accorded various interpretations. It is at once practiced and gives a smart casual appearance.&lt;ref name=&quot;Phrasefinder&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Martin|first=Gary|title=Smart casual|publisher=Phrasefinder|url=http://www.phrases.org.uk/meanings/smart-casual.html|accessdate=29 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

''Smart casual'' was commonly used in the last century and merged to form the term ''business casual'' in the 1950s, implying a more casual suit than the traditional, usual dark suit in heavy cloth.&lt;ref name=&quot;Phrasefinder&quot; /&gt;

==Definitions==
[[Australia]]'s national [[dictionary]], [[Macquarie Dictionary]], defines ''smart casual'' as &quot;well-dressed in a casual style&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Macquarie Dictionary|publisher=Macquarie Dictionary Publishers Pty Ltd|url=http://macquariedictionary.com.au|year=2013|accessdate=30 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Oxford English Dictionary|Oxford]] defines it as &quot;neat, conventional, yet relatively informal in style, especially as worn to conform to a particular dress code&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Definition of smart casual in Oxford Dictionaries|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2013|url=http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/smart-casual?q=smart+casual|accessdate=30 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Reference.com|Dictionary.com's 21st Century Lexicon]] defines it as &quot;of clothing, somewhat informal but neat&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Define Smart casual at Dictionary.com|publisher=Dictionary.com, LLC|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/smart%20casual|year=2013|accessdate=30 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Apparel==
Personal judgement is required to interpret the ill-defined term ''smart casual'' based on its context, theme, people, location, weather and spirit. Italian fashion house [[Brioni (fashion)|Brioni]] explains ''smart casual'' is not an issue of inventory or classification but rather knowledge and good taste to understand the environment; demonstrating that ''smart casual'' during summer in [[Sardinia]] is different to ''smart casual'' during winter in [[Toronto]].&lt;ref name=&quot;HenryBucks&quot;/&gt; An Australian freelance fashion director remarks, &quot;Smart Casual is the dress code most open to interpretation and the one least understood&quot;, and advises wearing fresher colors, lighter, softer materials, patterned, relaxed, thoughtful, less structured, clean and not confrontational apparel with fabrics like linen, cashmere, fine wool and cotton that are freshly laundered.&lt;ref name=&quot;HenryBucks&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Smart Casual – Some Thoughts|date=18 September 2011|publisher=HENRY BUCK PTY LTD|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140404202233/http://www.henrybucks.com.au/smart-casual-some-thoughts/|accessdate=29 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Smart Casual Dress Example.jpg|thumb|An example of smart casual attire interpreted by global fashion magazine Topman. Topman explains casual and formal clothing pieces are mixed and matched.&lt;ref name=&quot;Topman&quot; /&gt; This photograph illustrates the use of: (a) a dress shirt with French cuffs and cufflinks (formal); (b) a herringbone jacket (casual); (c) jeans (casual); and (d) dress/business shoes (formal or semi-formal).]]

Global men's fashion magazine [[Topman]] emphasizes the flexibility of ''smart casual''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Topman&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=SMART CASUAL: THE ULTIMATE GUIDE|date=13 January 2013|last=Anka|first=Carl|author2=Harvey, Laura |publisher=Topman GENERATION|url=http://web.archive.org/web/20131202023306/http://magazine.topman.com/category/fashion/smart-casual-the-ultimate-guide|accessdate=29 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; An individual's personality and pleasure of clothing choice defines the dress code provided that the attire is a multi-purpose outfit that is acceptable for formal occasions, [[dating]] or casual [[Party|social gatherings]]. Topman explains casual and formal clothing pieces are mixed and matched, and illustrates a ''smart casual'' outfit can include a mixture of [[jeans]], [[blazer]]s, [[sweater]]s, [[neckties|necktie]], a pair of [[Brogue shoe]]s, [[dress shirt]]s or a pair of [[Converse (shoe company)|Converse shoes]].

Norwegian and American cruise line brand [[Royal Caribbean International]] clarifies ''smart casual'' for main dining on-board its fleet.&lt;ref name=&quot;RCI&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Cruise Clothing Myth Buster|publisher=Royal Caribbean|author=Adele|date=3 May 2013|url=http://www.royalcaribbean.co.uk/blog/cruise-clothing-myth-buster/|accessdate=7 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Blazers, [[trousers]] (including [[chino cloth|chinos]]), neckties or shirts are acceptable but [[shorts]], jeans or [[T-Shirt|t-shirts]] are unacceptable for men. [[Dress]]es, casual dresses, or [[pantsuit]]s are acceptable for women.

Global women's magazine ''[[Cosmopolitan (magazine)|Cosmopolitan]]'' in [[South Africa]] interprets ''smart casual'' as the way most South African women dress for work.&lt;ref name=&quot;CosmoSA&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Decoded|last=Rinquest|first=Mishkah|publisher=Cosmopolitan|url=http://www.cosmopolitan.co.za/Fashion/HowtoWear/decoded|accessdate=30 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to work, the outfit is also interchangeable for use at large or small daytime parties, and wearing a dress shirt with elegant accessories is suggested.

Australian state newspaper ''[[The Sunday Mail (Brisbane)|The Sunday Mail]]'' in [[Brisbane]] defines a man's ''smart casual'' in a workplace and event context as a &quot;look sharp without being too formal; it's professional but also relaxed.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;SundayTimes&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Wise guys: Smart casual takes on new meaning|publisher=News Ltd |newspaper= The Sunday Mail (QLD)|first=Kellie|last=Alderman|date=September 18, 2011|url=http://www.couriermail.com.au/lifestyle/fashion-beauty/fashion-with-kellie-alderman-wise-guys/story-e6frer4o-1226140135998|accessdate=July 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; A jacket, dress shirt, necktie and jeans are demonstrated as ''smart casual'' attire. [[Piping (sewing)|Piping]] on a jacket to give it the &quot;preppy look&quot; to downgrade formality is illustrated as a polished look. Detailing, such as a striped canvas belt and white shoes with a pair of casual trousers and a [[Gingham|check shirt]], is emphasized for a ''smart casual'' look. It is suggested men have: (a) a pair of [[Chino cloth|chinos]] in any color from primary shades to pastels; (b) a short sleeve shirt in checks or a solid bright color; and (c) a deconstructed jacket in their wardrobe.

[[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]]'s [[Steven and Chris]] explain ''smart casual'' is an &quot;easy and comfortable way to dress.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;StevenAndChris&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Decoding the Dress Code|publisher=CBC|first=Steven|last=Sabados|last2=Hyndman|first2=Chris|url=http://www.cbc.ca/stevenandchris/2009/04/decoding-the-dress-code.html|accessdate=July 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jeans, depending on the workplace's context and environment, are not recommended. For men's attire, a pair of khakis or casual pants with a collared or [[Polo shirt|polo]] shirt and a blazer is illustrated. For women's attire, the stylists note the diversity of clothing options and recommend: (a) keeping the clothing pieces easy; (b) the fabrics not too dressy; and (c) the accessories more casual.

British national newspaper ''[[The Guardian]]'' attempts clarifying ''smart casual'' from a [[recruitment]] perspective by questioning various recruitment consultants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The smart-casual interview|date=15 August 2009|last=Chilvers|first=Simon|publisher=Guardian News and Media Limited|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/money/2009/aug/15/job-interview-clothes|accessdate=29 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; They responded: (a) stand out but blend in by understanding the workplace’s environment; (b) achieve a business-professional look by clarifying the attire in advance because &quot;it's easier to be overdressed than underdressed&quot;; (c) wear a smart coat if avoiding a [[suit (clothing)|suit]] to give the impression of a &quot;good entrance because it has an air of formality: e.g., a well-cut trench, worn with open shirt and neat [[Trousers|slacks]]&quot;; (d) wear accessories to &quot;show creativity and attention to detail&quot;, but keep them to a minimum; (e) smart, plain and straight jeans are acceptable; and (f) shoes should be clean and un-scruffy.

Global men's fashion magazine ''[[GQ]]'' in the [[United Kingdom]] attempts defining ''smart casual'' for a job interview.&lt;ref name=&quot;GQ&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=How to master &quot;smart casual&quot;|last=Johnston|first=Robert|publisher=Condé Nast UK|url=http://www.gq-magazine.co.uk/style/style-shrink/expert-answer-/gq-style-shrink-smart-casual-for-recruitment-dinner|accessdate=29 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wearing chinos, a blazer and white shirt to make an impression is suggested. Carrying a necktie is advisable; the author comments, &quot;it is far more embarrassing to be under-dressed than over&quot;.

Pakistani fashion magazine ''[[Fashion Central (Pakistani magazine)|Fashion Central]]'' defines a woman's ''smart casual'' look from an employment perspective.&lt;ref name=&quot;FashionCentral&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Look Smart &amp; Elegant - Dressing Secrets For Working Women|publisher=Fashion Central|url=http://www.fashioncentral.pk/beauty-style/dresses/story-966-look-smart-elegant-dressing-secrets-for-working-women/#.UaaZUssaySM|accessdate=30 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Understanding the workplace's environment and culture is emphasized, and checking the company's dress code guideline is highly recommended. ''Fashion Central'' outlines ''smart casual'' with clothes unstained and wrinkle-free with non-loud and non-bright colors that reflect the woman's age. Too fancy or too casual dresses are inadvisable as well as the use of extreme [[make-up]], such as using dark, glossy or chalky shades, or applying too much [[eye shadow]]. ''Fashion Central'' reports black or brown heels are preferred by women and advise to correctly select appropriate shoes for a workplace's environment.

A '''class reunion''' is a meeting of former classmates, typically organized at or near their former [[school]] by one or a group of the class members on or around an anniversary of their graduation, e.g. 5 years later. Former teachers may be invited as well. They reminisce about their school days and bring each other up to date on what has happened since they went their separate ways. 

Some class reunions also include a reunion class gift to the institution.

==Class reunions in film and literature==
In [[film]] and [[literature]], especially [[comedy]], [[crime fiction|crime novels]], [[Thriller (genre)|thriller]]s, and psychological suspense novels, class reunions have been a frequent device used to show the eruption of [[emotion]]s such as [[shame]], [[hatred]], and [[guilt (emotion)|guilt]] within individual characters who, suddenly faced again with their own youth, become aware that they have been unable to cope with their past. In many cases, those who used to be [[bullying|bullied]], humiliated, or in some other way mistreated by their teachers or classmates believe that now their chance has come to take [[revenge]] on their former torturers. Participants often nostalgically reminisce about their old school days or fondly remember their school [[prank]]s. Alumni are quite often concerned about how their lives have turned out when compared with the lives of their former classmates, and will sometimes feel pressured enough to go to great lengths to concoct stories about their fruitful careers, personal accomplishments, and relationships with others.

Another staple of this kind of fiction is former classmates taking up with their old flames again, either because they have changed to their advantage and developed into an admirable adult or precisely for the opposite reason&amp;mdash;because they have not changed at all in a fleeting world.

A '''Banarasi saree''' is a [[sari|saree]] made in [[Varanasi]], a city which is also called Benares or Banaras.  The sarees are among the finest sarees in [[India]] and are known for their gold and silver [[brocade]] or [[zari]], fine silk and opulent embroidery. The sarees are made of finely woven [[silk]] and are decorated with intricate design, and, because of these engravings, are relatively heavy.

Their special characteristics are [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] inspired designs such as intricate intertwining floral and foliate motifs, ''kalga'' and ''bel'', a string of upright leaves called ''jhallar'' at the outer, edge of border is a characteristic of these sarees. Other features are gold work, compact weaving, figures with small details, metallic visual effects, pallus, jal (a net like pattern), and mina work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Anshika|title=Different types of Sarees from North India, South India and East India.|url=http://www.indiamarks.com/guide/Different-types-of-Sarees-from-North-India-South-India-and-East-India-/11467|publisher=www.indiamarks.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The sarees are often part of an Indian bride's [[Dowry|trousseau]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/ET-Cetera/Saree-saga-Draped-for-elegance-growth/articleshow/4360580.cms Saree saga: Draped for elegance, growth too] [[The Economic Times]], 5 Apr 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/articleshow/42205744.cms The religious route] [[The Times of India]], 3 April 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

Depending on the intricacy of its designs and patterns, a saree can take from 15 days to a month and sometimes up to six months to complete. Banarasi sarees are mostly worn by Indian women on important occasions such as when attending a wedding and are expected to be complemented by the woman's best jewelry.

==History==
[[File:Saree on display at Dilli Haat.JPG|thumb|A traditional Banarasi saree with gold brocade]]
[[Ralph Fitch]] (1583–91) describes Banaras as a thriving sector of the cotton textile industry. The earliest mention of the brocade and [[Zari]] textiles of Banaras is found in the 19th century. With the migration of silk weavers from Gujarat during the famine of 1603, it is likely that silk brocade weaving started in Banaras in the seventeenth century and developed in excellence during the 18th and 19th century. During the [[Mughal period]], around 14th century, weaving of [[brocade]]s with intricate designs using gold and silver threads became the specialty of Banaras.&lt;ref&gt;[http://lifestyle.iloveindia.com/lounge/banarasi-sari-285.html Banarasi Sari]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rediff.com/cms/print.jsp?docpath=//money/2007/apr/21spec.htm The rise and fall of Benarasi silk trade] [[Rediff.com]], Geetanjal Krishna in Benares, April 21, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

The traditional Banarasi saree is done with lot of hard work and skillful work using the silk.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.teriin.org/index.php?option=com_featurearticle&amp;task=details&amp;sid=793&amp;Itemid=157&lt;/ref&gt; The saree making is a cottage industry for about 12 lakh (1 lakh is 100,000) &lt;!--NO USE TO ME IN ENGLAND. I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT A LAKH IS!!--&gt; people associated directly or indirectly with the hand loom silk industry of the region around Varanasi encompassing [[Gorakhpur]], [[Chandauli]], [[Bhadohi]], [[Jaunpur district|Jaunpur]] and [[Azamgarh district]]s.&lt;ref name=toi/&gt;

==Geographical indication==
[[File:Silk Looms, Varanasi.jpg|thumb|Silk [[handloom]]s, Varanasi]]
Over the years, the Banarasi silk handloom industry has been incurring huge losses because of competition from mechanised units producing the Baranasi silk sarees at a faster rate and at cheaper cost, another source of competition has been sarees made of cheaper synthetic alternatives to silk.&lt;ref&gt;[http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/articleshow/535211716.cms Varanasi weavers, prisoners of faith] [[Times of India]], MAHESH DAGA, TNN 8 February 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, after two years of wait, weaver associations in Uttar Pradesh, secured [[Geographical indication|Geographical Indication]] (GI) rights for the ‘Banaras Brocades and Sarees’. GI is an intellectual property right, which identifies a good as originating in a certain region where a given quality, reputation or other characteristic of the product is essentially attributable to its geographical origin.

As per the GI certificate, Banarasi products fall under four classes (23–26), namely silk brocades, textile goods, silk saree, dress material and silk embroidery. Most importantly this means that no saree or brocade made outside the six identified districts of [[Uttar Pradesh]], that is [[Varanasi]], [[Mirzapur]], [[Chandauli]], [[Bhadohi]], [[Jaunpur district|Jaunpur]] and [[Azamgarh district]]s, can be legally sold under the name of Banaras saree and brocade.&lt;ref name=toi&gt;[http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2009-09-18/india/28088590_1_gi-status-gi-registration-banaras-bunkar-samiti Banarasi silk sarees get copyright cover] [[The Times of India]], Binay Singh, TNN 18 September 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.livemint.com/2009/09/17215259/Banaras-saris-and-brocades-get.html Banaras saris and brocades get GI status] [[Mint (newspaper)]], Sep 17 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to this, in July 2007, nine organisations,  Banaras Bunkar Samiti, Human Welfare Association (HWA), joint director industries (eastern zone), director of handlooms and textiles Uttar Pradesh Handloom Fabrics Marketing Cooperative Federation, Eastern UP Exporters Association (EUPEA), Banarasi Vastra Udyog Sangh, Banaras Hath Kargha Vikas Samiti and Adarsh Silk Bunkar Sahkari Samiti,  had applied to the Chennai-based [[Geographical Indication Registry (India)|Geographical Indication Registry]] of [[Government of India]], in a move that was supported by [[United Nations Conference on Trade and Development]] (UNCTAD) &lt;ref&gt;[http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/rssarticleshow/msid-3381915,prtpage-1.cms UNCTAD to support geographical indication registration of Banarasi silk] [[The Economic Times]], 19 Aug 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bari bazaar in Varanasi, India, is famous for banarasi silk sarees, it has come under the police station of Jait pura. It used to be known as the main handloom saree manufacturing area but times change and it has become fully powerloom sarees manufacturing area. In this particular area there are more than 10 localities served, and population is more than 1 million. In Bari bazaar, daily money transaction is probably 50 million rupee. Bari bazaar is famous for its unique design, that is why it is still in the forefront of the developed textile market (Surat, Mumbai, Kolkata).

==Varieties==
There are four main varieties of Banarasi saree, which includes pure silk (Katan), Organza (Kora) with ''[[Zari]]'' and [[silk]]; [[Georgette (fabric)|Georgette]], and Shattir, and according to design process, they are divided into categories like, Jangla, Tanchoi, Vaskat, [[Cutwork]], Tissue and Butidar

==Environmental concern==
Since a large number of silk dyeing units in the trade use chemical dyes, which cause pollution in the [[Ganges River]], a move is on to shift to [[natural dye]]s. A research team from the [[Indian Institute of Technology, Banaras Hindu University]] (IIT-BHU) used the technique of solvent extraction and enzymatic extraction to develop natural colours from plants, flowers and fruits including [[accaccia]], butia ([[palash]]), madder, [[Tagetes|marigold]] and [[pomegranate]] (anar) &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.expressindia.com/latest-news/now-benarasi-sarees-will-be-made-of-natural-colours/240779/ Now, Benarasi sarees will be made of natural colours] [[Indian Express]], Anuraag-Singh, Nov 19, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Threat to traditional Sari weavers ===
The increasingly errant and erratic electric power supply, which leads to the electric powered looms sitting idle for greater parts of the day has made it difficult for the weavers to complete the saris in short time .consequently their earnings are effected. Also, the increasing quantities of look alike Banarasi sarees are flooding the market. These saris are mass-produced in China on massive looms and therefore retail at very low prices.

[[File:Nm toronto metro toronto convention centre.jpg|thumb|[[Metro Toronto Convention Centre]], late 2004]]
A '''convention''', in the sense of a meeting, is a gathering of individuals who meet at an arranged place and time in order to discuss or engage in some common interest.  The most common conventions are based upon [[industry]], [[profession]], and [[fandom]].  [[Trade convention]]s typically focus on a particular industry or industry segment, and feature keynote speakers, vendor displays, and other information and activities of interest to the event organizers and attendees.  [[Professional]] conventions focus on issues of concern to the profession and advancements in the profession. Such conventions are generally organized by societies dedicated to promotion of the topic of interest.  [[Fan convention]]s usually feature displays, shows, and sales based on pop culture and guest celebrities. [[Science fiction convention]]s traditionally partake of the nature of both professional conventions and fan conventions, with the balance varying from one to another. Conventions also exist for various hobbies, such as [[Role-playing game|gaming]] or [[model railroad]]s.

Conventions are often planned and coordinated, often in exacting detail, by professional [[meeting and convention planner]]s, either by staff of the convention's hosting company or by outside specialists. Most large cities will have a [[convention center]] dedicated to hosting such events. The term MICE - meetings Incentives Conventions and Exhibitions - is widely used in Asia as a description of the industry.  The Convention (&quot;C&quot;) is one of the most dynamic elements in the M.I.C.E. segment.  The industry is generally regulated under the tourism sector.

In the technical sense, a '''convention''' is a meeting of delegates or representatives.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Robert's Rules of Order Newly Revised|last = Robert|first = Henry M.|publisher = Da Capo Press|year = 2011|isbn = 978-0-306-82020-5|location = Philadelphia, PA|pages = 7|edition = 11th|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1947 [[Newfoundland National Convention]] is a classic example of a state-sponsored political convention.  More often, organizations made up of smaller units, chapters, or lodges, such as [[labor unions]], [[list of honorary societies|honorary societies]], and [[fraternities and sororities]], meet as a whole in convention by sending delegates of the units to deliberate on the organization's common issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Robert|2011|pp = 600-601}}&lt;/ref&gt; This also applies to a [[political convention]], though in modern times the common issues are limited to selecting a [[political party|party]] candidate or [[party]] chairman. In this technical [[sense]], a [[congress]], when it consists of representatives, is a convention. The [[British House of Commons]] is a convention, as are most other houses of a modern representative [[legislature]]. The [[National Convention]] or just &quot;Convention&quot; in [[France]] comprised the [[constitution]]al and legislative [[Deliberative assembly|assembly]] which sat from September 20, 1792 to October 26, 1795. The governing bodies of religious groups may also be called conventions, such as the [[General Convention of the Episcopal Church in the United States of America|General Convention of the Episcopal Church USA]] and the [[Southern Baptist Convention]].

Many [[sovereign state]]s have provisions for conventions besides their permanent legislature. The [[United States Constitution|Constitution of the United States of America]] has a provision for the calling of a [[constitutional convention (political meeting)|constitutional convention]], whereby delegates of the states are summoned to a special meeting to amend or draft the [[constitution]]. This process has never occurred, save for the original drafting of the constitution, although it almost happened in several cases. The US Constitution also has provisions for constitutional amendments to be approved by state conventions of the people. This occurred to ratify the original constitution and to adopt the [[Twenty-first Amendment to the United States Constitution|twenty-first amendment]], which ended [[prohibition]]. 

''Con'' is a common abbreviation for convention, and some conventions (such as [[DEF CON]] and [[Gen Con]]) use it in their names.

== Co-located conventions ==
When two or more conventions are held at the same place and time they are '''co-located'''.  Co-located conventions are usually in related industries.

[[Image:Brooke-Popham &amp; Wavell.jpg|thumb|225px|British military commanders [[Robert Brooke-Popham|Brooke-Popham]] and [[Archibald Wavell|Wavell]] in WW II]] 

'''Bermuda shorts''', also known as '''walking shorts''' or '''dress shorts''', are a particular type of short [[trousers]], worn as semi-casual attire by both men and women. The [[hem]], which can be [[cuff]]ed or un-cuffed, is around 1 inch above the [[knee]].

They are so-named because of their popularity in [[Bermuda]], a [[British Overseas Territory]], where they are considered appropriate business attire for men when made of suit-like material and worn with [[knee]]-length [[sock]]s, a [[dress shirt]], [[necktie|tie]], and [[blazer]].  They are considered more appropriate in hot subtropical and tropical climates than the typical heavier clothing favored in Europe. Many businesses in the West today that have a business casual policy similarly allow this kind of clothing in the hotter seasons, especially in the United States and Australia. {{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}  They are available in a variety of colours, including many pastel shades as well as darker shades.

True Bermuda shorts are not to be confused with &quot;[[capri pants]]&quot; extending below the knee. [[Shorts|Cargo shorts]] may be a similar length, but are typically baggy or less &quot;tailored&quot; than Bermuda shorts, and more typical of West Coast American and Australia fashion.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}

==History==
Bermuda shorts originated with the [[British Army]] for wear in tropical and desert climates, and they are still worn by the [[Royal Navy]]. During the Second World War there was a shortage of clothing in Bermuda.  According to Jack Lightbourn, former Executive Vice President of the Bank of Bermuda, the general managers of the two banks in Bermuda, [[HSBC Bank Bermuda|The Bank of Bermuda Ltd]] and [[Butterfield Bank|The Bank of N.T. Butterfield and Sons Ltd]] {{Clarify|date=March 2010}} were concerned that their male employees would not have suitable clothing to wear. They arranged for a local tailor to make two pairs of shorts, modeled on the shorts of the British military, for each of their male employees.  The shorts were made from a very itchy grey flannel material, and each employee was supplied with two pairs of heavy grey wool long socks to wear with the shorts.  This was the beginning of Bermuda shorts as business attire in Bermuda.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.limeyinbermuda.com/latest_news/2005/08/shorting_the_sh.html&lt;/ref&gt; In the post war period local merchants such as Trimingham Bros. and H.A. &amp; E. Smiths improved the design of the shorts and used bright coloured materials as the shorts became more popular.

[[File:Pet rock.jpg|thumb|right|220px|[[Pet Rock|Pet rocks]] were a short-lived fad in the 1970s.]]
A '''fad''' or '''trend''' or '''craze''' is any form of [[collective behavior]] that develops within a [[culture]] or [[social group]] and which [[impulse (psychology)|impulse]] is followed enthusiastically by a group of people for a period of time.

Similar to [[habit]]s or [[Convention (norm)|customs]] but less durable, fads often result from an activity or behavior being perceived as emotionally [[Popularity|popular]] or [[excited state|exciting]] within a [[peer group]]  or being deemed &quot;[[peer pressure|cool]]&quot; as often promoted by [[social networks]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Kornblum (2007), p. 213&quot;&gt;Kornblum (2007), p. 213.&lt;/ref&gt; A fad is said to &quot;catch on&quot; when the number of people adopting it begins to increase to the point of being [[notability|noteworthy]]. Fads often fade quickly when the perception of [[novelty]] is gone.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kornblum (2007), p. 213&quot;/&gt;

==Overview==
The specific nature of the behavior associated with a fad can be of any type including unusual [[idiom|language usage]], distinctive [[clothing]], [[fad diet]]s or frauds such as [[Pyramid scheme]]s. Apart from general novelty, fads may be driven by [[mass marketing]], [[emotional blackmail]], [[peer pressure]], or the desire to &quot;[[conformity|be hip]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Domanski (2004), p. 147&amp;ndash;159.&lt;/ref&gt; Fads may also be set by [[celebrity|popular celebrities]].

Though the term ''trend'' may be used interchangeably with ''fad'', a fad is generally considered a quick and short behavior whereas a trend is considered to be a behavior that evolves into a relatively permanent change.&lt;ref&gt;Arena (2001), p. 341.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[economics]], the term is used in a similar way. Fads are [[Mean reversion (finance)|mean-reverting]] deviations from [[intrinsic value (ethics)|intrinsic value]] caused by social or psychological forces similar to those that cause [[fashion]]s in [[political philosophy|political philosophies]] or [[consumerisation]].&lt;ref&gt;Camerer (1989).&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''house-warming party''' is a [[party]] traditionally held soon after moving into a new [[House|residence]]. It is an occasion for the hosts to present their new home to their friends, post-moving, and for friends to give gifts to furnish the new home. House-warming parties are generally informal. Usually there are no planned activities besides a possible tour.

==Etiquette==
It is considered proper [[etiquette]] to invite guests at least a few days, or up to three weeks, in advance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.emilypost.com/everyday/rude_situations.htm#12 |title=Emily Post Institute—Invitation Etiquette |publisher= [[Emily Post]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gifts are customarily necessary. They usually consist of something for the new house (such as a potted [[plant]], a [[vase]], or a [[picture frame]]) or something to be enjoyed during the party (such as a bottle of [[whiskey]], a [[flower bouquet|bouquet]] of [[flower]]s, or a [[gift basket]] of [[food]]stuffs). Bluebirds are often given in some countries as they are believed to bless the new house with happiness and good luck. Today it is also customary to provide bluebird-themed paraphernalia such as china. Pineapples and coconuts are also common housewarming gifts and the pineapple and coconuts have served as a symbol of hospitality and warm welcome through the history of the Americas.

In East Lancashire as in parts of Scotland (particularly [[Ayrshire]] and [[Banffshire]]) a [[frog]] is seen as a giver of good luck. A gift of a frog is often made as a wedding or housewarming gift for good luck and fertility.

In Germany, common include gift certificate, for example from a furniture shop. Guests also usually bring something to drink or a homemade dish, such as a salad or a pie.

In Western Culture in modern times housewarming gifts have strayed from the traditional to the more contemporary in an attempt to address the values of Gen X and Y who are stereotypically becoming the primary demographic in the new home owner / first time renting markets in the Americas and Commonwealth Nations.

==Origins==
The term &quot;housewarming&quot; is descended literally from the act of warming a new house, in the days before central heating. Each guest would bring firewood, and build fires in all the available fireplaces, offering firewood as a gift. Aside from warming the house, this was  also believed to repel evil spirits by creating a protective atmosphere of warmth. Uninhabited houses were considered targets for vagrant spirits, and therefore used to require a certain level of cleansing before a house was safe to be occupied by young children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=TNxiHDi51n8C&amp;pg=RA1-PA730&amp;lpg=RA1-PA730&amp;dq=housewarming+etymological&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=OO3wNQYwRz&amp;sig=28Sf35XqLomeayWVPq7gQWfBMOQ&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=nMnOTIvrNMyD5AanrdDcDA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CCIQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=An Etymological Dictionary of Modern English: In Two Volumes – Ernest Weekley – Google Books |publisher=Books.google.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2013-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The origin is from the medieval times.

==In French-speaking countries==
[[File:Goemaer detail cremaillere.gif|thumb|{{Ill|fr|Joos Goemare}} detail crémaillière (from ''Le Christ chez Marthe et Marie, circa 1600'']]

A housewarming party is called a ''pendaison de crémaillère'', literally &quot;hanging of the chimney hook&quot;. The expression comes from medieval times. When the construction of the house was finished, it was customary to invite all those who participated in its building to eat dinner as a vote of thanks. The food was prepared in a large pot, the temperature of which was controlled by a chimney hook, which could adjust the pot so it sat higher or lower over the fireplace. This hook was the last thing to be installed in the new house, marking the beginning of the thank you meal.

==Variations==
===Regional===
* In [[India]], this ceremony is known as &quot;Gruha Pravesh&quot; (गृह प्रवेश in [[Devanagari]]) or புதுமனை புகு விழா/Pudumanai Pugu vizha (Tamil) or &quot;Gruha Pravesam&quot; &quot;గృహప్రవేశం&quot; (Telugu) or &quot;ಗೃಹ ಪ್ರವೇಶ&quot; (Kannada)  literally meaning &quot;Entering New House&quot; (for the first time). In some places, they allow a cow (sacred animal among the Hindus) to be the first to enter the house, as the first part of the ceremony. The ceremony usually involves ''VastuShant'' (वास्तुशांत in [[Devanagari]]).
* In [[New Zealand]], the [[United Kingdom]], and other [[Commonwealth countries]], a housewarming party may also be known as a [[Apartment|flat]]warming party, usually in a shared living situation involving [[Roommate|flatmates]].
* The traditional [[Thailand|Thai]] housewarming is a Buddhist ritual in which monks, family, friends, and food all play important roles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.templeofthai.com/asian-food-life/blog/tradtion-and-culture/housewarming-ceremony-blessing/ |title=Thai Housewarming Ceremony – Monks, Family, Friends &amp; Food » Temple of Thai Food |publisher=Templeofthai.com |date= |accessdate=2013-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In the [[American South|Southern United States]], an old-fashioned type of party, known as a &quot;Food Pounder&quot;, is popular. Traditionally, each guest would bring the new homeowners a pound of food such as cheese, cornmeal, flour, sugar, or any other staple food needed to stock the new home's pantry. In modern times the tradition has been extended to canned goods and even fresh foods, but the hosts are still most likely to receive the basic foodstuffs needed to set up a kitchen.{{cn|date=August 2015}}
===Other===
* A housewarming party may be thrown upon completion of [[renovation]] or [[Home improvement|remodel]].
* A housewarming party may be presented as an &quot;open house&quot; where people are free to come and go during a fixed window of time on a given day.
* A housewarming may involve a [[potluck]] meal.
* Some people invite all of their new neighbors to their housewarming.  This allows the hosts to meet their new community.
* In some communities, neighbors may bring the housewarming party to the new residents to welcome them.
* While it is common to host a housewarming party within the first three months, many people wait until they are completely settled in.  The time frame is flexible, and a party can qualify as a housewarming anytime after the move-in date.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}

[[File:Laura Torrisi - 66th Venice International Film Festival, 2009 (2).jpg|thumb|[[Laura Torrisi]] in an evening gown at Venice International Film Festival, 2009]]

A '''gown''', from [[medieval]] [[Latin]] ''gunna'', is a usually loose outer [[garment]] from knee- to full-length worn by men and women in [[Europe]] from the early [[Middle Ages]] to the 17th century, and continuing today in certain professions; later, ''gown'' was applied to any full-length woman's garment consisting of a [[bodice]] and attached [[skirt]]. A long, loosely fitted gown called a [[Banyan (clothing)|Banyan]] was worn by men in the 18th century as an informal coat.

The gowns worn today by [[academic dress|academics]], [[judge]]s, and some [[clerical clothing|clergy]] derive directly from the everyday garments worn by their medieval predecessors, formalized into a [[uniform]] in the course of the 16th and 17th centuries.

== Formal gown ==
In women's [[fashion]], ''gown'' was used in English for any one-piece garment, but more often through the 18th century for an overgarment worn with a [[petticoat]] &amp;ndash; called in French a ''[[robe]]''. Compare this to the [[bedgown|short gowns or bedgowns]] of the later 18th century.

Before the Victorian period, the word &quot;dress&quot; usually referred to a general overall mode of attire for either men or women, such as in the phrases &quot;evening dress&quot;, &quot;morning dress&quot;, &quot;travelling dress&quot;, &quot;full dress&quot;, &quot;priest's gown&quot; which are white, and so on, rather than to any specific garment, and the most often used English word for a woman's skirted garment was ''gown''. By the early 20th century, both &quot;gown&quot; and &quot;[[frock]]&quot; were essentially synonymous with &quot;dress&quot;, although gown was more often used for a formal, heavy or full-length garment and frock or dress for a lightweight, shorter, or informal one. Only in the last few decades has &quot;gown&quot; lost its general meaning of a woman's garment in the United States in favor of &quot;dress&quot;.  Today, the usage is chiefly [[British English|British]], except in historical senses or in formal cases, such as [[evening gown]] and [[wedding gown]]. Formal gowns generally have a fitted bodice and a full-length full skirt.

{{Hinduism}}

'Vasant Panchami' (also called Basant Panchami) refers to the following festivals: the religious [[Hindu festival]] of '''[[Saraswati|Saraswati Puja]]''' also called '''Shree Panchami;''' Sufi Basant observed in [[Sufi]] shrines; the seasonal spring festival of Vasant Panchami observed in many regions; the '''[[Basant Kite Festival (Punjab)|Basant Festival of Kites]]''' of the [[Punjab region]];  observance in Gurdwaras as a [[Sikh]] [[List of Sikh festivals|festival]]; the birthday of the Deo-Sun God in [[Bihar]] and a harvest festival. The festivals are celebrated on the fifth day of [[Magha (month)|Magha]].

==Etymology==
Vasant Panchami has a specific meaning: ''Vasant'' means &quot;spring,&quot;and ''Panchami'' means &quot;the fifth day.&quot; Vasant Panchami falls on the fifth day of spring.

The festival is observed in the northern part of the Subcontinent. Although it is notified in the ritual calendar of South India, it is not celebrated as a household or public event but in temples as a religious festival.The same rings true of the central region of [[Madhya Pradesh]].

==Date==
Vasant Panchami is celebrated every year on the fifth day of the bright half of the Indian month of [[Magha (month)|Magha]] .

==Religious festival==

===Hinduism===

====Kamadeva and Rati====
[[File:Kama Rati.jpg|thumb|left|Kama (left) with Rati on a temple wall of [[Chennakesava Temple]], [[Belur]].]]
[[File:Kamadev temple basantapur GP (2).JPG|thumb|Kamadev temple basantapur GP (2)]]
In ancient [[Indian literature]], Vasant Panchami is associated with [[Sringara|Shringara Rasam]] and the festival was celebrated in this tradition.&lt;ref name=dilipsinh&gt;Dilipsinh, K. S. &quot;Ch.8 - The Festival of Spring&quot; from ''Kutch: In Festival And Custom''. Har-Anand Publications. Pg.98. 2004. ISBN 9788124109984&lt;/ref&gt; Celebrations today still honor [[Kamadeva]], his wife [[Rati]], and his friend Vasant (the personification of Spring).&lt;ref name=vema&gt;Vema, Manish. ''Fast and Festivals of India''. Diamond Pocket Books. Pg.72. 2000. ISBN 9788171820764&lt;/ref&gt;

During the ancient period when Vasant Panchami was more oriented toward Kamadeva, dancing girls, [[dhol]] players, and other celebrants would come to the royal Bakshi's palace to create an informal [[Durbar (court)|durbar]] with the royals. Specially made Vasanti clothes would be worn by the dancing girls and younger royal ladies, consisting of a skirt, blouse, and pink or saffron [[sari]] with tiny red square or circular dots. This clothing would be further embellished with gold and silver borders and [[brocade]] work. On the celebration day the dancing girls would collect flowers and [[mango]] leaves from the garden of the Bakshi's palace. The flowers and mangoes were arranged in brass vessels and the informal durbar would be set up. The occasion was marked by the singing of various [[raga]]s usually on the theme of love (especially songs involving [[Krishna]] and [[Radha]] or the [[gopi]]es of [[Brij Bhumi|Brij Bhoomi]]). At the conclusion of the celebration, the flowers would be sprinkled with red gulal and the dancing girls would apply it to their cheeks. They were then gifted a sum of money by the royal ladies. Today this is not practiced, and the festival is oriented toward [[Sarasvati]], however Kamadeva remains an important figure as feasts are held in his honor during Vasant Panchami,and the theme of love remains an important part of the festival with this being the most popular day of the year for weddings in some areas.&lt;ref name=&quot;roy&quot;&gt;Roy, Christian. ''Traditional Festivals: A Multicultural Encyclopedia''. ABC-CLIO. Vol.2. Pp.192-193. 2005. ISBN 9781576070895&lt;/ref&gt;

====Vasant and Holi====
[[File:Holi Colors - Howrah 2011-03-191850.JPG|thumb|Holi Colors - Howrah 2011-03-191850]]
Vasant Panchami is the first and more minor of two spring-themed festivals in [[Hindu culture]]. Vasant Panchami initiates the spring festive cycle and heralds its summation that occurs with [[Holi]].The 40-day period between Vasant Panchami and Holi corresponds with the 40 days of [[Rati]]'s penance after her husband, [[Kamadeva]] was reduced to ashes for shooting the eye of [[Shiva]] with his love arrows. Between Vasant Panchami and Holi, preparations are made for numerous burnings in effigy of the demoness [[Holika]]. Starting on Vasant Panchami, a log with a figure of Holika is placed in a public place and during the next 40 days, the faithful add twigs and other combustible material to the log to form a pyre which is lit on Holi.

In places such as Balarama temple in Baithain, the singing of [[Holi]] songs and the throwing of color begin on Vasant Panchami and continue throughout the Holi season.

====Goddess Saraswati====
[[File:Saraswati f. Strassenpuja.JPG|thumb|left|200px|Idol of Saraswati for puja in [[Kolkata]], 2000]]
Goddess [[Saraswati]] is the goddess of learning, wisdom, knowledge, fine arts, refinement, science and technology. Vasant Panchami is treated by celebrants as Saraswati's birthday.People worship Goddess Saraswati to attain enlightenment through knowledge and to rid themselves of lethargy, sluggishness and ignorance.

The story of Saraswati Puja is related to the Brahma Vaivarta Purana. Sri Krishna granted Saraswati a boon that she too will be worshipped on Vasant Panchami. After performing morning ablutions and bathing, a [[Kalasha]] is established. After worshipping Ganesh, the Sun, Vishnu and Shiva, Saraswati is worshipped. Thereafter, [[Abir|coloured powder]] is thrown into the air.This is the general form of observance of praying to Goddess Saraswati on Vasant Panchami. In places such as [[Uttar Pradesh]], prayers are offered to Goddess Saraswati and people sing religious verses to celebrate the festival. Interestingly, in Tamil Nadu and South India Saraswati is worshipped on the ninth day of [[navratri]] in the month of [[ashwin]].

=====Saraswati Puja=====
In [[Nepal]][[Bihar]] and [[East India|eastern India]], a distinct festival in honour of Saraswati is celebrated. The festival is known as Saraswati Puja in [[East India|eastern parts of India]], and as Sri Panchami in parts of Andhra pradesh [[Bengal]].&lt;ref name=vema/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=RYUaBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA20&amp;dq=vasant+panchami+south+india&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=WctDVYzwJNPfasnSgLAO&amp;ved=0CCQQ6AEwATgK#v=onepage&amp;q=vasant%20panchami%20south%20india&amp;f=false Swami Mukundananda (2015) Festivals of India]&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Bengal]] and [[East India|eastern India]], the primary focus of the day is to honour Saraswati.&lt;ref&gt;Dibakar Purkayastha (2015) LOG OUT!

======Traditions of Saraswati Puja======
[[File:Vasant panchami udit1.jpg|thumb|Vasant panchami udit1]]
The day before Vasant Panchami in [[Nepal]], Saraswati's temples are filled with food so that she can join the celebrants in the traditional feasting the following morning.&lt;ref name=roy/&gt; In temples and educational institutions, statues of Saraswati are dressed in yellow and worshiped.&lt;ref name=roy/&gt; Most educational institutions arrange special prayers or pujas in the morning to seek blessing of the Goddess. Poetic and musical gatherings are held and children are initiated to learn the alphabet&lt;ref name=vema/&gt; and are often taught to write their first words.&lt;ref name=roy/&gt; This ritual of initiating education to children is known as Akshar-Abhyasam or Vidya-Arambham/Praasana, one of the famous rituals of Vasant Panchami. Older students clean their pens and inkwells but abstain from reading or writing on this day.&lt;ref name=roy/&gt; In Bengal, idols of Saraswati are taken on procession and immersed in the holy [[Ganga]].&lt;ref name=vema/&gt;

The color yellow plays an important role in Vasant Panchami as it is related to the bloom of mustard flowers during this period.&lt;ref name=knapp/&gt; Celebrants usually wear yellow garments,&lt;ref name=vema/&gt; Saraswati is worshiped in a yellow dress,&lt;ref name=roy/&gt; and sweet [[saffron rice]]&lt;ref name=vema/&gt; and yellow [[Indian sweet|sweet]]s are consumed within the families.&lt;ref name=roy/&gt;

======National Festival======

[[File:Saraswati idol in Hindu School, Kolkata,India.JPG|thumb|Saraswati idol in Hindu School, Kolkata,India]]
Even though in many parts of India, Vasant is observed as a secular seasonal holiday, the Indian government is encouraging the observance of Saraswati Puja in educational institutions.&lt;ref&gt;Mukul Kumar Mishra (24.01.2015)  Gujarat: Circular to hold 'Saraswati Vandana' stirs controversy; Muslims express displeasure  [http://www.oneindia.com/india/now-gujarat-govt-orders-schools-perform-the-saraswati-puja-muslims-dispeasure-lse-1630387.html]&lt;/ref&gt; Directives have been issued in Gujarat and Rajasthan to promote the festival where it is traditionally observed as a seasonal festival.&lt;ref&gt;Rajasthan [district Gazetteers].: Jaipur [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=ZrobAAAAIAAJ&amp;q=vasant+panchami+in+rajasthan&amp;dq=vasant+panchami+in+rajasthan&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=haNDVdWgBIrWUciLgdgJ&amp;ved=0CFsQ6AEwBzgK]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;books.google.co.uk&quot;&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=UMAjAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=vasant+panchami+rajasthan&amp;dq=vasant+panchami+rajasthan&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=lQBKVajIC8vsUomugMgK&amp;ved=0CDgQ6AEwAThQ Journal of the Indian Anthropological Society, Volume 30 (1995)]&lt;/ref&gt;

Saraswati Puja is a &quot;great day to inaugurate training institutes and new schools – a trend made famous by the renowned Indian educationist Pandit Madan Mohan Malaviya (1861-1946), who founded the Banaras Hindu University on Vasant Panchami day in 1916.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hinduism.about.com/od/festivalsholidays/p/vasantpanchami.htm |title=Vasant Panchami: Birthday of Goddess Saraswati |publisher=Hinduism.about.com |date=2014-02-13 |accessdate=2014-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Accordingly, Saraswati Puja has grown in popularity in recent years and is associated with schools generally.&lt;ref&gt;Chaise LaDousa Hindi Is Our Ground, English Is Our Sky: Education, Language, and Social Class in Contemporary India [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=NK-2AgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA75&amp;dq=saraswati+puja+national+festival&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=hHhDVeiFCcfzPMHZgZgL&amp;ved=0CFwQ6AEwBzgK#v=onepage&amp;q=saraswati%20puja%20national%20festival&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt; The festival is fast becoming or indeed has become a pan North Indian festival.

=====Overseas Celebrations=====
The festival is celebrated by the Indian diaspora based at [[Nottingham]], UK, every year under the aegis of the socio-cultural group ''[http://jhankarnica.weebly.com/ Jhankar-NICA]''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.jhankarnica.weebly.com&lt;/ref&gt;

====Lord Shiva====
[[File:Murudeswar Shiva.jpg|thumb|right|Murudeswar Shiva]]
Vasant Panchami is also associated with Lord [[Shiva]]. On this day people pray to Lord Shiva or to the family God. Wearing yellow is not universally observed.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=AumuJ2jtRZIC&amp;pg=PA313&amp;dq=vasant+panchami+and+lord+shiva&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=UJxDVYmVD4T7UKW6gJgN&amp;ved=0CEMQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&amp;q=vasant%20panchami%20and%20lord%20shiva&amp;f=false N.

Traditionally, in [[Maharashtra]]. [[Madhya Pradesh]], [[Chhattisgarh]] and [[Uttar Pradesh]], after bathing in the morning, people worship Lord [[Shiva]] and Goddess Parvati. Offerings of mango flowers and the ears of wheat are traditionally made.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=YlqH4Q_gqCQC&amp;pg=PA27&amp;dq=basant+panchami+north+indian+festival&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=mcxEVb2hFY7Wat2-gbAH&amp;ved=0CEYQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=basant%20panchami%20north%20indian%20festival&amp;f=false R.

====Lord Vishnu====
People apply sesame paste to their bodies and then bathe. Thereafter, people wear yellow clothes and pray to Lord Vishnu. The [[Brahmin]] should be invited to join in the lunch feast, and perform ancestor worship (''Pitr-tarpan''). Once this is done coloured powder is applied and thrown into the air.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dr. Bhojraj Dwivedi 2006&quot;&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=7wmqKuHFWWgC&amp;pg=PA176&amp;dq=vasant+panchami+saraswati+uttar+pradesh&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=1c9DVd7vIcfcasWugYgH&amp;ved=0CCkQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=vasant%20panchami%20saraswati%20uttar%20pradesh&amp;f=false Dr. Bhojraj Dwivedi (2006)]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sun-Deo God===
The shrine of the Sun-God in [[Aurangabad district, Bihar]] known as the Deo-Sun Shrine, was established on Basant Panchami. The day is celebrated to commemorate the founding of the shrine by King Aila of Allahabad and the birthday of the Sun-Deo God.

[[Muslim]]s have been celebrating Basant since the 12th century A.D. According to legend Delhi's Chishti Saint Nizamuddin Aulia's young nephew Taqiuddin Nooh died. Stricken with grief, he withdrew from society. The court poet, Amir Khusrau, tried to think of ways to brighten the Saint's mood. Upon seeing local women carrying 
flowers on Basant and dressed in yellow, Khusrau too dressed in yellow and took flowers to the Saint. This brought a smile on the Saint's face. Since then, Basant has been celebrated at the [[Nizamuddin Dargah|dargah of Nizamuddin Aulia]] in Delhi and all dargah's of the Chishti order.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dargahsharif.com/CHISHTISM_BASAN.htm Chishtism.

For Sikhs, in the Harmandir Sahib, Amritsar, on the day of Vasant Panchmi, musicians start the music by singing Basant Raga. This practice continues up until the first day of Vaisakh when Basant Rag is no longer used.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sikhreview.org/march2003/moral1.htm] Dr Kirpal SIngh&lt;/ref&gt; A fair is normally held at the famous Sikh shrine of Guru-ka-Lahore in [[Bilaspur, Himachal Pradesh|Bilaspur]] district to mark the occasion of the marriage of Guru Gobind Singh Ji on Vasant Panchami.

Maharaja Ranjit Singh encouraged the celebration of Basant in the Gurdwara. In 1825 A.D. he gave 2,000 rupees to the Harmandir Sahib Gurdwara in [[Amritsar]] to distribute food.&lt;ref&gt;Hari Ram Gupta (1991) History of the Sikhs: The Sikh lion of Lahore, Maharaja Ranjit Singh, 1799-1839 [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=zwFDAAAAYAAJ&amp;q=maharaja+ranjit+singh+basant+celebrations&amp;dq=maharaja+ranjit+singh+basant+celebrations&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=lepBVe7sO4yfPeergIAM&amp;ved=0CCAQ6AEwAA]&lt;/ref&gt;

The seasonal aspects of the festival are more significant in [[Northern India]] due to the sharper contrast between the winter and the spring.&lt;ref name=knapp&gt;Knapp, Stephen. &quot;The Dharmic Festivals&quot; from ''The Power of the Dharma: An Introduction to Hinduism and Vedic Culture''. iUniverse.

In [[Uttarakhand]], in addition to Saraswati Puja, people worship the mother earth and the crops or agriculture. Worship involves people placing cowdung heaps in the fields, and keep ears of barley and wheat on the heaps.

==[[Basant Kite Festival (Punjab)|Basant Festival]] of Kites==
In the [[Punjab region]], Basant is celebrated as a seasonal festival by all faiths and is known as the [[Basant Kite Festival (Punjab)|Basant Festival]] of Kites. Maharaja Ranjit Singh introduced the tradition of kite flying on Basant over two hundred years ago, which became popular in the [[Punjab region]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=zwpMGA0HH_sC&amp;q=maharaja+ranjit+singh+introduced+kite+flying+on+basant+panchami&amp;dq=maharaja+ranjit+singh+introduced+kite+flying+on+basant+panchami&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=l9M7VZ7yPNbsaPfhgegI&amp;ved=0CCYQ6AEwAQ Camille Mirepoix (1967) Now Pakistan]&lt;/ref&gt; Kite festivals are held in cities such as [[Firozpur]],&lt;ref name=knapp/&gt; where children generally fly kites to mark the auspicious occasion. This has led to the festival being called the Festival of Kites or the Kite Festival.&lt;ref name=knapp/&gt; Children buy ''Dor'' (Thread) and ''Guddi'' or &quot;Patang&quot; (Kites) in huge quantities to fly overhead. This attracts tourism from around the world.

'''Embroidery in India''' includes dozens of regional [[embroidery]] styles that vary by region on the varied [[Clothing in India|Indian clothing styles]]. Designs in Indian embroidery are formed on the basis of the texture and the design of the fabric and the stitch. The dot and the alternate dot, the circle, the square, the triangle and permutations and combinations of these constitute the design.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hrpc.com.vn/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=46:embroidery-arts-of-india&amp;catid=6:crafts-in-the-world&amp;Itemid=13&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aari==
[[File:Handkerchief LACMA 42.33.4 (1 of 2).jpg|thumb|Cotton tambour embroidery on net. 19th century. Los Angeles County Museum of Art.]]
Aari work involves a hook, plied from the top but fed by silk thread from below with the material spread out on a frame. This movement creates loops, and repeats of these lead to a line of chain stitches.&lt;ref&gt;Sajnani, Manohar  (2001) Encyclopaedia of Tourism Resources in India, Volume 2  [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=nxtnsT8CdZ4C&amp;pg=PA122&amp;dq=Aribharat&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CD8Q6AEwBmoVChMIiNbss4TKxwIV6AjbCh1XHQ97#v=onepage&amp;q=Aribharat&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt; The fabric is stretched on a frame and stitching is done with a long needle ending with a hook such as a crewel, tambour (a needle similar to a very fine crochet hook but with a sharp point)&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=NrM1hoOlEOMC&amp;pg=PA135&amp;dq=Tambour+stitch&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CCAQ6AEwAGoVChMIsvCfwIXKxwIVC5fbCh36Ag8l#v=onepage&amp;q=Tambour%20stitch&amp;f=false Wood, Dorothy (2008) The Beader's Bible]&lt;/ref&gt;  or Luneville work. The other hand feeds the thread from the underside, and the hook brings it up, making a chainstitch, but it is much quicker than chainstitch done in the usual way: looks like machine-made and can also be embellished with sequins and beads - which are kept on the right side, and the needle goes inside their holes before plunging below, thus securing them to the fabric.

Aari embroidery is practiced in various regions such as in [[Kashmir]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=uSBuAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=aari+embroidery&amp;dq=aari+embroidery&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CEEQ6AEwAzgKahUKEwjMhaCdpb3HAhWJKtsKHfEtAWE Mehta, Vinod (2006) Delhi and NCR city guide]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Kutch]] ([[Gujarat]]).&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=PELWAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=aari+embroidery+kutch&amp;dq=aari+embroidery+kutch&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CEAQ6AEwA2oVChMIycyg5qW9xwIVywbbCh1wsAZP HALI., Issues 117-119 2001]&lt;/ref&gt;

Bright red, yellow, black and white coloured cloth is laid in bands and joined with a white criss-cross stitch. The Banjaras of [[Madhya Pradesh]] who are found in the districts of Malwa and Nimar have their own style of embroidery where designs are created according to the weave of the cloth, and the textured effect is achieved by varying colours and stitches of the geometric patterns and designs. Motifs are generally highlighted by cross-stitch.

==Banni or Heer Bharat ([[Gujarat]])==
The Banni or Heer Bharat embroidery originates in [[Gujarat]], and is practiced mainly by the Lohana community. It is done with silk floss (Heer means &quot;silk floss&quot;) and it is famous for its vibrancy and richness in color pallets &amp; design patterns, which include shisha (mirror) work. Bagh and phulkari embroidery of the [[Punjab region]] has influenced Heer Bharat embroidery in its use of geometrical motifs and stitchery.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=oNAwl-jS3gwC&amp;pg=PA24&amp;lpg=PA24&amp;dq=heer+bharat+gujarat+phulkari&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=oAeVU2p7ms&amp;sig=d2AwI5X2kZMc3WX0UgT9luwHX9I&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CCEQ6AEwAGoVChMIm6fsx8S4xwIVytOACh3_nQSC#v=onepage&amp;q=heer%20bharat%20gujarat%20phulkari&amp;f=false Naik, Shailaja D.

==Chikan or Chikankari ([[Uttar Pradesh]])==
{{main|Chikan (embroidery)}} 
[[File:Chikan embroidery on a saree pallu.jpg|thumb|left|Chikan embroidery on a saree pallu]]
The present form of chikan (meaning elegant patterns on fabric) work is associated with the city of [[Lucknow]], in [[Uttar Pradesh]]. Chikan embroidery on silk is Lucknow's own innovation. The other chikan styles are that of [[Calcutta]] and [[Dacca]]. However, characteristic forms of stitch were developed in [[Lucknow]]: phanda and murri.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=6jjHxObm8jgC&amp;pg=PA242&amp;dq=chikan++embroidery+lucknow&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CEEQ6AEwAmoVChMI7v6B8oi8xwIVYkfbCh2Gtgz9#v=onepage&amp;q=chikan%20%20embroidery%20lucknow&amp;f=false Trivedi, Madhu (2010) The Making of the Awadh Culture]&lt;/ref&gt;

Chikan embroidery is believed to have been introduced by Nur Jahan,&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=uIvWAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=chikan++embroidery+nur+jahan&amp;dq=chikan++embroidery+nur+jahan&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CDQQ6AEwAWoVChMIoYHx3Yq8xwIVxWvbCh29Ew-Z Bhushan, Jamila Brij   (1990) Indian Embroidery]&lt;/ref&gt; the wife of Jahangir. Chikan embroidery involves the use of white thread on white muslin (tanzeb), fine cotton (mulmul), or voile, fine almost sheer fabrics which showcases shadow work embroidery the best. Other colours can also be used.  
 
The artisans usually create individual motifs or ''butis'' of animals and flowers (rose, lotus, jasmine, creepers). The designs are first printed onto the fabric not with chaulk, but with a mixture of glue and indigo.

At least 40 different stitches are documented, of which about 30 are still practiced today and include flat, raised and embossed stitches, and the open trellis-like ''jaali'' work. Some of the stitches that are used in Chikankari work include: taipchi, pechni, pashni, bakhia (ulta bakhia and sidhi bakhia), gitti, jangira, murri, phanda, jaalis etc. In English: chain stitch, buttonhole stitch, French knots and running stitch, shadow work. Another is the khatao (also called khatava or katava).

==Gota (Jaipur, Rajasthan)==
[[File:Kota sari with gota patti by ashish 01.JPG|thumb|centre|Kota sari with gota patti]]
It is a form of appliqué in gold thread, used for women’s formal attire. Small pieces of zari ribbon are applied onto the fabric with the edges sewn down to create elaborate patterns. Lengths of wider golden ribbons are stitched on the edges of the fabric to create an effect of gold zari work. Khandela in Shekhawati is famous for its manufacture. The Muslim community uses Kinari or edging, a fringed border decoration. Gota-kinari practiced mainly in [[Jaipur]], utilising fine shapes of bird, animals, human figures which are cut and sewn on to the material.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=oNAwl-jS3gwC&amp;pg=PA144&amp;dq=gota+embroidery&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CDQQ6AEwAGoVChMI8Jz696a9xwIVYgbbCh177gki#v=onepage&amp;q=gota%20embroidery&amp;f=false Shailaja D.

==Kantha ([[Bengal]])==
[[File:Modern Naksi kantha.jpg|thumb|Modern Naksi kantha]]
Naksha is embroidery on many layers of cloth (like quilting), with running stitch. It is also known as dorukha which  mean the designs/motifs are equally visible in both sides: there is no right or wrong side so both side are usable. Traditionally, worn out clothes and saris were piled together and stitched into quilts. Rural Bengali women still do this with cotton saris, the embroidery thread being taken from the sari border.  It started as a method of making quilts, but the same type of embroidery can also be found on saris, salwar suits, stoles, napkins, etc. Themes include human beings, animals, flowers, geometric designs and mythological figures.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.indian-heritage.org/artcraft/designs/kantha.html Indian Heritage]&lt;/ref&gt;

Different types include Sujani kantha, Durjani kantha, Lep kantha, Archilata kantha, Rumal kantha and Oaar kantha.

==Karchobi==

It is a raised zari metallic thread embroidery created by sewing flat stitches on cotton padding.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=P_BuAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=karchobi+embroidery&amp;dq=karchobi+embroidery&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CDwQ6AEwAzgKahUKEwi0io6Wr73HAhXnPtsKHWMmBn0 Knopf, 1996 Rajasthan]&lt;/ref&gt; This technique is commonly used for bridal and formal costumes as well as for velvet coverings, tent hangings, curtains and the coverings of animal carts and temple chariots.

==Kasuti or Kasuthi (Karnataka)==
{{main|Kasuti}}
[[Image:Kasuti.jpg|thumb|centre|200px|Kasuti work on silk, © Kamat's Potpourri]]
Kasuti (Kai=hand and Suti = cotton)comes from the state of [[Karnataka]],&lt;ref&gt;Karine Schomer, W. H. McLeod (1987) The Sants: Studies in a Devotional Tradition of India [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=OkKhOivXrhgC&amp;pg=PA495&amp;dq=punjabi+kasuti&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CDwQ6AEwBGoVChMIw6e06vK-xwIVyJzbCh1rdQf7#v=onepage&amp;q=punjabi%20kasuti&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt; but also used elsewhere, as in Kanchipuram sarees.  Kasuti is done with single thread and involves counting of each thread on the cloth. The patterns are stitched without knots, so that both sides of the cloth look alike. Stitches like Ganti, Murgi, Neyge and Menthe form intricate patterns like gopura, chariot, palanquin, lamps and conch shells, as well as peacocks and elephants, in fixed designs and patterns.

==Kathi ([[Gujarat]])==
Kathi embroidery was introduced by 'Kathi' the cattle breeders, who were wanderers.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=oNAwl-jS3gwC&amp;pg=PA21&amp;dq=kathi+embroidery+of+gujarat&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CDMQ6AEwAGoVChMI8uCy_Ke9xwIVAxfbCh0hYwpE#v=onepage&amp;q=kathi%20embroidery%20of%20gujarat&amp;f=false Shailaja D. Naik (1996) Traditional Embroideries of India]&lt;/ref&gt; This technique combines chain stitch, appliqué work and mirror-like insertions.

==Kutch or Aribharat or ==
The best known of the [[Kutch]] ([[Gujarat]]) embroidery techniques is Aribharat, named after the hooked needle which forms the chainstitch. 
It is also known as Mochibharat, as it used to be done by mochis (cobblers).&lt;ref&gt;[http://thesethingscalledwords.wordpress.com/2014/03/25/indian-embroidery/ Indian Embroidery]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Kutchi bharat/[[Sindh]]i stitch ([[Gujarat]])==
A variation of Kutch work, this geometric embroidery starts with a foundation framework of herringbone stitch or Cretan stitch, and then this framework is completely filled with interlacing. It is said that this technique originated in far away land of Armenia  and found its way to Gujarat by travelling Nomads. Sindhi stitch or Maltese cross stitch is also similar but the innovation of the Kutchi women have taken it beyond the traditional designs...

==Kashmiri embroidery==

[[File:Girls in Kargil.jpg|thumb|Kashmiri embroidery]]

===Kashmiri Kashida ([[Kashmir]])===
'''Kashmiri embroidery'''(also Kashida) is used for phirans (woollen kurtas) and namdahs (woollen rugs)as well as stoles. It draws inspiration from nature. Birds, blossoms and flowers, creepers, chinar leaves, ghobi, mangoes, lotus, and trees are the most common themes. The entire pattern is made with one or two embroidery stitches, and mainly chain stitch on a base of silk, wool and cotton: the colour is usually white, off-white or cream but nowadays one can find stoles and salwar-kameez sets in many other colours such as brown, deep blue, sky blue, maroon and rani pink. Kashida is primarily done on canvas with crystal threads, but Kashida also employs pashmina and leather threads. Apart from clothes, it's found on home furnishings like bed spreads, sofa and floor cushions, and pillow covers.

The base cloth, whether [[wool]] or [[cotton]], is generally white or [[Cream (colour)|cream]] or a similar shade. [[Pastel]] colors are also often used. The craftsmen use shades that blend with the background. Thread colors are inspired by local flowers. Only one or two stitches are employed on one fabric.

Kashmiri embroidery is known for the skilled execution of a single stitch, which is often called the Kashmiri stitch and which may comprise the chain stitch, the satin stitch, the slanted darn stitch, the stem stitch, and the herringbone stitch. Sometimes, the doori (knot) stitches are used but not more than one or two at a time.

The stitches include sozni (satin), zalakdozi (chain) and vata chikan (button hole).&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=oNAwl-jS3gwC&amp;pg=PA77&amp;dq=kashida+embroidery+sozni&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CDMQ6AEwAGoVChMIy7qfjam9xwIVJozbCh1vugKo#v=onepage&amp;q=kashida%20embroidery%20sozni&amp;f=false Shailaja D. Naik (1996) Traditional Embroideries of India]&lt;/ref&gt; Other styles include dorukha in which the motif appears on both sides of the shawl with each side having a different color; papier-mâché; aari (hook) embroidery; shaaldaar; chinar-kaam; samovar (the antique Kashimiri tea-pot) is a very typical and popular design used in Kashmiri embroidery. The samovar pattern is then filled up with intricate flowers and leaves and twigs; Kashir-jaal which implies fine network of embroidery, particularly on the neckline and sleeves of a dress material.

Further styles include naala jaal which involves embroidery particularly on the neckline and chest/yoke: naala means neck in the [[Koshur]] dialect of Kashmiri language; jaama is a very dense embroidery covering the whole base fabric with a thick spread of vine/creepers and flowers, badaam and heart shapes, a variation of this form is neem-jaama, where neem means demi or half, because the embroidery is less dense, allowing a view of the fabric underneath; and jaal consisting of bel-buti: a fine and sparse net of vine/creepers and flowers. Variation of this form is neem-jaal, where again the work is less dense.

==Mukesh==
Small rectangular pieces of metal are squeezed shut around some threads of the fabric. Mukesh work (known also as badla or fardi), includes women making shiny stitches amid chikan embroidery using a needle and long, thin strips of metal.&lt;ref&gt;Clare M.

[[File:Head Cloth (Phulkari) LACMA M.64.24.1.jpg|thumb|left|Head Cloth (Phulkari)]]
[[Phulkari]] (Phul=flower, Kari=work) is the most famous rural embroidery tradition of Punjab, mentioned in the Punjabi folklore of Heer Ranjha by Waris Shah. Its present form and popularity goes back to 15th century, during Maharaja Ranjit Singh’s reign&lt;ref&gt;http://daily.indianroots.com/phulkari-sikh-awareness-appreciation-month/&lt;/ref&gt; Phulkari also means headscarf, and it comes from the 19th century tradition of carrying an odhani or a head-scarf with flower patterns. Its distinctive property is that the base is a dull hand-spun or khadi cloth, with bright coloured threads that cover it completely, leaving no gaps. It uses a darn stitch done from the wrong side of the fabric using darning needles, one thread at a time, leaving a long stitch below to form the basic pattern.&lt;ref&gt;http://daily.indianroots.com/indian-embroidery-styles/&lt;/ref&gt; Famous for Phulkari are the cities of

The emroidery styles of the [[Punjab region]] include kalabatun embroidery&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=_fQEAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=kamdani+multan&amp;dq=kamdani+multan&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CCAQ6AEwAGoVChMI27efkeS3xwIVQtkaCh0NpgFY Ramananda Chatterjee (1939) The Modern Review, Volume 66, Issues 1-6]&lt;/ref&gt;  using thin wires. Kalabatan surkh involves using gold wires on orange coloured and red silk. Kalabatan safed involves using silver wires on white material. There are two kinds of gold embroidery, one of a solid and rich kind called kar-chob and the other called tila-kar or kar-chikan utilising gold thread. The former is used for carpets and saddle cloths whereas the latter is used for dresses. The [[Punjab region]] also uses mukesh embroidery: mukesh bati-hui, twisted tinsel,  mukesh gokru, flattened gold wire for embroidery of a heavy kind, and waved mukesh, made by crimping mukesh batihui with iron tongs.&lt;ref&gt;Baden-Powell,  Baden Henry (1872)Hand-book of the Manufactures &amp; Arts of the Punjab: With a Combined Glossary &amp; Index of Vernacular Trades &amp; Technical Terms ...

Originally this technique was used for parasols, canopies and pillows for the Rath Yatra Nowadays different home décor items can be found, such as lamp shades, garden umbrellas and bed covers.

==Rabari (Rajasthan and Gujarat)==

This embroidery style is made by the Rabari&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=BdB0AgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA144&amp;dq=Rabari++embroidery&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CDAQ6AEwAGoVChMIjdHH8rG9xwIViEvbCh3C_Qcd#v=onepage&amp;q=Rabari%20%20embroidery&amp;f=false Ms. Jaslean Dhamija (2013) Asian Embroidery]&lt;/ref&gt; or Rewari community of Rajasthan and Gujarat. This very colourful embroidery style, using stark contrast was traditionally used only for garments, but now it can be found on bags, accessories, home furnishings, etc.
Mirrors of all shapes and sizes are incorporated in the embroidery, as a result of the belief that mirrors protect from evil spirits. 
Designs include not only flowers and fruit and animals such as parrots and elephants, but also temples, women carrying pots, and the ubiquitus mango shape.

This ornamentation method originated in Persia during 13th century and involves little pieces of mirror in various sizes which are encased in the decoration of the fabric first by interlacing threads and then with buttonhole stitch.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.joyfulabode.com/wp-content/uploads/HLIC/06b8a8306d1f3e827c1315df03f240e4.jpg&lt;/ref&gt;

Originally, pieces of mica were used as the mirrors, but later, people started using thin blown-glass pieces, hence the name, which in Hindi means &quot;little glass&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.joyfulabode.com/tutorial-indian-shisha-mirror-embroidery/&lt;/ref&gt; Until recently they were all irregular, made by hand, and used mercury, nowadays one can also find them machine made and regularly shaped. It's usually found in combination with other types of stitches like cross stitch, buttonhole stitch and satin stitch, nowadays not only by hand but also by machine. Mirrorwork is very popular for cushion covers and bedcovers, purses and decorative hangings as well as in decorative borders in women's salwar-kameez and sari. 
There are various types of chikan work: Taipchi, Bakhia, Phunda, Murri, Jaali, Hathkati, Pechni, Ghas Patti, and Chaana Patti. &lt;br&gt;

==Toda embroidery==
[[File:Embroidery work Kotha Primitive Tribal Community.JPG|thumb|Embroidery work Kotha Primitive Tribal Community, (PTGs) in Nilgiri, Tamil Nadu]]
The Toda embroidery has its origins in Tamil Nadu. The Nilgiri Hills, inhabited by the Todu community have their own style called pugur, means flower. This embroidery, like Kantha, is practiced by women.

The embroidery adorns the shawls. The shawl, called poothkuli, has red and black bands between which the embroidery is done. As Todas worship the buffaloes, buffalo becomes an important motif in the Toda embroidery among mettvi kaanpugur, Izhadvinpuguti and others. Stylized sun, moon, stars and the eye of the peacock feathers are used in Toda embroidery.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=BdB0AgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA330&amp;dq=Toda+embroidery+++embroidery&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CDQQ6AEwAGoVChMI48XlkbXCxwIV4inbCh3v0gz3#v=onepage&amp;q=Toda%20embroidery%20%20%20embroidery&amp;f=false Ms. Dhamija, Jaslean   (2013) Asian Embroidery]&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;br&gt;

The most opulent form of [[India]]n embroidery is the Zari and the Zardozi, known since the late 16th century, brought in India by the Moghul invaders. The word Zardozi comes from the two Persian words  Zar=gold and Dozi=embroidery. This form uses metallic [[Yarn|thread]].

Once real gold and silver thread was used, on silk, brocade and velvet fabric. Metal ingots were melted and pressed through perforated steel sheets to convert into wires, which then were hammered to the required thinness. 
Plain wire is called &quot;badla:, and when wound round a thread, it is called &quot;kasav&quot;. Smaller spangles are called &quot;sitara&quot; and tiny dots made of badla are called &quot;mukais&quot; or &quot;mukesh&quot;.

Zardozi is either a synonym or a more elaborate version of zari where the gold or silver embroidery is embellished with pearls and precious stones, gota and kinari, making this art only affordable by rich people.
Nowadays Zardosi thread has a plastic core and a golden-coloured outside. The thread consists of coiled metal wires placed on the right side of the fabric and couched with a thinner thread.&lt;br&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Gymslip.jpg|thumb|250px|Girls wearing gymslips.]]
A '''gymslip''' is a sleeveless [[tunic]] with a pleated skirt most commonly seen as part of a girl's [[school uniform]]. The term gymslip primarily refers to athletic wear; otherwise the term [[pinafore dress]] (British English) or [[jumper dress]] (American English) is usually preferred.

The introduction of the gymslip as female athletic wear is credited to Mary Tait, a student of [[Martina Bergman-Österberg]], the founder of a college for training female [[physical education]] teachers in [[Hampstead]].&lt;ref&gt;Aldrich, Richard (1998), &quot;Teacher training in London&quot;, in Floud, Roderick; Glynn, Sean, London Higher: The Establishment of Higher Education in London (3rd ed.), Continuum International Publishing Group, ISBN 0-485-11524-7, p. 233&lt;/ref&gt; Gymslips were also worn by female [[gymnast]]s and [[Athletics (track and field)|athlete]]s from the 1880s to the 1920s, as they were more mobile than traditional female attire, but still modest enough to keep the underwear hidden during sporting activity. Even in this modest attire, gymslips as athletic wear were still worn strictly out of public view.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Uniforms Exposed|first=Jennifer|last=Craik|publisher=Berg Publishers|date=August 6, 2005|isbn=1-85973-898-2|page=153}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Victorian cult of the family and the early years of female sport, published in Gender and Sport|first=Jennifer|last=Hargreaves|publisher=[[Routledge]]|date=December 1, 2001|isbn=0-415-25953-3|page=58}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When not worn as athletic wear, gymslips or pinafore dresses are generally worn over a [[blouse]] and replace a [[skirt]]. A [[blazer]] may be worn over the top. First emerging in the 1900s, by the 1920s it had become compulsory in many private, [[Convent school#Catholic tradition|convent]] and [[high school]]s, and thus became commonly worn by girls in [[UK|Britain]] as part of their [[school uniform]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Fashion Source Book|first=Kathryn|last=McKelvey|publisher=[[Blackwell Publishing]]|date=May 1, 2006|isbn=1-4051-2693-0|page=188}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although now largely replaced by modern-style uniforms, gymslips are still synonymous with [[student|schoolgirl]]s, leading to the slang term &quot;gymslip mum&quot; to describe a [[teenage pregnancy]] in Britain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Abortion in the USA and the UK|first=Colin|last=Francome|publisher=Ashgate Publishing|isbn=0-7546-3015-3|date=March 1, 2004|page=45}}&lt;/ref&gt; Well-known modern depictions of gymslips include the [[St. Trinians]] films, and less traditionally, [[Uniform fetishism|schoolgirl uniform]] pornography, a use given more public recognition when in 1991 politician [[Clare Short]] condemned the fetish, saying ''&quot;the [[Page Three|Page 3 girl]] in a gymslip may be over 16, but the imagery is clearly intended to present schoolgirls as sexual objects&quot;''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.epolitix.com/EN/MPWebsites/Clare+Short/a989e96d-5e05-4043-99a9-d3f8a5b7cb9b.htm|title=Dear Clare...This Is What Women Feel About Page 3|first=Clare|last=Short|date=April 1991|publisher=Radius|isbn=0-09-174915-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

}}
'''Resort wear''' is a clothing style, as well as a year-round fashion &quot;season&quot;. Sometimes known as &quot;cruise wear&quot;, it was collections only to very affluent customers who were expected to spend the post-Christmas/New Year's weeks in warm-weather climates.

More recently, designers, store buyers, and the media are viewing &quot;resort wear&quot; as a specialized year-round clothing style and fashion season. There are some important reasons for this. Areas such as [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]], [[Marbella, Spain|Marbella]], [[Bahamas]], [[Palm Beach, Florida|Palm Beach]], [[San Juan, Puerto Rico|San Juan]], and the [[Caribbean|San Barth and the Mustique]] Islands were holiday destinations, but they are now places of year-round living for more affluent customers. From the spectacular resort destinations of [[Dubai]], South Africa and Thailand, to the Spanish Coast, Costa Rica and the Greek Islands, resort wear popularity is growing and it is not surprising to see Hawaiian shirts being worn on the Mexican Riviera. It has become a cross-cultural style that signifies relaxation, affluence, and appreciation of nature which displays a sense of style to the wearer.

From walking shorts, [[caftan]]s and [[sandals]], to full-length [[evening gown|evening dresses]] for women and light [[dinner jacket]]s for men, resort wear is unique in its design and function.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}} Resort wear is generally made from [[cotton]], [[silk]], [[denim]], [[microfiber]], straw and [[poplin]] that are easy to pack, lightweight and breathable. They are easy to clean and look great without ironing or fuss, much like the new hair styles that are casual, yet very fashionable.

It is characterized by the &quot;nautical&quot; style, inspired by sailor and yachting themes, classic Hawaiian prints of palm trees and hula girls, brushed [[denim]] from [[San Francisco]], bright floral prints from South America, minty greens, yellows, blues and whites from the Mediterranean and natural materials and glove-weight leathers from the Caribbean. Large hats, sunglasses, open-toed shoes and innovative waistlines complete the look of sun-soaked destinations. The style has already been the subject of small runway shows in New York, Paris and Milan.

Though designers and design houses as [[J. Crew]], [[Banana Republic (clothing retailer)|Banana Republic]], [[Lilly Pulitzer]], and [[Tommy Bahama]] have pioneered the style, other leading designers are now creating resort wear. [[Chanel]], [[Oscar de la Renta]], [[Michael Kors]], [[Rachel Zoe]], [[John Galliano]], [[Matthew Williamson]], [[Anna Sui]], [[Prada]], [[Marc Jacobs]] and many other designers have shown resort wear in their collections.

'''See-through clothing''' is any [[garment]] of clothing made with [[lace]], [[mesh]] or [[sheer fabric|sheer material]] that allows the wearer's body or undergarments to be seen through its fabric. See-through fabrics have been featured heavily on [[Runway (fashion)|high-fashion]] runways since 2006.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}} This use of see-through fabrics as a common element in [[designer clothing]] resulted in the &quot;sheer fashion trend&quot; that has been predominant in fashion circles since 2008.&lt;ref name=fashionising&gt;[http://www.fashionising.com/trends/b--Sheer-fashion-trend-2009-2010-953.html Sheer fashion trend: 2009 &amp; 2010]&lt;/ref&gt; See-through or sheer fabric, particularly in skintone (called &quot;nude&quot;) colours, is sometimes called '''illusion''', as in 'illusion bodice' (or sleeve) due to giving the impression of exposed flesh.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Maitra|first=K.K.|title=Encyclopaedic Dictionary of Clothing and Textiles|year=2007|publisher=Mittal Publications|isbn=8183242057|pages=218|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=jwHv0mmIagQC&amp;pg=PA218#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mesh, web, or [[Net (textile)|net]] fabric may have many connected or woven pieces with a large number of closely spaced holes, frequently used for modern [[Jersey (clothing)|sports jerseys]].

A sheer [[textile|fabric]] is one which is [[Transparency (optics)|semi-transparent]] thin cloth. These include [[Chiffon (fabric)|chiffon]], [[Georgette (fabric)|georgette]], and gauze. Some are fine-[[denier (unit)|denier]] [[knit]]s used in [[tights]] and [[stockings]], [[dancewear]], and [[lingerie]]. It can also be used in [[Top (clothing)|tops]], [[trousers|pants]], [[skirt]]s, [[Dress (garment)|dresses]], and [[gown]]s.

[[Latex clothing|Latex rubber]], which is naturally [[translucent]], or plastics can be made into clothing material of any level of transparency. Clear plastic is typically only found in over-garments, such as [[raincoat]]s. The use of translucent [[latex]] rubber for clothing can also be found in [[fetish clothing]]. Some materials become [[Wet T-shirt contest|transparent when wet]] or when extreme light is shone on it, such as by a flashbulb.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-2135310/Stephanie-Seymour-makes-fashion-boob-camera-flashes-highlight-dress--lack-underwear.html#axzz2JffrmPI9 Sheer disaster!

During the 1770s and 1780s, there was a fad for wrap-over dresses which were sometimes worn by actresses in Oriental roles.&lt;ref name=dam/&gt; These were criticised by [[Horace Walpole]] among others for resembling [[Peignoir|dressing gowns]] too closely, while others objected to their revealingly thin materials, such as silk gauze and [[muslin]].&lt;ref name=dam&gt;{{cite book|last=Ribeiro|first=Aileen|title=Dress and Morality|year=2003|publisher=Berg|isbn=9781859737828|pages=116–117}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1780s the chemise a la Reine, as worn by [[Marie Antoinette]] in a notorious portrait of 1783 by [[Louise Élisabeth Vigée Le Brun|Vigée Le Brun]], became very popular.&lt;ref name=dam/&gt; It was a filmy white muslin dress similar to the undergarment also called a [[chemise]]. In 1784 [[Abigail Adams]] visited Paris, where she was shocked to observe that fashionable Frenchwomen, including [[Anne-Catherine de Ligniville, Madame Helvétius|Madame Helvétius]], favoured the more revealing and sheer versions of this gown.&lt;ref name=dam/&gt;

By the end of the 1790s, [[Louis-Sébastien Mercier]], observing the dress of Frenchwomen, noted that [[demi-mondaine]]s were dressing in a manner he described as &quot;a la sauvage&quot;, comprising a semi-sheer muslin gown worn only over a flesh-coloured [[bodystocking]], with the breasts, arms and feet bare.&lt;ref name=dam/&gt; Mercier blamed the public display of nude or lightly-draped statues for encouraging this immodesty.&lt;ref name=dam/&gt;

In the very late 18th century and for the first decade of the 19th, [[Neoclassical fashion#Neoclassicism and fashion|neoclassical]] gowns made of lightweight translucent muslin were fashionable.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Two dresses [French] (1983.6.1,07.146.5)&quot;.

Accessed 12 June 2012&lt;/ref&gt; As the fabric clung to the body revealing what was beneath, it made nudity ''à la grecque'' a centrepiece of public spectacle.&lt;ref&gt;Grigsby, Darcy G. &quot;Nudity à La Grecque.&quot; The Art Bulletin 80.2 (1998): 311-35.&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of transparency in women's dress was often satirised by caricaturists of the day such as [[Isaac Cruikshank]].

Throughout the 19th century women's dresses, particularly for summer or evening wear, often featured transparent fabrics. However, these were almost always lined or worn over opaque undergarments or an underdress so that the wearer's modesty was preserved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=1821-23 sheer muslin evening dress in the Victoria and Albert Museum|url=http://collections.vam.ac.uk/item/O136990/evening-dress-unknown/|accessdate=12 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=1851 white muslin wedding dress and petticoat in the Victoria and Albert Museum|url=http://collections.vam.ac.uk/item/O368547/wedding-dress-and-unknown/|accessdate=13 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=1889-92 dress of sheer chiffon and figured silk in the Victoria and Albert Museum|url=http://collections.vam.ac.uk/item/O135455/jacket-bodice-sara-mayer-a/|accessdate=13 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==20th century==

===1900s-1910s===
A fashionable garment in the early 20th century was the &quot;peekaboo waist&quot;, a blouse made from [[broderie anglaise]] or sheer fabric, which led to complaints that flesh could be seen through the eyelets in the embroidery or through the thin fabric.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Mixer and Server|year=1914|volume=23|page=35|publisher=Hotel and Restaurant Employee's International Alliance and Bartenders' International League of America|quote=Some few years back moral reformers started a campaign against the &quot;peek-a-boo&quot; waist. The &quot;peek-a-boo&quot; waist was one with an embroidered front and the objection was made because of the portion of the bust which could be seen through the openings in the embroidery.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1913 the so-called &quot;x&amp;#8209;ray dress&quot;, defined as a woman's dress that was considered to be too sheer or revealing, caused similar consternation. In August that year the Chief of Police of Los Angeles stated his intention to recommend a law banning women from wearing the &quot;diaphanous&quot; x‑ray dress on the streets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=POLICE BAR X-RAY SKIRT.; Los Angeles May Get Special Law to Prevent Diaphanous Raiment.|url=http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=F00E17FC395B13738DDDAA0A94D0405B838DF1D3|accessdate=11 June 2012|newspaper=The New York Times|date=19 August 1913}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[H.&amp;nbsp;Russell Albee]], the Mayor of Portland, Oregon, ordered the arrest of any woman caught wearing a x‑ray dress on the street, which was defined as a gown cut too low at the neck or split to the knee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=United Press|title=Chief Places Ban on X&amp;nbsp;Ray Dresses|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=eRsbAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=I0kEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4403,4431603&amp;dq=x-ray-dress&amp;hl=en|accessdate=11 June 2012|newspaper=The Pittsburgh Press|date=20 August 1913}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following year in 1914, Jean-Philippe Worth, designer for the renowned Paris couture [[House of Worth]], had a client object to the thickness of the [[taffeta]] [[Lining (sewing)|lining]] of her dress, which was described as &quot;thinner than a [[Rolling paper|cigarette paper]]&quot;. Worth stated that using an even thinner, sheerer lining fabric would have had the effect of an &quot;x&amp;#8209;ray dress&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Ladies' Column - London Fashion Notes|url=http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&amp;d=EP19140502.2.135|accessdate=11 June 2012|newspaper=The Evening Post|date=2 May 1914}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1960s===
See-through and transparent clothing became very fashionable in the latter part of the 1960s. In 1967, [[Missoni]] presented a show at the [[Palazzo Pitti]] in Florence, where Rosita Missoni noticed the models' bras showed through their knit dresses and requested they remove them.&lt;ref name=nyobit&gt;{{cite news|last=Wilson|first=Eric|title=Ottavio Missoni, Who Made Zigzags a Symbol of High Fashion, Dies at 92|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/10/fashion/ottavio-missoni-is-dead-at-92.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0|accessdate=11 May 2013|newspaper=New York Times|date=9 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, under the [[Runway (fashion)#Catwalk|catwalk]] lights, the garments became unexpectedly transparent, revealing nude breasts beneath.&lt;ref name=nyobit/&gt; The see-through look was subsequently presented by [[Yves Saint Laurent (designer)|Yves Saint Laurent]] the following year,&lt;ref name=sfobit&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sfgate.com/news/world/article/Patriarch-of-fashion-brand-Missoni-dies-in-Italy-4501342.php|title=Patriarch of fashion brand Missoni dies in Italy|accessdate=10 May 2013|newspaper=San Francisco Chronicle|date=9 May 2013|author=Franco d'Emilio|author2=Colleen Barry|agency=Associated Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in London, [[Ossie Clark]] presented sheer chiffon dresses intended to be worn without underwear.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Watt |first=Judith |title=&quot;Ossie Clark&quot; in The Berg companion to fashion|year=2010 |publisher=Berg |location=Oxford [etc.] |isbn=1847885632 |editor=Valerie Steele}}&lt;/ref&gt; The trend led to jewellery designers such as Daniel Stoenescu at [[Cadoro]] creating &quot;body jewellery&quot; to be worn with sheer blouses and low-cut dresses.&lt;ref name=nemy&gt;{{cite news|last=Nemy|first=Enid|title=No Matter What You Call It, Body Jewelry Is Made to Top Nudity |url=http://fultonhistory.com/newspaper%202/Utica%20NY%20Daily%20Observer/Utica%20NY%20Observer%201969%20pdf/Utica%20NY%20Observer%201969%20-%201451.PDF|accessdate=26 November 2012 |newspaper=Utica Observer Dispatch|date=17 February 1969}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stoenescu designed metal filigree &quot;breastplates&quot; inspired by a statue of [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]] found at [[Pompeii]], which functioned like a brassiere and were designed to be visible through the transparent shirts while preserving the wearer's modesty.&lt;ref name=nemy/&gt;

===1970s===
[[Punk rock]] artist [[Patti Smith]] wears a see-through slip inside-out on the album cover of her 1978 album ''[[Easter (Patti Smith Group album)|Easter]]''.

===1980s===
{{unreferenced section|date=April 2013}}{{original research|section|date=April 2013}}
The [[Fads and trends|trend]] for sheer fashions was encouraged in late 1980s by the [[Media manipulation|manipulation]] of [[Soap opera|television soap]] series ''[[Dynasty (TV series)|Dynasty]]'' and ''[[Dallas (1978 TV series)|Dallas]]''. [[Celebrity|Celebs]] like [[Brooke Shields]] and [[Cindy Crawford]] were the major contributors in this regard but [[Demi Moore]] was the basic source of inspiration for the popularity of see through clothing. Her movie ''[[Striptease (film)|Striptease]]'' caused a huge buzz in the fashion and fame industry. Her see-through [[lingerie]] was and still is considered as one of the best on-screen see-through appearances of all times. In the late 1990s, however, as the trend died down, stars, [[Model (person)|models]], and [[socialite]]s were attracted more by [[silk]] and [[leather]] rather than see-through. Occasional items were seen on celebrities but there was no major see-through trend in the fashion industry overall.

==Contemporary scene==
A see-through dress worn by [[Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge|Kate Middleton]], the future Duchess of Cambridge, to a charity fashion show in 2002 was sold at auction on 17 March 2011 for $127,500.&lt;ref&gt;The Age, 18 March 2011: [http://www.theage.com.au/lifestyle/fashion/kates-seethough-dress-sells-for-princely-sum-20110318-1bzhx.html Kate's see-though dress sells for princely sum]&lt;/ref&gt;

See-through materials of various kinds continue to be available for a wide range of clothing styles. See-through fabrics have been featured heavily on [[Runway (fashion)|high-fashion]] runways since 2006. This use of see-through fabrics as a common element in [[designer clothing]] resulted in the &quot;sheer fashion trend&quot; that has been predominant in fashion circles since 2008.&lt;ref name=fashionising /&gt;

{{Dress code (Western)}}
{{Not to be confused|Western wear}}

'''Western dress codes''' are [[dress code]]s in [[Western culture]] governing what garments are worn together and in what setting. Examples of dress codes are combinations such as &quot;[[smart casual]]&quot;, or &quot;[[morning dress]]&quot;.  A classification of these codes is normally made for varying levels of formality and times of day. In traditional Western dressing, for men the more formal dress codes, such as &quot;black tie&quot;, are highly codified with essentially fixed definitions, mostly unchanged for more than fifty years, while the more casual classifications change very quickly, and a worldwide or widely relevant discussion is impossible. For women, changes in fashion are more rapid.

In practical use, dress codes are either followed intuitively or enforced by [[peer pressure]], so that people wear similar clothing in the same situations. Alternatively, at more formal events where a dress code is specified, invitees wear clothes at the specified level; if some variation is permitted (for example, &quot;[[black tie]] preferred&quot;), the host will wear the most formal option to save guests the embarrassment of out-dressing him. Appropriate [[national dress]] is generally permitted, and national variations are also widely worn as an exception to the trend of uniformity with peers, often in the form of [[headgear]] (''see [[kippa]], [[turban]], [[hijab]]'').

[[File:Dress Chart (Fashion) 1902.jpg|thumb|right|A historic chart of dress codes from ''Fashion'', 1902]]

Note that the definitions listed above are the strict, traditional definitions, which may not be followed in common use. For example, ''formal'' is often used to mean any of the first four, and ''informal'' to indicate what is classified here as ''casual''.

===Formal===
{{main|Formal attire}}
Typical events: Weddings, state dinners, etc.
Note that the use of [[white tie]] and [[morning dress]] has become rare in some countries (such as the U.S. and Australia), where [[black tie]] or a [[lounge suit]] (as appropriate) is often worn to the above events.

===Semi-formal===
{{main|Semi-formal}}
Typical events: Theatre opening nights, charity balls, etc.

There is some variation in style depending on whether it is summer or winter. See [[black tie]] and [[Stroller (style)|stroller]] for more details.

===Informal===
{{main|Informal attire}}
Typical events: Diplomatic and business meetings, many social occasions, everyday wear

''[[Business wear]]'' is included in the informal category, generally consisting of a [[business suit]] and tie.  Informal dress code encompasses all suits, but not all suits are considered business appropriate in fabric, cut, or color.

==Full dress, half dress, and undress==
&lt;!--Warning: pages link to this section, so do not change this title without updating all links.--&gt;

Before the modern system of ''formal'', ''semi-formal'', and ''informal'' was as strictly applied as it is now, the terms were looser.  For example, black tie (originally ''dinner clothes'') was initially described as informal, while the &quot;lounge suit,&quot; now standard business attire, was originally considered (as its name suggests) casual wear. Before this, the principal classifications of clothing were ''full dress'' and ''undress'', and, less commonly, ''half dress''. [[Full dress]] covered the most formal option: a [[frock coat]] for daywear, and [[dress coat]] for eveningwear.  Since the frock coat has dropped out of use, the term ''full dress'' is now only applied to white tie, for which a dress coat is worn. ''Half dress'', when used, was variously applied at different times, but was used to cover modern [[morning dress]] (note that the term ''morning dress'' is fairly undescriptive and has not always meant modern morning dress). Undress (not to be confused with [[naked]]) in turn was similarly loose in meaning, corresponding to anything from a [[dressing gown]] to a lounge suit or its evening equivalent of dinner clothes (now one of the most formal dress codes possible).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://dept.kent.edu/museum/exhibit/menswear/1840-1880.htm| title = Of Men &amp; Their Elegance | author=Kent State University Museum| year=2002|accessdate=2008-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dressing &quot;Western&quot;==
A Western dress code should not be confused with &quot;[[Western wear|dressing Western]]&quot;, a tradition associated in certain areas of North America with frontier histories. For example, [[Calgary]], [[Alberta]] encourages people to &quot;dress Western&quot; during the [[Calgary Stampede]]. This includes wearing:
* a western-style belt
* a denim or plaid or striped button-up long-sleeved shirt (or, in a pinch, a solid red, navy, black, or white t-shirt plus one other Western item)
* a straw [[cowboy hat]]
* a bandana neckerchief &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tripadvisor.ca/Travel-g154913-c10000/Calgary:Alberta:Stampede.How.To.Dress.Western.html trip advisor article &quot;How To Dress Western&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;
Dressing Western is described as an homage &quot;to Western Canada's cowboy history, which is alive and active to this day.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tripadvisor.ca/Travel-g154913-c10000/Calgary:Alberta:Stampede.How.To.Dress.Western.html trip advisor article &quot;How To Dress Western&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Informal attire''', also called '''international business attire''', '''Western business attire,''' or '''''Tenue de ville''''' is a [[dress code]], typified by a [[suit (clothing)|suit]] and [[necktie]]. On the scale of formality, informal attire is more formal than casual but less formal than semi-formal. It is more presentational than [[semi-casual]], but offers more room for personal expression than [[semi-formal]] dress.  Informal should not be confused with [[casual]], not even [[smart casual]] — in loose common usage, many people refer to informal dress as ''semi-formal'' or ''formal'' and formal dress (in the technical sense — that is, white tie, black tie, and similar) as ''very formal''. The technical definition of ''informal'' is used in this article.

==Definition==
Informal attire for men consists of a [[suit (clothes)|lounge suit]], made up of a [[jacket]] with matching [[trousers]]. The suit is typically dark-coloured (with or without a pattern): gray, dark blue, brown, or black. The suit is worn with a long-sleeved [[dress shirt|shirt]], [[dress shoes]] and [[necktie]].&lt;ref name=VaTech-interview/&gt;

Informal attire for women in its strictest interpretation is patterned after the male standard &amp;ndash; a suit consisting of a jacket with matching skirt or trousers, plus a [[blouse]]. Unlike for men, however, women's informal attire is not limited to the suit and equally acceptable alternatives can exist, depending on local customs. Formal is much dressier though.

Informal attire is today considered a conservative form of dress, appropriate for all formal settings that do not explicitly require [[white tie]] or [[black tie]]. For instance, it is commonly worn to religious services and funerals, in government offices and schools, and other contexts where casual attire is not accepted but formal attire would be considered excessive. At present, informal attire is the typical dress at daytime weddings in the [[United States]], where it is a replacement for the increasingly rare [[morning dress]].

Because of its strong association with the business world, informal attire is also known as ''international standard business dress'' or ''business formal''.

==Origins==
The [[suit (clothing)|suit]] was originally a nineteenth-century British innovation in dress: seeking a casual alternative to the long, heavy [[frock coat]]s then considered appropriate business dress, men began to wear lighter coats cut just below the waist when not engaged in business.

Standard suit-making fabric is fine combed wool, with the inclusion of cashmere in more expensive fabrics. Middle-price suits are often made of wool-polyester blends, whilst the cheapest are made entirely of polyester fabric.

This business suit (also known as the &quot;sack suit&quot; in [[North America]], commonly by [[Brooks Brothers]]) became the standard business daywear for all men who were not engaged in physical labor. The waistcoat (British) or [[vest]] (American) was worn regularly with the suit up to [[World War II]], but is rarely seen today, due to central heating in offices and the expense of construction. Until at least the early 1960s it was common to wear a hat.

In general, business suits are characterized by three styles and a fourth fusion style. English suits are noted for having a &quot;touch fit&quot; to the wearer's body shape and carefully made padded shoulders. Italian suits are often slimmer, with higher armholes and highly shaped to complement a slim physique. Traditional American suits have lightly padded shoulders and loose natural fit with minimal shaping. Since the 1960s, designer brands (especially Polo Ralph Lauren) have created fusion style that brings a more shaped European look to the natural American cut.

Suits in Britain were often made in [[Tweed (cloth)|tweed]], often with three pieces, and were worn outside the [[City of London]].  Tweed is made from uncombed wool, and, like all fabrics from the time, was thick and durable (18oz. was considered medium-weight in the Edwardian era).  A full tweed suit is less common today, with just tweed [[sports jacket]]s more often worn, but is still used generally as everyday wear by some, and for outdoor sports such as shooting and angling.  It is worn with appropriate accompanying clothes, much as any other suit; brown full brogues and wool ties are common items not worn with other types of suit.

[[Coco Chanel]] pioneered the [[Femininity|feminine]] suit in the early 20th century.

==Usage in the workplace==
{{recentism|section|date=October 2011}}
Most men do not wear suits in their everyday lives.  They wear [[uniform]]s, or other inexpensive, sturdy clothing that can be easily laundered.  Wearing a suit to work daily is often an indication of [[Management|managerial]] or professional status.  However, when on a [[job interview]] or attending business [[meeting]]s, many men who do not otherwise wear suits, will dutifully wear them as a mark of respect and formality.  Many how-to books for men recommend wearing a conservatively styled suit to an employment interview even when the man does not expect to ever wear a suit on the job.&lt;ref name=VaTech-interview&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.career.vt.edu/Interviewing/InterviewAppearance.html | title = Interview appearance and attire | work = Career services | publisher = Virginia Tech, Division of Student Affairs | date =  10 July 2013 | accessdate = 25 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1990s, [[Internet]] businesses flourished and so did the relaxed dress standards enjoyed by unconventional [[Dot-com company|dot-com]] businesspeople. A new form of attire had arisen, [[business casual]], which consists of nice [[trousers]], often [[chinos]] or [[khakis]], and a [[polo shirt]] or short-sleeved shirt. Today this is acceptable and common attire at technically oriented business meetings and in semiprofessional settings, and is continuing to gain ground over traditional business attire.

The standard for women is also in flux. In the 1970s, women aspiring to managerial or professional status were advised to &quot;dress for success&quot; by wearing clothing that imitated the male business suit: jacket and matching skirt, worn with a plain blouse and discreet accessories. The plain blouse is designated as a long sleeve button down shirt tucked properly into the skirt at the waist. Some women wore [[pantsuit]]s, substituting pants for the skirt, but in doing so, they risked the displeasure of many who felt that women should not wear pants.

Now even conservative [[Western world|Western]] workplaces are more accepting of pants on female employees.  However, they may still expect female employees to exhibit the formality of men's suits.  Women in &quot;creative&quot; professions, such as advertising, web design, or fashion, can usually dress with more color and flair.

&lt;!--  Commented out because image was deleted: [[Image:Thorbjorgolfsson.jpg|thumb|A fashionable suit and tie denotes the entrepreneur]] --&gt;
Male business attire is also nuanced.  Choice of clothing and accessories proclaims social and financial status.  An inexpensive [[ready-to-wear]] suit will lack the cachet of a [[bespoke]] suit fashioned by a famous [[tailor]].  Custom shirts, hand-made leather shoes, fine [[cuff link]]s and expensive [[watch]]es may indicate wealth, and in certain professions may effectively amount to a &quot;dress code&quot; (e.g., in [[investment bank]]ing).

Western business wear is standard in many workplaces around the globe, even in countries where the usual daily wear may be a distinctive national costume.

Some non-Western business-people will wear national costume nonetheless. A [[Saudi Arabia]]n [[sheikh]] may wear the traditional robes and headdress to an international conference; [[United Arab Emirates]] diplomats in particular are noted for attending conventions of the [[United Nations General Assembly]] in full [[keffiyeh]] and [[thawb]]. Diplomats of the [[People's Republic of China]] are similarly noted for wearing the [[Mao suit]] to international events; [[India]]n leaders often wear [[Nehru jacket]]s, with [[Manmohan Singh]] wearing a suit-like combination including such a jacket with his [[Sikhism|Sikh]] [[turban]]. Wearing national costume in such contexts can proclaim national pride, or just extremely high status which allows the wearer to defy convention. Sometimes an element of the national costume such as a [[hat]] is combined with a Western business suit; for instance, [[Yasser Arafat]] was noted for wearing the aforementioned kaffiyeh with a Western-style [[military uniform]], a derivative of the suit.

The [[aloha shirt]], while considered casual attire in the mainland United States, is considered acceptable business wear in [[Hawaii]], where it is well-suited to that state's warm and humid climate. Similarly, ''Kariyushi style'' attire is encouraged in Japan, especially southern locales of Japan, to allow more comfort in the workplace, and to encourage dress that conforms with [[Cool Biz campaign|Cool Biz]] guidelines. Akihiko Higa, a researcher of Kaiho Soken who has worked on a Kariyushi style project for an Okinawan clothing manufacturer, said, “It (the [[Kariyushi shirt]]) is easy-to-wear and highly functional for wearing either in an office situation or in a resort.&quot;

{{Dress code (Western)}}

'''Sportswear''' or '''activewear''' is [[clothing]], including [[footwear]], worn for [[sport]] or [[physical exercise]]. Sport-specific clothing is worn for most sports and physical  exercise, for practical, comfort or safety reasons.

Typical sport-specific garments include [[shorts]], [[tracksuit]]s, [[T-shirt]]s, [[tennis shirt]]s and [[polo shirt]]s. Specialized garments include [[wet suit]]s (for [[human swimming|swimming]], [[diving]] or [[surfing]]), [[ski suit]]s (for [[skiing]]) and [[leotards]] (for [[gymnastics]]). Sports footwear include [[athletic shoe|trainers]]. It also includes some underwear, such as the [[jockstrap]] and [[sports bra]]. Sportswear is also at times worn as [[casual]] [[fashion]] clothing.

For most sports the athletes wear a combination of different items of clothing, e.g. [[sport shoe]]s, [[trousers|pants]] and [[shirt]]s. In some sports, protective gear may need to be worn, such as [[helmet]]s or [[American football]] body armour.

==Functional considerations==

[[Image:Leotard ballet.jpg|125px|thumb|left|A child ballet dancer wearing the ubiquitous leotard.]]
Sportswear is typically designed to be lightweight so as not to encumber the wearer. The best athletic wear for some forms of exercise, for example [[cycling]], should not create drag or be too bulky.

On the other hand, sportswear should be loose enough so as not to restrict movement. Some sports have specific style requirements, for example the [[keikogi]] used in [[karate]]. Various physically dangerous sports require protective gear, e.g. for [[fencing]], [[American football]], or [[ice hockey]].

Standardized sportswear may also function as a uniform. In team sports the opposing sides are usually identified by the colors of their clothing, while individual team members can be recognized by a back number on a shirt.

In some sports, specific items of clothing are worn to differentiate roles within a team. For example, in [[volleyball]], the [[volleyball#libero|libero]] (a specialist in defensive play) wears a different colour to that of their team mates. In sports such as [[soccer]] and [[Gaelic Athletic Association|GAA]] codes, a contrasting colour or pattern is worn by the goalkeeper. In other sports, clothing may indicate the current status or past achievements of a participant. In cycling disciplines, the [[rainbow jersey]] indicates the current world champion, and in major road cycling races, [[cycling jersey|jersey]]s of particular colours are worn by the race leader and leaders of auxiliary classifications.

[[Spandex]] is the preferred material for [[form-fitting]] sportswear, such as used in wrestling, [[track &amp; field]], dance, gymnastics, [[speed skating]], and [[Human swimming|swimming]].

==Thermal properties==
Sportswear design must consider the [[thermal insulation]] needs of the wearer. In hot situations, sportswear should allow the wearer to stay cool; while in cold situations, sportswear should help the wearer to stay warm.

Sportswear should also be able to transfer sweat away from the skin, using, for example, moisture transferring fabric. [[Spandex]] is a popular material used as base layers to soak up sweat. For example, in activities such as [[skiing]] and [[mountain climbing]] this is achieved by using layering: moisture transferring(moisture wiking) materials are worn next to the skin, followed by an insulating layer, and then wind and water resistant shell garments.

==Moisture-wicking fabrics==
[[Image:MoistureTransferringFabric.jpg|thumb|right|Moisture transferring fabric]]
Moisture-wicking fabrics are a class of hi-tech fabrics that provide moisture control for an athlete's skin. They move perspiration away from the body to the fabric's outer surface where it can evaporate. These fabrics typically are soft, lightweight, and stretchy—in other words, they are perfectly suited for making activewear. Moisture-wicking means that the fabric is absorbent and this can leave a barrier of wet fabric on your skin. Drywicking is the newest variation of moisture wicking. It is a smart two tier fabric that breaks the surface tension of sweat and propels it through the hydrophobic layer into a natural wicking outer layer like cotton where it is assisted by evaporative cooling leaving your skin absolutely dry. Besides the fact that your body can perform better, it will chemically free prevent odors because a bacteria microclimate cannot grow on dry skin. This broad category of fabrics is used to make garments like T-shirts, sports bras, running and cycling jerseys, socks, tracksuits, and polo-style shirts for any physical activity where the goal is to keep your skin as cool and dry as possible. Moisture-wicking fabrics are used to make apparel for outdoor activities such as hiking, fishing, mountain biking, snow skiing, and mountain climbing. Due to the popularity of garments made from these fabrics, more variations are being introduced to the market.

==Golf attire==

Golf has a long tradition of specialized attire—attire that reflects the tradition of Scottish aristocrats taking in fresh air while walking around the golf course, swinging their golf clubs, and exercising in a refined, genteel sort of way.  Golf attire though, is also being influenced by modern fabrics and trends that stress function and durability.  Golfers, like athletes in other sports, are athletes first, and public figures second.  Athletes in all sports are showing a preference for moisture-wicking fabrics, crisp details, and modern fashionable colors.

==Sales trends for activewear==
[[Image:Workout Wagga girls warming up the competitors before the start of the Lake to Lagoon.jpg|thumb|220 px|Two young women dressed in colorful jogging attire]]
As activewear becomes more fashionable and more popular with consumers, sales have increased.  Total U.S. sales of men's and women's activewear rose by 3.2% in the 12 months ending in March 2011 compared with the previous period, to $48.6 billion, according to consumer tracking firm NPD Group Inc.&lt;ref name=crainsnewyork1&gt;{{cite web|last=Pasquarelli|first=Adrianne|title=Activewear makes it onto the runway|url=http://www.crainsnewyork.com/article/20110710/SUB/307109990|work=Crain's New York Business|accessdate=26 October 2013|date=10 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; For all of 2011, activewear sales increased 6.7% from 2010, compared with women's apparel gains in 2011 of 3.1%, also according to NPD Group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://articles.southbendtribune.com/2012-10-15/business/34479799_1_lululemon-athletica-sales-associates-chicago-marathon |title=Activewear sales up - South Bend Tribune |publisher=Articles.southbendtribune.com |date=2012-10-15 |accessdate=2013-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some analysts attribute the growth in sales to an intrinsic change in the way activewear is designed.  “Historically, what had been available to women were items based on a men's item that were just made smaller and turned a flattering color like pink,” said Scott Key, senior vice president and general manager of Athleta. “Women athletes expected more.” 
&lt;ref name=&quot;crainsnewyork1&quot;/&gt;  Designers have recognized this &quot;crossover&quot; between exercise and fashion as a major opportunity for growth. It also syncs nicely with the overall trend in American fashion towards a more casual style of dress. The trend has been so popular that it has spawned a new cateogory of casual clothing, [[athleisure]].  Rebecca Minkoff is one of the fashion designers who has an entire collection designed around the athleisure concept.

'''Churidars'''  ({{lang-hi|चुडीदार}})({{lang-ur|{{Nastaliq|'''چُوڑی دار'''}}}}), ({{lang-pa|ਚੂੜੀਦਾਰ}}), or more properly '''churidar pyjamas''' (ਚੂੜੀਦਾਰ ਪਜਾਮਾ), are tightly fitting trousers worn by both men and women in South Asia. Churidars are a variant of the common [[Salwar kameez|salwar]] pants. Salwars are cut wide at the top and narrow at the ankle. Churidars narrow more quickly, so that contours of the leg are revealed.  They are usually cut on the [[Bias (textile)|bias]], making them naturally stretchy. Stretch is important when pants are closefitting. They are also longer than the leg and sometimes finish with a tightly fitting buttoned cuff at the ankle. The excess length falls into folds and appears like a set of bangles resting on the ankle (hence 'churidar'; 'churi': bangle, 'dar': like). When the wearer is sitting, the extra material is the &quot;ease&quot; that makes it possible to bend the legs and sit comfortably.  The word ''churidar'' is from Hindi and made its way into English only in the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;Hawkins, R. E.  1984.  ''Common Indian words in English''.  Oxford University Press, New Delhi.&lt;/ref&gt; Earlier, tight fitting churidar-like pants worn in India were referred to by the British as ''Moghul breeches'', ''long-drawers'', or ''mosquito drawers.''&lt;ref name=hobson-jobson&gt;Yule, Henry and A. C. Burnell.  1903.  ''Hobson-Jobson: A Glossary of Colloquial Anglo-Indian Words and Phrases, and of Kindred Terms, Etymological, Historical, Geographical and Discursive.  London: John Murray.  1021 pages.&lt;/ref&gt;

The churidar is usually worn with a ''[[kameez]]'' (tunic) by women or a ''[[kurta]]'' (a loose overshirt) by men, or they can form part of a bodice and skirt ensemble.

A '''music festival''' is a [[festival]] oriented towards [[music]] that is sometimes presented with a theme such as [[musical genre]], [[nationality]] or locality of musicians, or [[holiday]]. They are commonly held outdoors, and are often inclusive of other attractions such as food and merchandise vending, [[performance art]], and social activities. Many festivals are annual, or repeat at some other interval. Some, including many [[rock festivals]], are held only once. Some festivals are organized as for-profit concerts and others are benefits for a specific cause. Another type of music festival is the educative type, organized annually in local communities, regionally or nationally, for the benefit of amateur [[musician]]s of all ages and grades of achievement.

==History==

[[File:Leigo Järvemuusika 2007.jpg|left|thumb|280px|Leigo Järvemuusika 2007]]
The [[Pythian Games]] at [[Delphi]] included musical performances, and may be one of the earliest festivals known.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/485272/Pythian-Games Pythian Games], ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Middle Ages]] festivals were often held as competitions.

Another type of music festival is the educative type, organized annually in local communities, regionally or nationally, for the benefit of amateur musicians of all ages and grades of achievement. While entrants perform prepared pieces in the presence of an audience which includes competitors, the essential feature of this type of festival is that each participant receives verbal and written feedback, there and then, from a highly qualified, professional adjudicator—someone whom they might never meet in any other way. They also usually receive a certificate, classified according to merit, and some may win trophies. The competitive element is often played down, however, as the important aspect is that participants can learn from one another. Such festivals aim to provide a friendly and supportive platform for musicians to share in the excitement of making music. For many they provide a bridge between lessons &amp; examinations and performing confidently in public.

[[Milwaukee]], [[Wisconsin]]'s 11-day event, [[Summerfest]], promotes itself as &quot;The World's Largest Music Festival&quot;, a title certified by the [[Guinness World Records]] and held since 1999. Operating annually since 1968, the festival attracts between 800,000 and 1,000,000 people each year, and hosts over 800 musical acts.&lt;ref name=evan&gt;{{cite news|last=Rytlewski|first=Evan|title=Summerfest Attendance Was Up This Year, Which You Probably Guessed|url=http://expressmilwaukee.com/blog-9416-summerfest-attendance-was-up-this-year-which-you-p.html|newspaper=Express Milwaukee|date=11 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Fun in the Sun|url=http://www.mymidwestmagazine.com/2007/05/01/fun-in-the-sun/|newspaper=My Midwest Magazine|date=1 May 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Woodstock Festival]] in 1969 drew nearly 500,000 attendees, and the Polish spin-off [[Przystanek Woodstock]] drew 700,000 in 2011.

In [[clothing]], a '''train''' describes the long back portion of a [[skirt]], [[overskirt]], or [[Dress (garment)|dress]] that trails behind the wearer. It is a common part of a woman's [[Court uniform and dress in the United Kingdom|court dress]], formal [[evening gown]]s or [[wedding dress]].

In the [[Roman Catholic Church]] the [[cappa magna]] (literally, &quot;great cape&quot;), a form of mantle, is a voluminous ecclesiastical vestment with a long train.  [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|Cardinals]], [[bishop]]s, and certain other honorary [[prelate]]s are entitled to wear the ''cappa magna''.

==Types of train==

===Fashion===

* '''Court train''' - Worn for formal court occasions, the court train had to fall in with strict dress codes which differed from court to court. For example, the French court code set in 1804 by [[Jean-Baptiste Isabey]] prescribed a four-inch maximum width for embroidered train borders for non-Royal wearers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Court train (manteau de cour), ca. 1809|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/works-of-art/32.35.10|website=Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History|publisher=The Metropolitan Museum of Art|accessdate=18 June 2014|date=October 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Double train''' - Two trains attached to the same dress, or a single train divided into two trails.
* '''Fishtail train''' - A train popular at various times from the 1870s onwards, flaring out from mid-way down a close-fitting skirt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Watt|first1=Judith|title=Fashion. The definitive history of costume and style.|date=2012|publisher=Dorling Kindersley|location=London|isbn=9781405398794|page=200|edition=1. publ.|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=bSVo979KR_gC&amp;pg=PA200}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wedding dress===

Trains in modern (20th and 21st century) bridal wear have their own terminology:
* '''Cathedral train''' - also known as a '''monarch train''', this can measure up to eight feet (2.4 metres). A '''royal cathedral train''' is considered the longest, most formal train, measuring up to ten feet (3 metres) or more.&lt;ref name=shimer&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shimer|first1=Elizabeth|title=The wedding gown book : how to find the gown that perfectly fits your body, personality, style, and budget|date=2004|publisher=Quarry Books|location=Gloucester, Mass.|isbn=1592530664|page=44|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=0-1ZHUTcpVYC&amp;pg=PA44|accessdate=6 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=hagen&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hagen|first1=Shelly|title=The everything wedding book : the ultimate guide to planning the wedding of your dreams|date=2004|publisher=Adams Media|location=Avon, Mass.|isbn=1593371268|page=117|edition=3rd|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=fNQ3Q1M3kOUC&amp;pg=PT117}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Chapel train''' - a medium length train up to five feet (1.1 to 1.5 metres) long.&lt;ref name=shimer/&gt;
* '''Court train''' - in bridal terminology, a court train is a narrow train extending 1 metre behind.&lt;ref name=shimer/&gt;
* '''Sweep train''' - a short train that does not necessarily reach the floor.&lt;ref name=shimer/&gt; It is so called because it might just sweep the ground.&lt;ref name=hagen/&gt;
* '''Watteau train''' - a modern version of the pleated backs (called 'Watteau pleats') seen in 18th century [[sack-back gown]]s.&lt;ref name=shimer/&gt;

'''Clubwear''' is provocative, revealing, or [[Fetish fashion|fetish]] clothing that is worn to [[nightclub]]s featuring a sensual atmosphere with a very relaxed [[dress code]]. There are various types of clothing items that could be worn to clubs based on the location of the club, the club's dress code and the weather.

Clubwear in the US and UK usually consists of things like [[Ballet tutu|tutus]], white gloves, [[boiler suit]]s, [[romper]]s, [[bikini]] sets, high visibility vests and trousers and fluffy or furry [[leg warmer]]s. This type of clubwear is usually found at [[rave]]s, big dance events and nightclubs dedicated to rave/[[dance music]].

[[File:EsmoquinSombra.jpg|upright|thumb|A double-breasted dinner [[Suit (clothing)|suit]]]]
A '''dinner jacket''' (British English) or '''tuxedo''' ([[American English]], also colloquially known as “tux”), '''dinner suit''',  or '''DJ''' is a formal evening [[Suit (clothing)|suit]] distinguished primarily by [[satin]] or [[grosgrain]] facings on the jacket's [[lapel]]s and buttons and a similar stripe along the outseam of the trousers.

The suit is typically black or midnight blue and commonly worn with a formal shirt, shoes and other accessories, most traditionally in the form prescribed by the [[black tie]] dress code.&lt;ref&gt;''Random House Unabridged Dictionary, Second Edition'', Stuart Berg Flexner and Lenore Crary Hauck, editors, Random House, New York (1993).&lt;/ref&gt; In Britain a tuxedo is a white dinner jacket.

[[File:Dinner Jackets, 1898..jpg|thumb|upright|Illustration of English peaked lapel and shawl collar dinner jackets, 1898.  As substitutes for tailcoats, dinner jackets were originally worn with [[white tie|full dress]] accessories]]

==Etymology==

The term was capitalized until the 1930s and at first referred only to the jacket.&lt;ref name=&quot;auto&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.blacktieguide.com/History/04-Victorian_Late_Etiquette_&amp;_DJ.htm |title=History: Late Victorian Era |publisher=Black Tie Guide |date= |accessdate=2011-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;  When the jacket was later paired with its own unique trousers and accessories in the 1900s the term began to be associated with the entire suit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://blog.blacktieguide.com/2013/11/27/tux-britannia/ |title=Tux Britannia |publisher=Black Tie Blog }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In French, Italian, Portuguese, German, Polish, Russian and other European languages the jacket is called a ''smoking'' and in Spanish it is an ''esmoquin''. This name is in reference to the jacket’s early similarity to Victorian [[smoking jacket]]s.

The suit with accompanying accessories is sometimes nicknamed a ''penguin suit'' given its resemblance to the bird's black body and white chest. Other slang terms include ''monkey suit'' and, since 1918, ''soup and fish''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Korach|first1=Myron|last2=Mordock|first2=John|title=Common Phrases: And Where They Come From|publisher=Globe Pequot|isbn=1599216833|pages=167, 182|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=sm0TCk5fSpYC&amp;pg=PA167}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ayto|first1=John|last2=Simpson|first2=John|title=The Oxford dictionary of modern slang|date=2010|publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=9780199232055 |page=296| edition=2nd |url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=KT-cAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA296}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hollander|first1=Anne|title=Seeing through clothes|date=1993|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley|isbn=9780520082311|page=384|edition=1.

==History==

===English origins===
In the 1860s, the increasing popularity of outdoor activities among the British middle and upper classes led to a corresponding increase in the popularity of the casual [[lounge suit]] (standard ''suit'' in American English) as a country alternative to the more formal day wear that was traditionally worn in town. Men also sought a similar alternative to the formal evening [[tailcoat]] (then known as a &quot;dress coat&quot;) worn every evening.&lt;ref name=&quot;auto&quot;/&gt;

The earliest record of a tailless coat being worn with evening wear is a blue silk [[smoking jacket]] and matching trousers ordered by the [[Prince of Wales]] (later [[Edward VII|Edward VII of the United Kingdom]]) from [[Savile Row]] tailors [[Henry Poole &amp; Co.]]  It was tailored for use at Sandringham, the Prince’s informal country estate and was described as a smoking jacket.&lt;ref name=&quot;auto&quot;/&gt;

Other accounts of the Prince’s experimentation appear around 1885 variously referring to &quot;a garment of many colours, such as was worn by our ancestors&quot; and &quot;short garments coming down to the waist and made on the model of the military men’s jackets.&quot; The garment as we know it (suit jacket with tailcoat finishes) was first described around the same time and often associated with [[Cowes]], an English seaside resort and centre of British yachting that was closely associated with the Prince. It was originally intended for warm weather use but soon spread to informal or stag winter occasions. As it was simply an evening tailcoat substitute, it was worn with all the same accoutrements as the tailcoat including the trousers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://blog.blacktieguide.com/2013/11/08/tuxedo-origins-english-beginnings/ |title=Tuxedo Origins: English Beginnings |publisher=Black Tie Blog }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Introduction to North America===
The earliest references to a dress coat substitute in America are from the summer and fall of 1886 and, like the British references from this time, vary between waist-length mess-jacket style and the conventional suit jacket style.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://blog.blacktieguide.com/2013/11/10/tuxedo-origins-the-tailless-dress-coat-puzzle//  |title=Tuxedo Origins: The Tailless Tailcoat Puzzle |publisher=Black Tie Blog  }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The most famous reference originates from [[Tuxedo Park, New York|Tuxedo Park]], an upstate New York countryside enclave for Manhattan's wealthiest citizens.  A son of one of the community’s founders, Griswold Lorillard, and his friends were widely reported in society columns for showing up at the club’s first Autumn Ball in October 1886 wearing &quot;a tailless dress coat&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;reprinted in {{cite web|url=http://www.archive.org/details/sagaofamericanso008728mbp |title=The Saga Of American Society: A Record Of Social Aspiration 1607-1937 |year=1937 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although it is not known whether this garment was a mess jacket or a conventional dinner jacket, it no doubt cemented the tailcoat substitute's association with Tuxedo Park in the mind of the public.

An essay in the Tuxedo Park archives&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.tpfyi.com/events/JES-PRINCE%20&amp;%20MRS.%20POTTER003.pdf   |title=The Prince and Mrs. Potter |publisher=Tuxedo Park FYI  }}&lt;/ref&gt; attributes the jacket's importation to America to resident James Brown Potter specifically but this claim cannot be verified through independent sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://blog.blacktieguide.com/2013/11/14/tuxedo-origins-formal-sundries/ |title=Tuxedo Origins: Formal Sundries |publisher=Black Tie Blog }}&lt;/ref&gt;  
Period newspaper accounts indicate that at first the jacket was worn by young mavericks to gatherings considered strictly formal. This led the American establishment to reject it out of hand. It was only by 1888 that polite society accepted its role solely as a summer and informal evening substitute at which point it became very popular.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://blog.blacktieguide.com/2013/11/12/tuxedo-origins-american-backlash/ |title=Tuxedo Origins: American Backlash |publisher=Black Tie Blog }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Evolution===
The earliest tuxedo jackets were of the same black material as the dress coat with one, two or no buttons and a shawl collar faced in satin or ribbed silk. By the turn of the twentieth century the peaked lapel was equally popular and the one-button model had become standard. When trousers were sold with the jacket they were of the same material. Edwardian [[dandy|dandies]] often opted for Oxford grey or a very dark blue for their evening wear.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.blacktieguide.com/History/06-Edwardian.htm |title=History: Edwardian Era |publisher=Black Tie Guide |date= |accessdate=2011-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By [[World War I]], the grey option had fallen out of favour but the &quot;[[midnight blue]]&quot; alternative became increasingly popular and rivalled black by the mid 1930s. Notch lapels, imported from the ordinary business suit, were a brief vogue in the 1920s.&lt;ref name=&quot;auto1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url= http://blog.blacktieguide.com/2014/03/06/spotlight-the-notched-lapel/ |title=Spotlight: The Notched Lapel |publisher=Black Tie Blog }}&lt;/ref&gt;  A single stripe of braid covering the outseam on each leg was an occasional variation at first, but became standard by the 1930s. At this time double-breasted jackets and white jackets became popular for wear in hot weather.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.blacktieguide.com/History/08-Depression_Era.htm |title=History: Depression Era |publisher=Black Tie Guide |date= |accessdate=2011-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Colour, texture and pattern became increasingly popular in warm-weather jackets in the 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.blacktieguide.com/History/09-Post_War.htm |title=History: Postwar Period |publisher=Black Tie Guide |date= |accessdate=2011-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the 1960s, these variations became increasingly common regardless of season or climate. Notch lapels were once again a fad.&lt;ref name=&quot;auto1&quot;/&gt; By the 1970s, mass-market retailers began offering white and coloured versions of the entire suit to its rental customers.&lt;ref name=&quot;auto2&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.blacktieguide.com/History/10-Jet_Age.htm |title=History: Jet Age |publisher=Black Tie Guide |date= |accessdate=2011-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.blacktieguide.com/History/11-Counterculture.htm |title=History: Counter-culture Era |publisher=Black Tie Guide |date= |accessdate=2011-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1980s vogue for nostalgic and retro styles returned evening wear to its black tone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.blacktieguide.com/History/13-Yuppie_Pt2.htm |title=History: Yuppie Years |publisher=Black Tie Guide |date= |accessdate=2011-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Notch lapels returned for good in the 1980s, and in the 1990s tuxedo jackets increasingly took on other traits of the business suit, such as two- and three-button styling, flap pockets, and centre vents. These trends have continued into the early 21st century and midnight blue is now once again a popular alternative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.blacktieguide.com/History/14-Millennium.htm |title=History: Millennial Era |publisher=Black Tie Guide |date= |accessdate=2011-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Accessories==
The tuxedo’s accompaniments have also evolved over time. The most traditional interpretation of these elements – formal shirt, formal waistcoat or cummerbund, black bow tie, formal shoes – is incorporated in the [[black tie]] dress code.

==Etiquette==
The tuxedo is a form of evening wear and as such is intended to be worn only in the evening.

==Contemporary use==

===United States===
The most popular uses of the tuxedo in North America at present are for formal weddings, galas, balls, formal proms and formal nights on cruises.  They are also often worn by male musicians at formal concerts. In these circumstances the tuxedo's styling and accessories are most commonly chosen according to the wearer's tastes. Less popular are [[black tie]] events, such as gala fundraisers, where men typically wear more traditional tuxedos and accessories as dictated by the dress code.

[[File:Summer dress (5634765615).jpg|thumb|Model wearing a sundress at a fashion show.]]

A '''sundress''' is a [[dress]] intended to be worn in warm weather. Typically, it is an informal or casual dress in a lightweight [[fabric]], most commonly [[cotton]], and usually loose fitting.  The dress is intended to be worn without a layering top. [[Lilly Pulitzer]] popularized the sundress in the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Chattanooga: Light clothes still heavy on style |author=  Karen Nazor Hill|url= http://timesfreepress.com/news/2008/jun/20/chattanooga-light-clothes-still-heavy-style/|newspaper= Chattanooga Times Free Press |date= 20 June 2008|accessdate=25 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current styles==
The sundress provides a feminine look that may be lighter and more comfortable than a skirt and blouse or another sort of dress. Sundresses can be of any [[neckline]] and [[hemline]], including modest styles and a variety of patterns. Sundresses are made in a variety of closure types, including back [[zipper]]s, side zippers, front [[button]]s, back buttons, back ties and pullover style.

A '''cheerleading uniform''' is a standardized outfit worn by cheerleaders during games and other events. These uniforms typically include the official colors and mascots of the school or team and are designed to make the wearer appear physically attractive.

== Early styles/brief history ==
[[File:Lafayette Cheerleaders 1922.jpg|thumb|right|Cheerleaders from 1922]]
This is the uniform outfit worn by [[cheerleading]] squads usually indicative of the [[mascot]], [[school]], and/or colors of the team and/or organization they are representing.  Cheerleading uniforms in the early 1900s were a steadfast symbol of the schools they represented, usually depicting the first letter of a high school or the first letter plus the letters &quot;H&quot; and &quot;S&quot;, standing for &quot;high school.&quot; These letters were normally sewn onto a [[sweater]]-type garment, sometimes even [[polo shirt]]s in warm weather. While showing school spirit and having a uniformed cheerleading team, these sweater-tops were often hot, bulky, and not very functional for any type of athletic movement. The most common type of sweater worn by cheerleaders in the early 1900s was a long [[cardigan (sweater)|cardigan]] with multiple buttons, normally worn over a [[Polo neck|turtle neck]] shirt or collared [[blouse]]. The school letters were often sewn in either corner of the sweater, sometimes in the middle of a [[megaphone]] shape.  Worn with the sweater was a very modest ankle-length [[wool]] skirt, often a darker color than the sweater.  Some early cheerleading squads chose [[Plaid (pattern)|plaid]] fabrics for skirts, often these squads were from religious schools and universities, as plaid was the main fabric of their classroom uniforms.
[[File:Sugar Bowl 1956 Pitt Panther.jpg|thumb|right|A cheerleader in 1956]]
Early cheerleading squads wore [[saddle shoes]] or flat canvas sneakers with high dress socks with their uniforms. This style of uniform continued through the 1950s and 1960s and is often depicted in movies and photos from that time period. One of the first companies to produce cheerleading uniforms was Cheerleader Supply Company, founded in 1948. The company was founded by [[Cheerleading|Lawrence &quot;Herkie&quot; Herkimer, of Dallas, TX and a former cheerleader at Southern Methodist University]], who began selling pom pom kits to local high schools. Herkie was also the first to organize cheerleading camps and competitions.

== Modern styles of cheerleading uniforms ==
As the focus of cheerleading shifted from an auxiliary unit, to an athletic pursuits, changes in the uniforms' material, style and fit were necessary.

=== 1960s uniforms ===
As fashion styles changed through the 1960s so did the cheerleading uniform. Gone were the overly long wool skirts, as pleated shorter skirts became more popular. The long skirt was essentially chopped in half as knee length [[cotton]] fabric skirts made for easier movement and a more comfortable experience for the wearer as compared to their wool counterparts. The sweater top changed dramatically, squads elected to wear short sleeve crew neck sweaters in favor of long cardigans, however the school letters and megaphone emblem remained, now being placed in the center of the stylish crew neck sweaters. Some squads in this time period, in particular high school squads, favored placing an additional embroidered emblem with the squad member's name on the center of the school letter patch. This was a symbol of high school popularity, as it was a huge privilege to be a cheerleader

=== 1970s uniforms ===
[[File:Porrista en foto viejo de futbol americano.JPG|thumb|right|A cheerleader in 1975]]
Much changed in uniform fashion from the 1960s. Most squads now wore more athletic [material] or [[tennis shoes]].Cheerleaders wore sneakers as opposed to saddle shoes or Keds, and the uniform was made less bulky to allow for easier movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Cosmato |first=Donna |url=http://cheerleading.lovetoknow.com/Cheerleading_Uniforms |title=Cheerleading Uniforms |publisher=Cheerleading.lovetoknow.com |date= |accessdate=2014-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also more variety was available for sweaters, vests or shells and skirts. The sweater now featured a stripe pattern on the front, in alternating school colors. The letter patch became more elaborate as well, often more colorful and unique. Sweaters were also less bulky and had a more flattering fit. This new slimmed style allowed better movement and more of a functional fit, without sacrificing modesty or tradition.  Sweaters were made to fit close to the body for a tighter fit, and the length was tapered very short to  eliminate excess fabric overlapping the skirt.  Often this caused the cheerleader's bare abdomen to be exposed during movement- by now most sweaters were worn without any shirt or collared blouse beneath them.  Different styles were incorporated to give squads more of a choice.  Round neck, and v-neck sweaters were popular with squads seeking greater functionality, as cheerleading was becoming more athletic instead of the standard vocal chant.  The new sweater styles allowed squads to eliminate the extra collared blouse beneath the sweater, essentially just wearing the sweater over a [[bra]].  While these uniforms provided a functional style, some modest women in society viewed these outfits as scandalous and racy.  The shorter skirts combined with the shorter and tighter sweaters were viewed by some as &quot;improper.&quot;

===1985–1995 uniforms===
Theses uniforms are similar to the current uniforms except [[slouch socks]] especially Wigwam [[slouch socks]] were very popular to wear. Also [[Keds]] champion sneakers were worn by many cheerleaders.  A typical school cheerleading uniform from 1985 does not look much different than a uniform today.  The favored top in this period was a waist-length button-down sleeveless vest, worn with or without a turtleneck layer underneath. The vest top was a modest style, and was mostly un-revealing. Also seen as a uniform top was a turtleneck worn underneath a sweatshirt. The choice skirt remained a pleat model, but with added color striping around the bottom hem. The length style preferred was shortened to mid-thigh or slightly longer for most squads. The general rule at this time was the skirt had to be down the end of fingers when arm down at side. Bike shorts were worn underneath with some uniforms.

=== Current uniforms ===
Most uniforms are currently made from a [[polyester]] blended fabric, usually containing [[spandex]] as well.  The top without the sleeves are called shells, if they have sleeves it is called a liner. Most American school squads wear a sleeveless top with either a [[sports bra]] or an athletic tank top underneath. If the shell lacks sleeves, many teams wear a turtle neck bodysuit under it, although this is not required specifically. The bodysuits can be either leotard like or covering only to the bottom of the ribcage.  Due to guidelines imposed by the [[National Federation of State High School Associations|National Federation of High Schools]], high school squads must have a top that covers their [[midriff]] with arms by their sides, however if the arms are raised most uniforms will show a small section of midriff, which is not against NFSHSA rules.  Most school-sanctioned squads have modest-looking uniform tops that are usually a waist-length fit, covering the whole frontal upper body except at the shoulders and arms when worn sleeveless. Likewise, the back construction of most school cheerleading tops cover the full upper body, however skin in the lower back area is mostly left uncovered if the cheerleader is sitting or bending; this does not violate NFSHSA uniform rules.  These requirements do not apply to all-star cheerleading organizations, therefore many have tops that stop at or just below the bottom of the [[bra]] line.  Another growing trend among all-star teams is having sections of material missing (allowing bare skin to show) across the top for the chest, the shoulders, the top of the back, or portions of the arms.  The length of skirts has shortened dramatically, with the average length for skirts at both high school and all-star being 10 to 13 &amp;nbsp;inches, and lengths are shrinking every year, however some coaches and various team sponsors encourage wearing shorter skirts due to safety reasons (too much fabric can be dangerous while tumbling).  Skirts are worn over top of colored or [[Metallic color|metallic]] spandex/polyester briefs, also called [[wiktionary:lollies|lollies]], [[wiktionary:spankies|spankies]], or bundies.  These briefs are worn over top of [[Undergarment|underpants]] and are sometimes printed with stars, dots, etc. The briefs can also sometimes have a team logo, such as a paw print, sewn on the side or across the behind.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

=== Piercing/tattoo rules ===

Due to the frequency of midriff exposure with most cheerleading tops, many school and all star coaches prohibit navel rings (belly rings) and other piercings while a cheerleader is  at a competition.  During competition most federations also enforce such bans.  While there is no official ban on tattoos, school sanctioned squads typically require that tattoos that could be visible in uniform, be covered with a bandage or waterproof skin shade makeup. Due to the popularity of lower back tattoos this method is becoming increasingly commonplace.

== Cheerleading uniform terminology ==
; Ribbons/bows

: Worn in the cheerleader's hair, which is often styled to match each other. The ribbons are usually the school's or the team's colors, and can be custom made or ordered through various companies.

; Bodysuit/bodyliner

: A leotard-like undergarment that matches the uniform colors and design, and is intended to be worn underneath the uniform shell.  Normally these are long-sleeved tops that snap at the bottom but they can be customized to the length of the shell top, either in a waist-length design or a crop-top style.  Most squads prefer to wear bodysuits during competition as it creates a uniformed look in arm movements. Waist length shells can be worn with several styles of bodyliners, in contrast to midriff shells which are limited to cropped stomach-showing liners. Full coverage bodyliners worn under a waist length shell eliminate all midriff exposure during cheering.  A cropped liner worn under a waist-length shell will cover the arms but leaves the stomach uncovered, allowing midriff skin to still show just as if the shell were to be worn alone.

; Shell/vest

: Made out of polyester and cotton, this is the main focal point of the uniform.  This is the top of the outfit which includes the design of the uniform stripes, school/team colors, and the mascot or high school insignias or school letters. Example: &quot;Willow High School&quot; would be &quot;WHS&quot;.  The shell is normally sleeveless with a &quot;V&quot; neckline, however the neckline style can often be customized by the school or team during the uniform ordering process. The shell can either have a zipper closure in the back or side to aid in dressing, or it can have a stretchy material that allows the top to expand slightly when dressing.  The shell is designed to fit somewhat snug but not tight on the wearer—it should fit close to the body.  The shell can be worn alone over a bra or [[camisole]], or it can be worn over-top a bodysuit of choice or a simple turtleneck. This is usually up to each squad's preference. A shell top is available in many lengths and even in somewhat intricate style cues.

; Full shell

: Usually sleeveless, and having a simple style design. It is normally waist length, ending at the top of the skirt. Typically worn alone with a bra underneath. This style top is worn by most American school squads as it is very modest and meets most dress codes, with midriff exposure limited to bare lower backs and an inch of frontal skin while the arms are raised.  The sleeveless shell, if worn alone, will normally leave the arms and shoulders open. A properly fitted shell top is essential in making the uniform look flattering for everyone on the cheer squad. A shell that is properly sized and fitted will leave enough room around the arm openings for movement, eliminating fabric rubbing against the underarms. Additionally, if the shell is sized with the correct measurements, the bottom of the hem should be long enough to meet the top of the skirt while standing stationary.  These tops can be highly customized from very ordinary to highly detailed designs. Certain cut-outs in sections of the garment are an option, as are varying hemlines for the bottom of the top. For instance, instead of a straight hem along the bottom of the top, some squads will choose a &quot;cut-up V&quot; hem, which leaves an upside down &quot;V&quot; notch open along the front, leaving slight midriff exposed at the belly button area.  This style is selected to allow for an additional color stripe along the bottom hem of the shell.

; Halter shell

: Similar in style and length as a full fitting shell top, but differing in the upper part of the garment.  This top is normally fully sleeveless, and more revealing of the upper back.  The halter style normally includes a neck strap on the top that ties in the back.

; [[Crop top]]/midriff

: This style of top is mostly used by colleges and out-of-school squads (all-star squads).  It is very revealing, and rarely worn by high school squads due to dress code violations. The top is typically worn sleeveless with only a bra underneath.  The school's or team's logo is featured in the center of the top.  The top ends right after the bra-line leaving the entire midriff of the cheerleader showing.  The National Federation of State High School Associations (NFHS) instituted a rule against cropped uniform tops at the high school level. Most cheerleading governing bodies outlaw this top from being worn by public schools in competition, however a few middle and high schools still choose to wear this style of top at their respective non-competing events, such as football games or parades.  There has been much debate on whether it is right to have a teenage girl wearing a garment like this at a public school, as much of the body is revealed by this top.

; Skirt

: The bottom of a cheerleading uniform, with matching colors and logo/stripe design as the shell.  Skirts can be very customizable with various styles of pleat designs, or no pleats at all, such as an &quot;A-line&quot; skirt. The general rule of length for skirts is mid-thigh and can be sized simply by using the &quot;fingertip&quot; rule.  Modern skirts are offered in various rises as well.  Traditionally the skirt should be worn at the natural waistline, at the navel area.  The traditional skirt should be high enough to touch the bottom of the shell slightly.  However some squads elect to wear low-rise skirts either with longer shells or with a normal length shell creating a midriff look. Bundies must be worn under the skirt.

{{Close Relationships}}

'''Dating''' is a part of the [[Mating (human)|human mating]] process whereby two people meet socially for [[companionship]], beyond the level of [[friendship]], or with the aim of each assessing the other's suitability as a partner in an [[intimate relationship]] or [[marriage]]. It can be a form of [[courtship]] consisting of [[socializing|social activities]] done by the couple. While the term has several meanings, it usually refers to the act of meeting and engaging in some mutually agreed upon social activity in public, together, as a couple.

The protocols and practices of dating, and the terms used to describe it, vary considerably from country to country and over time. The most common idea is two people trying out a relationship and exploring whether they are compatible by ''going out together'' in public as a couple who may or may not yet be having [[Human sexual activity|sexual relations]]. This period of courtship is sometimes seen as a precursor to [[engagement]] or [[marriage]].&lt;ref name=twsDecI28&gt;{{cite news|title= 'Lao wai' speak out on false image in China |publisher= ''China Daily'' |date= 2004-02-06 |url= http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/english/doc/2004-02/06/content_303955.htm |accessdate= 2010-12-09

==History==
[[File:Reza Abbasi - Two Lovers (1630).jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Persian miniature]] of [[Reza Abbasi]], featuring two lovers (1629-1630)]]
Dating as an institution is a relatively recent phenomenon which has mainly emerged in the last few centuries. From the standpoint of [[anthropology]] and [[sociology]], dating is linked with other institutions such as marriage and the [[family]] which have also been changing rapidly and which have been subject to many forces, including advances in technology and medicine. As humans have evolved from [[hunter-gatherer]]s into [[civilization|civilized societies]] and more recently into modern societies, there have been substantial changes in the relationship between men and women, with perhaps one of a few remaining [[biology|biological]] constants being that both adult [[Woman|women]] and [[Man|men]] must have [[sexual intercourse]] for human procreation to happen.&lt;ref&gt;Note: although even this is changing, with the advent of test-tube babies, in vitro fertilization, and such.&lt;/ref&gt;

Humans have been compared to other species in terms of sexual behavior. [[Neurobiology|Neurobiologist]] [[Robert Sapolsky]] constructed a reproductive spectrum with opposite poles being [[Display (zoology)|tournament species]], in which males compete fiercely for reproductive privileges with females, and [[pair bond]] arrangements, in which a male and female will bond for life.&lt;ref name=twsDecM11fss&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Sapolsky, humans are somewhat in the middle of this spectrum, in the sense that humans form pair bonds, but there is the possibility of cheating or changing partners.&lt;ref name=twsDecM11fss/&gt; These species-particular behavior patterns provide a context for aspects of [[human reproduction]], including dating. However, one particularity of the human species is that pair bonds are often formed without necessarily having the intention of reproduction. In modern times, emphasis on the institution of marriage, generally described as a male-female bond, has obscured pair bonds formed by same-sex and transsexual couples, and that many heterosexual couples also bond for life without offspring, or that often pairs that do have offspring separate. Thus, the concept of marriage is changing widely in many countries.

Historically, marriages in most societies were [[Arranged marriage|arranged by parents]] and older relatives with the goal not being [[love]] but legacy and &quot;economic stability and political alliances&quot;, according to [[anthropology|anthropologists]].&lt;ref name=twsDecM11&gt;{{cite news

 |accessdate= 2010-12-13
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Accordingly, there was little need for a temporary trial period such as dating before a permanent community-recognized union was formed between a man and a woman. While pair-bonds of varying forms were recognized by most societies as acceptable social arrangements, marriage was reserved for heterosexual pairings and had a transactional nature, where wives were in many cases a form of property being exchanged between father and husband, and who would have to serve the function of reproduction. Communities exerted pressure on people to form pair-bonds in places such as [[Europe]]; in [[China]], society &quot;demanded people get married before having a sexual relationship&quot;&lt;ref name=twsDecI22bb&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; and many societies found that some formally recognized bond between a man and a woman was the best way of rearing and educating [[child]]ren as well as helping to avoid conflicts and misunderstandings regarding competition for mates.

Generally, during much of recorded history of humans in civilization, and into the [[Middle Ages]] in [[Europe]], weddings were seen as [[business]] arrangements between families, while romance was something that happened outside of marriage discreetly, such as covert meetings.&lt;ref name=twsDecH34a/&gt; The 12th-century book ''The Art of Courtly Love'' advised that &quot;True love can have no place between husband and wife.&quot;&lt;ref name=twsDecH34a&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to one view, clandestine meetings between men and women, generally outside of marriage or before marriage, were the precursors to today's dating.&lt;ref name=twsDecH34a/&gt;

From about 1700 a worldwide movement perhaps described as the &quot;empowerment of the individual&quot; took hold, leading towards greater emancipation of women and equality of individuals. Men and women became more equal politically, financially, and socially in many nations. Women eventually won the right to vote in many countries and own property and receive [[Equality before the law|equal treatment by the law]], and these changes had profound impacts on the relationships between men and women. Parental influence declined. In many societies, individuals could decide—on their own—whether they should marry, whom they should marry, and when they should marry. A few centuries ago, dating was sometimes described as a &quot;courtship ritual where young women entertained gentleman callers, usually in the home, under the watchful eye of a [[Chaperone (social)|chaperone]],&quot;&lt;ref name=twsDecH25bb&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; but increasingly, in many Western countries, it became a self-initiated activity with two young people going out as a couple in public together. Still, dating varies considerably by nation, custom, religious upbringing, technology, and social class, and important exceptions with regards to individual freedoms remain as many countries today still practice arranged marriages, request dowries, and forbid same-sex pairings. Although in many countries, movies, meals, and meeting in coffeehouses and other places is now popular, as are advice books suggesting various strategies for men and women,&lt;ref name=twsDecH26c&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; in other parts of the world, such as in South Asia and many parts of the Middle East, being alone in public as a couple with another person is not only frowned upon but can even lead to either person being socially ostracized.

In the twentieth century, dating was sometimes seen as a precursor to marriage but it could also be considered as an end-in-itself, that is, an informal social activity akin to [[friendship]]. It generally happened in that portion of a person's life before the age of marriage,&lt;ref name=twsDecH34b&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; enabled dates to be arranged without face-to-face contact. [[effects of the automobile on societies|Cars]] extended the range of dating as well as enabled back-seat sexual exploration. In the mid-twentieth century, the advent of [[birth control]] as well as safer procedures for [[abortion]] changed the equation considerably, and there was less pressure to marry as a means for satisfying sexual urges. New types of relationships formed; it was possible for people to live together without marrying and without [[children]]. Information about [[human sexuality]] grew, and with it an acceptance of all types of sexual orientations is becoming more common. Today, the institution of dating continues to evolve at a rapid rate with new possibilities and choices opening up.

==Dating as a social relationship==

===Wide variation in behavior patterns===
[[File:Mary Poppins8.jpg|thumb|right|[[Julie Andrews]] as [[Mary Poppins]].]]
{{quote|text=And the only rule is that there are no rules.|sign=[[Kira Cochrane]]&lt;ref name=twsDecH27a134kcc/&gt;}}
Social rules regarding dating vary considerably according to variables such as country, social class, religion, age, sexual orientation and gender. Behavior patterns are generally unwritten and constantly changing. There are considerable differences between social and personal [[Value (personal and cultural)|values]]. Each culture has particular patterns which determine such choices as whether the man asks the woman out, where people might meet, whether kissing is acceptable on a first date, the substance of conversation, who should pay for meals or entertainment,&lt;ref name=&quot;twsDecH26j&quot;&gt;{{cite news

Among the [[Karen people]] in [[Burma]] and [[Thailand]], women are expected to write love poetry and give gifts to win over the man.&lt;ref name=&quot;Phan, Zoya 2009&quot;&gt;Phan, Zoya (2009). Little Daughter: a Memoir of Survival in Burma and the West. [[Simon &amp; Schuster]].&lt;/ref&gt; Since dating can be a stressful situation, there is the possibility of humor to try to reduce tensions. For example, director [[Blake Edwards]] wanted to date singing star [[Julie Andrews]], and he joked in parties about her persona by saying that her &quot;endlessly cheerful governess&quot; image from movies such as ''[[Mary Poppins (film)|Mary Poppins]]'' and ''[[The Sound of Music (film)|The Sound of Music]]'' gave her the image of possibly having &quot;lilacs for pubic hair&quot;;&lt;ref name=twsDecQ&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Andrews appreciated his humor, sent him lilacs, dated him and later married him, and the couple stayed together for 41 years until his death in 2010.&lt;ref name=twsDecQ/&gt;

===Different meanings of the term===
While the term ''dating'' has many meanings, the most common refers to a trial period in which two people explore whether to take the relationship further towards a more permanent relationship; in this sense, dating refers to the time when people are physically together in public as opposed to the earlier time period in which people are arranging the date, perhaps by corresponding by email or text or phone.&lt;ref name=twsDecH27der5/&gt; Another meaning of the term ''dating'' is to describe a stage in a person's life when he or she is actively pursuing romantic relationships with different people. If two unmarried celebrities are seen in public together, they are often described as &quot;dating&quot; which means they were seen in public together, and it is not clear whether they are merely friends, exploring a more intimate relationship, or are romantically involved. A related sense of the term is when two people have been out in public only a few times but have not yet committed to a relationship; in this sense, ''dating'' describes an initial trial period and can be contrasted with &quot;being in a committed relationship&quot;.

===Evaluation===
One of the main purposes of dating is for two or more people to evaluate one another’s suitability as a long term companion or spouse.  Often physical characteristics, personality, financial status, and other aspects of the involved persons are judged and as a result feelings can be hurt, and confidence shaken.  Because of the uncertainty of the whole situation, the desire to be acceptable to the other person, and the possibility of rejection, dating can be very stressful for all parties involved.

While some of what happens on a date is guided by an understanding of basic, unspoken rules, there is considerable room to experiment, and there are numerous sources of advice available.

===Gender differences===
There is general perception that men and women approach dating differently, hence the reason why advice for each sex varies greatly, particularly when dispensed by popular magazines. For example, it is a common belief that heterosexual men often seek women based on [[Physical attractiveness|beauty]] and [[youth]].&lt;ref name=twsDecH22/&gt;&lt;ref name=twsDecM18&gt;{{cite news

All of these are examples of gender stereotypes which plague dating discourse and shape individuals' and societies' expectations of how heterosexual relationships should be navigated. In addition to the deterimental effects of upholding limited views of relationships and sexual and romantic desires, stereotypes also lead to framing social problems in a problematic way. For example, some have noted that educated women in many countries including [[Italy]] and [[Russia]] and the [[United States]] find it difficult to have a [[career]] as well as raise a family, prompting a number of writers to suggest how women should approach dating and how to time their careers and personal life. Yet the advice comes with the assumption that the work-life balance is inherently a &quot;woman's problem&quot;. In many societies there is a view that women should fulfill the role of primary caregivers, with little to no spousal support and with few services by employers or government such as parental leave or child care. Accordingly, an issue regarding dating is the subject of career timing which generates controversy. Some views reflect a traditional notion of gender roles. For example, [[Danielle Crittenden]] in ''What Our Mothers Didn't Tell Us'' argued that having both a career and family at the same time was taxing and stressful for a woman; as a result, she suggested that women should date in their early twenties with a seriousness of purpose, marry when their relative beauty permitted them to find a reliable partner, have children, then return to work in their early thirties with kids in school; Crittenden acknowledged that splitting a career path with a ten-year baby-raising hiatus posed difficulties.&lt;ref name=twsDecxfpu89&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are contrasting views which suggest that women should focus on careers in their twenties and thirties. Columnist [[Maureen Dowd]] quoted comedian [[Bill Maher]] on the subject of differing dating agendas between men and women: &quot;Women get in relationships because they want somebody to talk to -- men want women to shut up.&quot;&lt;ref name=twsDecH26b&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is increasingly common today, however, with new generations and in a growing number of countries, to frame the work-life balance issue as a social problem rather than a gender problem. With the advent of a changing workplace, the increased participation of women in the [[labor force]], an increasing number of men who are picking up their share of parenting and housework,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.contemporaryfamilies.org/marriage-partnership-divorce/menchange.html] Article&lt;/ref&gt; and more and more governments and industries committing themselves to achieving gender equality, the question of whether or not, or when to start a family is slowly being recognized as an issue that touches (or should touch) both genders.

There are increasing incidences when couples initiate contact on their own, particularly if they live in a foreign country; in one case, a couple met surreptitiously over a game of cards.&lt;ref name=twsDecH36/&gt; Indians who move abroad to Britain or America often follow the cultural patterns of their new country: for example, one Indian woman met a white American man while skiing, and married him, and the formerly &quot;all-important relatives&quot; were reduced to bystanders trying to influence things ineffectively.&lt;ref name=twsDecH36/&gt; Factors operating worldwide, such as increased affluence, the need for longer education, and greater mobility have lessened the appeal for arranged marriages, and these trends have affected criteria about which possible partners are acceptable, making it more likely that pairings will cross previously impenetrable barriers such as caste or ethnic background.&lt;ref name=twsDecH36/&gt; Indian-Americans in the U.S. sometimes participate in ''Singles Meets'' organized by websites which happen about once a month, with 100 participants at each event; an organizer did not have firm statistics about the success rate leading to a long-term relationship but estimated about one in every ten members finds a partner through the site.&lt;ref name=twsDecH36gg&gt;{{cite news

Dating websites are gaining ground in India. Writer Rupa Dev preferred websites which emphasized authenticity and screened people before entering their names into their databases, making it a safer environment overall, so that site users can have greater trust that it is safe to date others on the site.&lt;ref name=twsDecH41bb&gt;{{cite news

During the interval before marriage, whether it is an arranged or a love marriage, [[private detective]]s have been hired to check up on a prospective bride or groom, or to verify claims about a potential spouse made in newspaper advertising, and there are reports that such [[espionnage|snooping]] is increasing.&lt;ref name=twsDecIv16b/&gt; Detectives investigate former amorous relationships and can include fellow college students, former police officers skilled in investigations, and medical workers &quot;with access to health records.&quot;&lt;ref name=twsDecIv16b/&gt;

Transsexuals and eunuchs have begun using Internet dating in some states in India.&lt;ref name=twsDecIv13/&gt;

The practice of dating runs against some religious traditions, and the radical Hindu group [[Sri Ram Sena]] threatened to &quot;force unwed couples&quot; to marry, if they were discovered dating on [[Valentine's Day]]; a fundamentalist leader said &quot;drinking and dancing in bars and celebrating this day has nothing to do with Hindu traditions.&quot;&lt;ref name=twsDecIv22/&gt; The threat sparked a protest via the Internet which resulted in cartloads of pink panties being sent to the fundamentalist leader's office.&lt;ref name=twsDecIv22&gt;{{cite news |author= Nandita VIJ |title= Women plan pink panty response to 'Hindu Taliban' |publisher= ''France 24'' |date= 2009-07-23 |url= http://www.france24.com/en/20090211-india-valentines-day-chaddi-campaign-sri-ram-sena-hindu-fundamentalists |accessdate= 2010-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; as part of the [[Pink Chaddi Campaign]] (Pink Underwear/Panties Campaign).

==== Korea ====
The reasons for dating in Korea are various. Research conducted by ''Saegye Daily'' showed that teenagers choose to date for reasons such as &quot;to become more mature,&quot; &quot;to gain consultation on worries, or troubles,&quot; or &quot;to learn the difference between boys and girls,&quot; etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.naver.com/main/read.nhn?mode=LSD&amp;mid=sec&amp;sid1=102&amp;oid=022&amp;aid=0000146456|title=중학입학전 이성교제 76%|work=naver.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, a news report in ''MK Daily'' showed that the primary reasons for dating for workers of age 20 ~ 30 are &quot;emotional stability,&quot; &quot;marriage,&quot; &quot;someone to spend time with,&quot; etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.mk.co.kr/newsRead.php?year=2013&amp;no=442164|title=MK News - `직장인 연애 목적 1위는 결혼이 아니다`|work=mk.co.kr}}&lt;/ref&gt; An interesting feature in the reasons for dating in Korea is that many Koreans are somewhat motivated to find a date due to the societal pressure that often views single persons as incompetent.&lt;ref name=&quot;news.kukinews.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.kukinews.com/article/view.asp?page=1&amp;gCode=kmi&amp;arcid=0006704337&amp;cp=nv|title=[살며 사랑하며-안주연] 연애 난민|work=kukinews.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Present Korean dating shows a changing attitude due to the influence of tradition and modernization. There are a lot of Confucian ideas and practices that still saturate South Korean culture and daily life as traditional values.&lt;ref&gt;[[Korean Confucianism#Contemporary society and Confucianism]]&lt;/ref&gt; Patriarchy in Korea has been grounded on Confucian culture that postulated hierarchical social orders according to age and sex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kim|first1=Kwang-ok|title=The Reproduction of Confucian Culture in Contemporary Korea: An Anthropological Study,&quot; In Confucian Traditions in East Asian Modernity|date=1996|publisher=Harvard University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; Patriarchy and Women Patriarchy is &quot;a system of social structure and practices in which men dominate, oppress and exploit women” which is well reflected in the ways of dating in Korea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Review of Korean Studies|journal=Academy of Korean Studies|date=2002|volume=5|issue=2|page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adding to it, there is an old saying that says a boy and a girl should not sit together after they have reached the age of seven. It is one of the old teachings of Confucianism&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://terms.naver.com/entry.nhn?docId=2015363&amp;cid=4386&amp;categoryId=4386|title=남녀칠세부동석|work=naver.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and reveals its inclination toward conservatism.

Most Koreans tend to regard dating as a precursor to marriage. According to a survey conducted by Gyeonggi-do Family Women’s Researcher on people of age 26-44, 85.7% of respondents replied as ‘willing to get married’. There is no dating agency but the market for marriage agencies are growing continuously.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.mk.co.kr/newsRead.php?year=2013&amp;no=1203881|title=MK News - &quot;배우자나 찾아볼까&quot;…불황에도 `잘나가는` 결혼정보회사|work=mk.co.kr}}&lt;/ref&gt; DUO and Gayeon are one of the major marriage agencies in Korea. Also, “Mat-sun,” the blind date which is usually based on the premise of marriage, is held often among ages of late 20s to 30s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.acrofan.com/ko-kr/live/news/20130124/00000008}}&lt;/ref&gt; But the late trend is leaning towards the separation between dating and marriage unlike the conservative ways of the past.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ebuzz.co.kr/news/min/2646961_4993.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the survey conducted by a marriage agency, of 300 single males and females who were asked of their opinions on marrying their lovers, about only 42% of the males and 39% of the females said yes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.munhwa.com/news/view.html?no=20120914MW155627466399|title=미혼남녀 절반이상 ‘연애 상대와 결혼, 글쎄’|work=munhwa.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are also cases of dating without the premise of marriage. However, the majority still takes getting into a relationship seriously.

Dating in Korea is also considered a necessary activity supported by society.&lt;ref name=&quot;news.kukinews.com&quot;/&gt; Korean adults are constantly questioned whether or not they are dating by the people around them.&lt;ref name=&quot;news.kukinews.com&quot;/&gt; During family gatherings on holidays one of the questions that people hate getting asked the most is related to marriage.&lt;ref name=&quot;news1.kr&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news1.kr/articles/1005265|title=명절 스트레스 1위 질문 &quot;결혼은? 애인은? 애는?&quot;|work=뉴스1 코리아}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to a survey it was the highest ranked by 47.3 percent.&lt;ref name=&quot;news1.kr&quot;/&gt;

College students in their sophomore to junior year who have not been in a relationship feel anxious that they are falling behind amongst their peers. Most of them try “sogaeting”, going out on a blind date, for the first time to get into a relationship. Dating is a duty that most people feel they must take on to not seem incompetent.&lt;ref name=&quot;h21.hani.co.kr&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://h21.hani.co.kr/arti/special/special_general/36496.html|title=[제1000호]연애, 마침내 ‘스펙’이 되다 : 특집일반 : 특집 : 뉴스 : 한겨레21|work=hani.co.kr}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In recent trends, even dramas such as “”Shining Romance” (“빛나는 로맨스”), and “Jang Bo-ri is Here!” (“왔다 장보리”),  and in a variety show called, “Dad! Where Are We Going?” (“아빠 어디가?”) there are elementary children confessing their love.

Dating has also been depicted to be an activity of fun and happiness. There are Korean TV programs that film celebrities together as married couples supporting this depiction of dating such as “We Got Married” (“우리 결혼했어요”), “With You” (“님과 함께”) and “The Man Who Gets Married Daily” (“매일 결혼 하는 남자.”)&lt;ref name=&quot;h21.hani.co.kr&quot;/&gt;

According to a survey by wedding consulting agency, men consider a physical relation as a catalyst of love, otherwise, women regard it as a confirmation of affection. Adding to it, both 79.2% of men and 71.0% of women stated that how deep their physical relation in dating is concerned in the decision of whether to marry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.donga.com/3/all/20080710/8600934/1|title=연인들의 스킨쉽…男 ‘사랑의 촉진제’, 女 ‘애정확인’|work=donga.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Pakistan====
Marriages and courtship in [[Pakistan]] are influenced by traditional cultural practices similar to those elsewhere in the [[Indian subcontinent]] as well as [[Muslim]] norms and manners. Illegitimate relationships before marriage are considered a social taboo and social interaction between unmarried men and women is encouraged at a modest and healthy level. Couples are usually wedded through either an [[arranged marriage]] or [[love marriage]]. Love marriages are those in which the individuals have chosen a partner whom they like by their own choice prior to marriage, and usually occur with the consent of parents and family. Arranged marriages on the other hand are marriages which are set and agreed by the families or guardians of the two individuals where the couple may not have met before. In either cases and in consistency with traditional marital practices, individuals who marry are persuaded to meet and talk to each other for some time before considering marrying so that they can check their compatibility.

====Singapore====
[[Singapore]]'s largest dating service, SDU, [[Social Development Unit]], is a government-run dating system. The original SDU, which controversially promoted marriages among university graduate singles, no longer exists today. On 28 January 2009, it was merged with SDS [Social Development Services], which just as controversially promoted marriages among non-graduate singles. The merged unit, SDN [http://app.sdn.sg/AboutSDN.aspx Social Development Network] seeks to promote meaningful relationships, with marriage touted as a top life goal, among all resident [Singapore] singles within a conducive network environment of singles, relevant commercial and public entities.

[[File:Frédéric Soulacroix - Flirtation 2.jpg|thumb|right|Flirting, aristocratic-style&lt;br&gt;Painting by Frédéric Soulacroix (1858–1933)]]
In Britain, the term ''dating'' bears similarity to the American sense of the tentative exploratory part of a relationship. If two people are ''going out together'', it may mean they're dating but that their relationship has advanced to a relatively long-standing and sexual boyfriend-girlfriend relationship although they're not cohabitating. Although Britons are familiar with the term ''dating,'' the rituals surrounding courtship are somewhat different from those commonly found in [[North America]]. Writer [[Kira Cochrane]] advises daters to &quot;get out there and meet people&quot; while noting a trend of temporary suspension of marriage until an individual reaches his or her thirties.&lt;ref name=twsDecH27a134kcc&gt;{{cite news

====German-speaking countries====
[[File:Wilhelm Gause 004.jpg|thumb|Ball of City of [[Vienna]] (1900)]]
While analysts such as [[Harald Martenstein]] and others suggest that it is easier for persons to initiate contact in America, many Germans view the American dating habits as &quot;unspontaneous&quot;, &quot;ridiculous&quot; and &quot;rigid&quot;.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}} Until the 1960s, countries such as [[Germany]], [[Switzerland]] and [[Austria]] had a more formal approach for first contacts that was eased during seasonal festivals like [[Carnival in Germany, Switzerland and Austria|carnival]] and festivals and [[Travelling funfair|funfair]]s like the [[Oktoberfest]], which allowed for more casual flirts.&lt;ref&gt;Politik in einer deutschen Kleinstadt, [d. i. Bretten], Enke, Stuttgart 1970, ISBN 3-432-01618-2, Benita Luckmann&lt;/ref&gt;

Membership in [[voluntary association]]s is relatively high in German-speaking countries and these provided further chances for possible partners to meet. Strolling on [[Esplanade]]s and Promenade walkways such as the one in Hamburg called the [[Jungfernstieg]] (maidens way), have been another venue for introductions as early as the 19th century. Analyst [[Geoffrey Gorer]] described dating as an American [[idiosyncrasy]] focusing on youth of college age and expressed in activities such as American [[prom]]s. In contrast German speaking countries and the longstanding musical tradition there provided ample opportunity of persons of varying ages enjoying social dances, such as the [[Vienna Opera Ball]] and other occasions.

Romantic encounters were often described with [[French language|French]] terms like [[wikt:rendezvous|rendezvous]] or [[wikt:tête-à-tête|tête-à-tête]]. The [[German language|German]] term of ''Stelldichein'' (as translated by [[Joachim Heinrich Campe]]s) is used to signify dating when the age of consent to marriage was relatively high. German traditions to signify lovers who met in hiding were described with terms like ''Fensterln'' (windowing) or ''Kiltgang'' (dawn stroll) used in [[Bavaria]] and [[Switzerland]].&lt;ref Name=mart&gt;[http://www.zeit.de/2009/28/Martenstein-28 &quot;No talk, no deal&quot; Unser Kolumnist versteht endlich die amerikanischen Regeln der Partnerwahl] (Our Commentator finally understands the American Rucles of choosing a partner) [[Harald Martenstein]], [[Die Zeit]]  29.6.2009&lt;/ref&gt; Analyst Sebastian Heinzel sees a major cultural divide between American dating habits and European informality, and leads to instances in which European expatriates in cities such as [[New York, New York|New York]] keep to themselves.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tagesspiegel.de/zeitung/das-war-so-nicht-verabredet/v_default,1061296.html Das war so nicht verabredet! This we havent agreed upon!] Tagesspiegel 07.10.2007, Sebastian Heinzel&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, most German couples in long-term relationships get to know each other through mutual friends, at work or while going out at night; the first few months of dating often involve sexual intercourse, but are still rather casual and do not imply a serious wish to get married.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bild.de/ratgeber/partnerschaft/dating/hier-lernen-sich-die-meisten-paare-kennen-28022476.bild.html|title=Wo findet man einen Partner?

===Matchmaking systems and services===
Dating systems can be systematic and organized ways to improve [[matchmaking]] by using rules or technology. The meeting can be in-person or ''live'' as well as separated by time or space such as by [[telephone]] or [[email]] or chat-based. The purpose of the meeting is for the two persons to decide whether to go on a date in the future.

* [[Speed dating]] consists of organized matchmaking events that have multiple single persons meet one-on-one in brief timed sessions so that singles can assess further whether to have subsequent dates. An example is meeting perhaps twenty potential partners in a bar with brief interviews between each possible couple, perhaps lasting three minutes in length, and shuffling partners. In [[Shanghai, China|Shanghai]], one event featured eight-minute one-on-one meetings in which participants were pre-screened by age and education and career, and which costs 50 yuan ($6 USD) per participant; participants are asked not to reveal contact information during the brief meeting with the other person, but rather place names in cards for organizers to arrange subsequent dates.&lt;ref name=twsDecI24&gt;{{cite news

* '''Video dating''' systems of the 1980s and 1990s especially, where customers gave a performance on (typically [[VHS]]) video, which was viewable by other customers, usually in private, in the same facility. Some services would record and play back videos for men and women on alternate days to minimize the chance that customers would meet each other on the street.
* '''Phone dating''' systems of about the same vintage, where customers call a common voice mail or phone-chat server at a common local phone number, and are connected with other (reputed) singles, and typically charged by the minute as if it were a long-distance call (often a very expensive one). A key problem of such systems was that they were hard to differentiate from a phone porn service or &quot;[[phone sex]]&quot; where female operators are paid to arouse male customers and have no intention of ever dating them.

[[Online dating service]]s are becoming increasingly prevalent worldwide. They charge a fee to enable a user to post a profile of himself or herself, perhaps using video or still images as well as descriptive data and personal preferences for dating, such as age range, hobbies, and so forth. Online dating is a $2 billion per year business, as of 2014, with an annual growth rate of 5%. The industry is dominated by a few large companies, such as [[EHarmony]], [[Zoosk]] and [[InterActiveCorp]], or IAC, which owns several brands including [[Match.com]] and [[OKCupid]]. However new entrants continue to emerge.&lt;ref name=latimes2015 /&gt;

An earlier report suggested that online dating businesses were thriving financially, with growth in members, service offerings, membership fees and with many users renewing their accounts, although the overall share of Internet traffic using online dating services in the U.S. has declined somewhat, from 2003 (21% of all Internet users) to 2006 (10%), and that dating sites must work to convince users that they're safe places having quality members.&lt;ref name=twsDecI41&gt;{{cite news

===In board games===
''[[Mystery Date (game)|Mystery Date]]'' is a [[board game]] from the [[Milton Bradley Company]], originally released in 1965 and reissued in 1970, 1999, and in 2005, whose object is to be ready for a date by acquiring three matching color-coded cards to assemble an outfit. The outfit must then match the outfit of the date at the &quot;mystery door&quot;. If the player's outfit does not match the date behind the door, the door is closed and play continues. The game has been [[Mystery Date (game)|mentioned, featured, or parodied]] in several popular films and television shows.

===In television===
Numerous [[Reality TV|television reality]] and [[game show]]s, past and current, address dating. For example, the [[dating game show]]s ''[[The Dating Game]]'' first aired in 1965, while more modern shows in that genre include ''[[The Manhattan Dating Project]]'' (US Movie about Dating in New York City), ''[[Blind Date (US TV series)|Blind Date]]'', ''[[The 5th Wheel]]'', and ''[[The Bachelor (US TV series)|The Bachelor]]'' and its spinoff series, in which a high degree of support and aids are provided to individuals seeking dates. These are described more fully in an [[Dating game show|article on them alone]] and in the related article on &quot;[[reality game show]]s&quot; that often include or motivate romantic episodes between players.  Another category of dating-oriented reality TV shows involves [[matchmaking]], such as ''[[Millionaire Matchmaker]]'' and ''[[Tough Love (TV series)|Tough Love]]''.

Dating can happen for people in most age groups with the possible exception of children. [[Teenagers]] and [[Preadolescence|tweens]] have been described as dating; according to the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|CDC]], three-quarters of eighth and ninth graders in the United States described themselves as &quot;dating&quot;, although it is unclear what is exactly meant by this term.&lt;ref name=twsDecH12&gt;{{cite news

      <text xml:space="preserve">There are many and varied [[Norm (sociology)|customs]] associated with the celebration of [[birthday]]s around the world.

==Birthday cakes==
The [[birthday cake]] is traditionally highly decorated, and typically covered with lit [[candle]]s when presented, the number of candles signifying the age of the celebrant. The person whose birthday it is may make a silent [[Wish (fiction)|wish]] and then blow out the candles.  It is also common for the person celebrating their birthday to cut the initial piece of the cake as a newlywed couple might with a [[wedding cake]]. The birthday boy/girl traditionally gets to eat the first piece of the cake.

==Birthday parties==
In [[Western culture]]s, particularly in the United States and Australia, [[Party#Birthday party|birthday parties]] are often accompanied by colorful decorations, such as [[balloon]]s and streamers. A [[birthday cake]] is often served with candles that are to be blown out after a “birthday wish” has been made. While the birthday cake is being brought to the table, the lucky song ''[[Happy Birthday to You]]'' is sung out of tune by the guests. A practice most common among wealthy people and [[Celebrity|celebrities]], but engaged in by many others as well, is to hire an [[event management]] agency or a [[party service]] to organize a birthday party.

A child’s birthday party may be held at his/her home or in a public place. [[Soft drink]]s are often had alongside water and both sweet and savory foods are typically served to the guests. In many cultures, a [[birthday cake]] is served. Birthday parties for children often feature entertainment, costumes, [[party game]]s, and a theme. Adults’ birthday parties in Western countries are often held in [[Bar (establishment)|bars]] or [[nightclub]]s. Though some are held at a restaurant or even at home. A birthday party usually includes gifts for the person whose birthday it is. Most people who come to the birthday party are the ones who have the gifts.

==Birthday presents==
In addition to parties, it is common for people to receive [[gift]]s on their birthday. Popular gifts include toys, books, jewellery, clothes, flowers, technical devices, gift cards, checks, paper money, etc. Items such as underwear and socks are generally not as well appreciated by younger children, even if they are emblazoned with popular characters. Sometimes it is expected of the person celebrating their birthday to treat their party guests instead; this varies depending on the local culture and may involve party gifts or other gestures, for example inviting the guests to the restaurant or bar (some of them offer special birthday programs), arranging parties at home, or at work.{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}}
In South Africa, however, birthdays are highly celebrated. In a given town or township, everyone is invited, including the older family members; it does not matter how young or old the person is. These celebrations are noted by big white tents being erected in the yards, which symbolize a huge celebration of some sort. Birthday presents range from gifts such as toys to animal sacrifices.
==Birthday greetings==
In most English-speaking countries it is traditional to sing the song ''[[Happy Birthday to You]]'' to the honored person celebrating a birthday. Happy Birthday songs are common worldwide; similar songs exist in other languages. This song is a common greeting used on birthdays, along with [[greeting card]]s and verbal greetings with messages such as &quot;I wish you a Happy Birthday&quot; or &quot;Happy Birthday.&quot;

==Punches, bumps, and other birthday torments==
{{original research|section|date=June 2014}}
&quot;The bumps&quot;, or &quot;the dumps&quot; in Scotland,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Robinson|editor1-first=Mairi|title=The Concise Scots Dictionary|date=1985|publisher=Aberdeen University Press|isbn=0080284922|pages=164-5|quote='''gie someone his''' ''or'' '''get one's dumps''' give or get thumps on the back as a birthday ritual, the number corresponding to the age reached}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dsl.ac.uk/|quote=A children’s birthday ceremony, taking various forms, for example: the child is held by the hands and feet and its back thumped on the floor, a thump for each year of age, sometimes dropped on the final count (Ork., Ags., Fif., Edb., Dmb., Ayr., Dmf., Rxb. 2000s).}}&lt;/ref&gt; a birthday torment common in countries such as the UK, Ireland, Canada, and India,&lt;ref name=Chambers1&gt;{{cite book|title=Chambers Book of Facts|isbn=978-0-550-10287-4|pages=18&amp;ndash;19|chapter=The Bumps|url=http://chambersharrap.co.uk/chambers/books/reference/KCC_18_19_141_211.pdf|format=[[Portable Document Format|PDF]]|publisher=Chambers|year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; involves the friends and family of the person whose birthday it is taking him or her by the arms and legs, and &quot;bumping&quot; him/her up into the air and down onto the floor.&lt;ref name=Chambers1 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Chambers2&gt;{{cite encyclopaedia|encyclopedia=The Chambers 21st Century Dictionary|publisher=Allied Publishers|isbn=9788186062265|article=bump|pages=187}}&lt;/ref&gt; The number of &quot;bumps&quot; given equals the age of the person in years plus one &quot;for luck&quot;.&lt;ref name=Chambers1 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Chambers2 /&gt; Usually &quot;the Bumps&quot; are administered only to children, in part because as people grow up they become too heavy for the process.&lt;ref name=Chambers1 /&gt; Sometimes bumps are also referred to as kicks where the person celebrating their birthday is held by their arms and legs and their friends kick them. This practice is often disapproved in regard to health and safety concerns.

In French-speaking Canada, the U.S. and Australia, &quot;birthday punches&quot; are given in a similar fashion, where the person whose birthday it is being punched a number of times equal to his/her age, often with one additional punch &quot;for luck&quot;.&lt;ref name=Chambers1 /&gt;In some places, instead of a punch &quot;for luck,&quot; the recipient is pinched &quot;to grow an inch.&quot; In Brazil, Hungary, Argentina, Italy, and other countries, the person has his/her earlobes pulled.&lt;ref name=Chambers1 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Primary society and environment, Book 3|publisher=R.I.C. Publications|year=2004|isbn=9781741261240|pages=18|chapter=Celebrations}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Hungarian tradition also involves at the same time as pulling the earlobes wishing the person a happy birthday or reciting a rhyme whose English translation is &quot;God bless you, live so long so your ears reach your ankles.&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kidsparties.com/TraditionsInDifferentCountries.htm|title=Birthday Traditions in Different Countries|year=2009|publisher=Daric Systems, Inc.|work=Traditions|author=Kids Parties Connection}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similar to birthday punches are birthday spankings. While they are usually administered to children, the practice is somewhat common, even in areas and communities or among families where corporal punishment is otherwise frowned upon. The spankings, characteristically, are mostly administered in such a fashion that they do not hurt the recipient at all, or if they do, it is usually only a small &quot;sting&quot;. With this tradition the birthday recipient, as a general rule, gets spanked on his or her buttocks the same number of times as the number of years they have been alive, often with a final, extra spank administered as &quot;one to grow on&quot;.

In Israel, part of the birthday celebration for a child in kindergarten is to lift the decorated chair that the child sits on into the air several times, once for each year of the child's age, plus &quot;one for the next year&quot;.&lt;ref name=Chambers1 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Culture and human development: an introduction|series=Developmental Series|author=Jaan Valsiner|publisher=SAGE|year=2000|isbn=9780761956846|pages=252}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Venezuela, a widespread custom is to attempt the pushing of the person's face into the birthday cake when they blow out the candles. This frequently destroys the cake.

Birthday punches are administered throughout the day, but if the &quot;birthday boy&quot; hides from the punches, one final punch is allowed to be given.

A '''camp shirt''' or '''lounge shirt''' is a loose, straight-cut, short-sleeved [[shirt]] or [[blouse]] with a simple [[placket]] front opening and a &quot;camp collar&quot; - a one-piece [[Collar (clothing)|collar]] (no collar band) that can be worn open and spread or closed at the neck with a button and loop. It usually has a straight hemmed bottom falling at hip level, not intended to be tucked into trousers. It is often the base for fancier fabrics such as [[bowling shirt]]s, [[aloha shirt]]s, or various other Hawaiian/tropically inspired weaves and patterns.

==History==
The ancient version of skirt or ''Ghagri'' evolved from ''Bhairnivasani'', which in turn evolved from the ''Antariya'' when stitched on one side became tabular and was worn gathered together at the waist, and held by a girdle. This was one of the earliest forms of a stitched skirt. It was worn using drawstring or nada. 

==Variations==
The ghagri was a narrow skirt six feet long the same length as original antariya. This style can still be seen worn by [[Jain]] nuns in [[India]].

In Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka it is known as Langa and part of the dress [[Langa Voni]].

[[File:Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres - Comtesse d'Haussonville - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|right|[[Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres]] depicts the [[Louise de Broglie, Countess d'Haussonville|Countess d'Haussonville]], wearing a dress]]
A '''dress''' (also known as a '''[[frock]]''' or a '''[[gown]]''') is a garment consisting of a [[skirt]] with an attached [[bodice]] (or a matching bodice giving the effect of a one-piece garment). In [[Western culture]], dresses are more often worn by [[woman|women]] and [[girl]]s.

The [[hemline]]s of dresses vary depending on the whims of [[fashion]] and the [[modesty]] or personal taste of the wearer.&lt;ref name=&quot;Davis2007&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Davis|first=Michael|title=Art of dress designing|year=2007|publisher=Global Media|location=Delhi|isbn=81-904575-7-8|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
===19th century===
Dresses increased dramatically to the [[hoopskirt]] and [[crinoline]]-supported styles of the 1860s; then fullness was draped and drawn to the back. Dresses had a &quot;day&quot; bodice with a high [[neckline]] and long sleeves, and an &quot;evening&quot; bodice with a low neckline ([[decollete]])  and very short sleeves.

Throughout this period, the length of fashionable dresses varied only slightly, between ankle-length and floor-sweeping.&lt;ref name=&quot;Davis2007&quot; /&gt;

=== 20th and 21st centuries ===
[[File:Preprom.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|A typical pre-[[prom]] gathering, with girls in dresses, and boys in tuxedos]]

Beginning around 1915, [[hemline]]s for daytime dresses left the floor for good. For the next fifty years  fashionable dresses became short (1920s), then long (1930s), then shorter ([[World War II|the War Years]] with their restrictions on fabric), then long (the &quot;[[Christian Dior S.A.#The &quot;New Look&quot;|New Look]]&quot;).

Since the 1970s, no one dress type or length has dominated fashion for long, with short and ankle-length styles often appearing side-by-side in fashion magazines and catalogs. &lt;ref&gt;[http://womenshistorynetwork.org/blog/?p=2804 changing hemlines]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Usage==

In most varieties of [[formal wear|formal]] [[dress code (Western)|dress codes]] in Western cultures, a dress of an appropriate style is mandatory for women. They are also very popular for special occasions such as [[prom]]s or [[wedding]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Pundir|first=Nirupama|title=Fashion technology : today and tomorrow|year=2007|publisher=Mittal Publications|location=New Delhi|isbn=81-8324-203-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; For such occasions they remain the de facto standard attire for most women.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[File:Clara Bow portrait.JPG|right|thumb|[[Clara Bow]] in a backless dress, mid-1920s]]
A '''backless dress''' is a [[dress]] designed to expose the wearer's [[human back|back]]. A backless dress is most commonly worn on formal occasions or as [[evening gown|evening wear]] or as [[wedding dress]]es and can be of any length, from a [[haltertop]] to a [[miniskirt]]-length to floor-length.

== Evolution ==
Backless dresses first appeared in the 1920s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.backlessweddingdresses.org/ History]&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1930s, the style became associated with the [[sun tanning]] fashions of the time, and the backless dress was a way of showing off a tan, usually without tan lines. The wearer usually had to be slim to be able to pull off the effect.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fashion-era.com/stylish_thirties.htm 1930s Fashion History]&lt;/ref&gt; In December 1937, the actress [[Micheline Patton]] was controversially filmed from behind while wearing a backless dress in the final episode of the early [[BBC]] fashion documentary ''[[Clothes-Line]]''.&lt;ref name=taylor2&gt;Taylor, Lou, ''Establishing Dress History'', chapter 2 (Manchester 2002) ISBN 0-7190-6639-5&lt;/ref&gt; The illusion of nudity led to outraged viewers writing in to complain, and [[Pearl Binder]], who co-presented the show, quipped &quot;Grandmamma looks back but Micheline has no back to be seen.&quot;&lt;ref name=taylor2/&gt;

== Styles ==
A backless dress can be held up in a number of ways. The most common is by a single piece of cloth or strap which passes behind the wearer's [[neck]], [[halterneck]]-style.&lt;ref&gt;Starpulse.com: [[AnnaLynne McCord]] [http://www.starpulse.com/news/media/AnnaLynne-McCord-backless-1.jpg wearing a backless dress]&lt;/ref&gt; The neck strap can itself be covered by the wearer's [[hair]], leaving the impression from behind that nothing is holding the dress up. Alternatively, the dress may be held up by short sleeves or by a single or two [[spaghetti strap]]s, which hold the dress up at the [[shoulder]]s. A stick-on dress or [[nude netting]] are other ways that a dress can be held up.&lt;ref&gt;[[Olivia Wilde]] used nude netting dress at the Emmy Awards: [http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_EZHn9YzGKL0/Srf2XYbIrOI/AAAAAAAAAfY/OBDyEnxxToo/s320/olivia-wilde-emmy-awards-2009.jpg Front view] and [http://www.stylebyme.net/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/olivia_wilde_arri3.jpg back view]&lt;/ref&gt; 

The amount of the back exposed by a backless dress can also vary, with some styles leaving the upper or upper and middle back uncovered, and exposing the [[shoulder blades]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kennaugh.com/Pink_backless_draped_dress_2.jpg Pink backless draped dress]&lt;/ref&gt; Some backless dresses plunge nearly to the buttocks.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.1designer-clothing.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/11/heidi-butt-crack11.jpg Plunging backless dress]&lt;/ref&gt;

The backless style is also found in the [[choli]], the upper garment worn by [[Indian people|Indian]] women along with [[sari]]s and [[ghagra]]s.

== Breast support ==
Breast support may be an issue for many women when wearing a backless dress, but nevertheless most women choosing this style of top prefer to go braless. [[List of brassiere designs|Bra designs]] are available that offer breast support with backless dresses. Some bra designs use convertible styles, [http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/318sRaN9CtL._SL500_AA280_.jpg adhesive bras], underwire and [http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41I4bU8JEpL.jpg strapless bras]. Some bra designs can also be worn by women with larger cup sizes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://elanimagemanagement.com/html/elan-blog/?p=119 Elan Image Consulting: A Great Bra for ‘Busty’ Women]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://elanimagemanagement.com/html/elan-blog/wp-content/uploads/image/FWD101_maidenform_backless_bra%281%29.jpg &quot;Breakthrough Backless Bra&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Putting on a bench shirt.jpg|thumb|Powerlifters pulling on a bench shirt.]]

A '''bench shirt '''is a stiff supportive [[shirt]], used to improve performance in the [[bench press]], most often in [[powerlifting]] competitions. Bench shirts are usually made of [[polyester]], [[denim]], or [[canvas]] and come in single- or multi-ply thicknesses. The extremely tight fit of a bench shirt supports the weightlifter's shoulders and [[deltoid muscle]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Levin, Josh, &quot;[http://www.slate.com/id/2104915/ One Giant Lift for Mankind: The race for the 1,000-pound bench press.]&quot;, ''Slate,'' 9 Aug. 2004. Retrieved 8 August 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Different [[Powerlifting#International_Federations|powerlifting federations]] have different rules governing allowed equipment—for example, the only supportive equipment allowed by the 100% Raw Powerlifting Federation for bench press is a leather belt,&lt;ref&gt;100% Raw Powerlifting Federation [http://www.rawpowerlifting.com/pdf/rules.pdf Rules] (PDF), p. 4. Retrieved 8 August 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; whereas the International Powerlifting Federation stipulates that support shirts must be &quot;of one ply stretch material&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;International Powerlifting Federation [http://www.powerlifting-ipf.com/Technical-Rules.50.0.html Technical Rules] (PDF), p. 12. Retrieved 4 January 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; As the same lifter's performance may vary significantly depending on the presence and design of a bench shirt (for example, [[Scot Mendelson]], whose shirted bench press record is 1030&amp;nbsp;lbs,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.powerliftingwatch.com/records/shw-men All-Time Powerlifting Records], ''Powerlifting Watch.''&lt;/ref&gt; while his unshirted best is 715&amp;nbsp;lbs), records across different federations or categories may not be directly comparable. A bench press performed without the usage of a bench shirt is referred to as a &quot;raw&quot; or &quot;unequipped&quot; lift.

      <text xml:space="preserve">An '''engagement party''' is a party held to celebrate a couple's recent [[engagement]] and to help future wedding guests to get to know one another.{{cn|date=September 2014}} Traditionally, the [[bride]]'s parents host the engagement party, but many modern couples host their own celebration.

==History==
Originally, engagement parties had the appearance of normal parties at which the [[father]] of the bride-to-be made a surprise announcement of the engagement to his guests.  The engagement party had the purpose of sharing the [[engagement]] news with family members and friends. Therefore, it was not a traditional gift-giving occasion, as none of the guests were supposed to be aware of the engagement until after their arrival.

In [[ancient Greece]], an engagement party was a [[commercial transaction]]. It was essentially an [[oral contract]], made between the man who gave the woman in marriage (usually her father) and the [[Bridegroom|groom]].&lt;ref name=&quot;C&quot;&gt;[http://www.courant.com/technology/chi-0402290253feb29,0,3051196.story A perfect union? Marriage has seen many makeovers], [[Hartford Courant]], Ron Grossman, February 29, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; The [[bride]] was not present.&lt;ref name=&quot;C&quot;/&gt;

A [[Jewish culture|Jewish]] engagement party is known as a ''vort'' ({{lang-yi|word}}). Breaking a ceramic [[Plate (dishware)|plate]] at a ''vort'' is customary, symbolizing the permanence of marriage and mirroring the [[Jewish wedding#Breaking the glass|breaking of a glass]] at a Jewish wedding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ohr.edu/ask_db/ask_main.php/180/Q4/ |title=A Smashing Engagement |website=Ask the Rabbi |publisher=[[Ohr Somayach, Jerusalem|Ohr Somayach]] |access-date=16 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern times===
In modern times, an engagement party may celebrate a previously publicized engagement.  It is a party like any other, except that usually toasts or speeches are made to announce the upcoming [[wedding]].

While it varies, an engagement party takes place at the beginning of the process of planning a wedding. It is often thrown at the couple's home or at the home of a close friend or relative of the couple.  Gifts are never obligatory, and if one is brought, it should be small and less expensive than a typical [[wedding anniversary#Celebration and gifts|wedding gift]].&lt;ref name=&quot;MartinMartin2010&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author1=Jacobina Martin|author2=Judith Martin|title= Miss Manners' Guide to a Surprisingly Dignified Wedding|url= http://books.google.com/books?id=gSggUrFCgNsC&amp;pg=PA50|date= 11 January 2010|publisher=W. W. Norton|isbn=978-0-393-07715-5|pages= 50–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[United States]], engagement parties are currently a more common practice in the [[Northeastern United States | Northeast]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Reasons Why Engagement Parties are common in NY than Bachelor Parties|url = http://www.thebachelorscode.com/why-engagement-parties-are-common-in-ny-than-bachelor-parties/|accessdate = 2015-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; particularly in the [[New York metropolitan area|New York area]], though they are becoming more common in the [[Southeastern United States | Southeast]] as well.{{cn|date=November 2014}} In most other parts of the country relatively few couples have them.  Unlike publishing the [[banns of marriage]], an engagement party has never been required.

In [[Africa]], what is now known as an ''engagement party'' may in fact be the last remnant of the traditional, pre-colonial marriage ceremony itself. Such is the case with the [[Yoruba people]] and their [[bride-price]] [[Yoruba culture#Wedding|rites]] and the [[Nguni people]] and their [[lobola]] practices.

{{Costume}}

A '''dance costume''' is the clothing worn by a [[dancer]] when performing before an audience. A dance costume may be custom designed for use in a specific [[work of art|dance work]], or it may have a traditional design, such as those used in some [[ceremonial dance|ceremonial]] and [[folk dance]]s. Typically, dance costumes are designed to harmonize with the dance and not hinder the movements of the dancer.

When created for a specific work, a costume may be designed to expose or enhance the lines formed by the dancer's body, or to express the [[choreographer]]'s artistic vision, or to engage the audience, or combinations of these. A costume may portray or relate to some characteristic, mood, or theme of the dance. It may fit loosely or it may be form-fitting to emphasize the form of the dancer's body.&lt;ref name=&quot;Penrod&quot; /&gt; Costumes are designed in accordance with aesthetic requirements, the anticipated movements of the dancer, and budget. Various people may collaborate in designing a costume, including the choreographer, [[costume designer]], costume maker (seamstress), and dancer.

==History==
In the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, [[Marie Camargo]] influenced changes in dance costumes by abandoning the traditional corset and dancing barefoot with exposed arms and legs.&lt;ref name=&quot;Penrod&quot; /&gt; Later, Duncan introduced a new look to dance costumes, inspired by the Greeks, of tunics and scarves that conformed to body shape and exposed body lines.&lt;ref name=&quot;Penrod&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ArtOfProduction&quot; /&gt;

==Design==

===Material===
[[File:Beo Beyond Costume design.jpg|thumb|220px|A lighted dance costume.]]
The amount of light a material absorbs and reflects may be a factor in material selection. Also, dance is about movement, so the way a fabric hangs or moves on the dancer is important.&lt;ref name=&quot;GuideToDanceProduction&quot; /&gt; Lightweight materials such as [[silk]] move faster and easier and tend to flow around the body. Stretchable fabrics such as [[jersey]], [[silk]], [[Chiffon (fabric)|chiffon]], [[Georgette (fabric)|Georgette]], and [[Lycra]] are commonly used because they don't restrict movement. Natural materials such as [[Cotton]] or [[silk]] are typically used when the costume is to be dyed because they absorb dye well. Stiff fabric is typically used to create a boxy, square, or immobile look.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cooper&quot; /&gt;

===Color===

Costume color can be used isolate a dancer, and a costume's colors usually contrast with the lighting, accessories and props used in the dance.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ellfeldt&quot; /&gt; Also, color can influence audience emotions and, as a result, costume colors may be chosen according to their relevance to the emotions expressed in the dance. For example, violet may impart a cold feeling and red may evoke a warm feeling.&lt;ref name=&quot;GuideToDanceProduction&quot; /&gt; Colors can also be symbolic; for example, green creates a feeling of envy and white evokes purity. &lt;ref name=&quot;ArtOfProduction&quot; /&gt; Costumes will sometimes incorporate layers of colors that are revealed when the dancer moves.&lt;ref name=&quot;ArtOfProduction&quot; /&gt;

Costume colors may be used to enhance body line and form, and they may be chosen to complement the dancer's body shape or skin color. Darker colors can make the dancer appear slimmer, whereas lighter colors tend to make the dancer appear larger.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cooper&quot; /&gt; Loud prints or bold color combinations are often avoided as they can distort the body lines and, in the case of tights, tend to make the dancer look larger.&lt;ref name=&quot;Penrod&quot; /&gt;  Also, strong, intense colors may tire the eyes.&lt;ref name=&quot;GuideToDanceProduction&quot; /&gt; Color transitions are often implemented using gradients, as sharp color contrasts tend to visually chop the body into sections.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cooper&quot; /&gt;

===Texture and Pattern===
Costume texture and patterns can emphasize or minimize parts of the dancer's body. For example, vertical lines visually lengthen and thin the dancer's body, and horizontal lines shorten and widen it.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cooper&quot; /&gt; Costume textures and patterns are created using shading, patching, [[tie-dyeing]], and [[appliqué]] techniques such as drawing with a fabric pen or painting on the fabric, spraying the fabric, or stitching onto the fabric. Stencils are commonly used when drawing or spraying onto costume fabric. When applying appliqué to stretchable material, the dancer will typically wear the costume so that the design will not be distorted.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cooper&quot; /&gt;

===Footwear===

Some dance styles require a specific type of [[dance shoe]]. Shoes are usually chosen to harmonize with the costume, with consideration for safety and injury avoidance. In some cases, the footwear may blend with the outfit so it will not draw attention to the feet. If the dance involves a significant amount of turning, the footwear will typically cover the balls of the feet to enable the dancer to turn more easily.&lt;ref name=&quot;GuideToDanceProduction&quot; /&gt;

===Construction===

Dance costumes are designed so that dancers can move in them as required without damaging them. For example, if a dancer will be lifted, the costume will typically be designed in such a way that the lifter's fingers are unlikely to catch on it. In some cases, the armhole is cut unusually high to ensure free movement at the [[armpit]].

Costumes frequently have special construction features and may also have accessories such as false sleeves, collars, cuffs, wristbands, and shawls.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cooper&quot; /&gt; Often, a costume must accommodate quick changes; this is usually facilitated with [[Velcro]] or hook fasteners.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cooper&quot; /&gt; In some costumes the bottom of the fabric is weighted so that it will move in a stately fashion.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ellfeldt&quot; /&gt; Lining may be used to place a costume in a specific era or [[ethnic group]]&lt;ref name=&quot;GuideToDanceProduction&quot; /&gt; and give form, qualities of movement and direction, and accentuate points of interest.&lt;ref name=&quot;Joiner&quot; /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">A '''top''' is [[clothing]] that covers at least the [[chest]], but which usually covers most of the upper human body between the [[neck]] and the [[waist]]line.&lt;ref&gt;Encarta [https://web.archive.org/web/20110525130055/http://encarta.msn.com/dictionary_1861720883/top.html]&lt;/ref&gt; The bottom of tops can be as short as mid-torso, or as long as mid-thigh. Men's tops are generally paired with [[trousers|pants]], and women's with [[trousers|pants]] or [[skirts]]. Common types of tops are [[t-shirt]]s, [[blouse]]s and [[shirts]].

== Design ==
The [[neckline]] is the highest line of the top, and may be as high as a head-covering [[Hood (headgear)|hood]], or as low as the [[waist]]line or bottom [[hem]] of the top. A top may be worn loose or tight around the bust or waist, and may have [[sleeve]]s or [[shoulder strap]]s, [[spaghetti strap]]s (noodle straps), or may be [[strap]]less. The back may be covered or bare. Tops may have straps around the waist or neck, or over the shoulders.

'''Maternity clothing''' is worn by women in some cultures as an adaptation to changes in body size during [[pregnancy]].

==History==
[[File:Attributed to Marcus Gheeraerts II - Portrait of an Unknown Lady - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|right|A waistless maternity dress fits a pregnant woman in late 16th century Elizabethan England.]]
[[File:Maternity dress, ca. 1880.jpg|thumbnail|Maternity dress (ca. 1880), Jacoba de Jonge-Collection in MoMu, Antwerp / Photo by Hugo Maertens, Bruges]]
Dresses did not follow a wearer's body shape until the [[Middle Ages]]. When western European dresses began to have [[seam (sewing)|seam]]s, affluent pregnant women opened the seams to allow for growth. The [[Baroque]] ''Adrienne'' was a waistless pregnancy gown with many folds. In the time around the Adrienne dress, women wore men’s waist coasts. This clothing had laced vents in the back that allowed the wearer to adjust the size of the coat as she needed.&lt;ref name=&quot;Maternity History&quot;/&gt; The maternity dressed changed during the Georgian period and became practical. “The billowing fabric found in the Adrienne dress was again used in this era to accommodate changing bodies, but bibs were added at the bust line to permit breast feeding.” &lt;ref name=&quot;Maternity History&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Mannering|first=Lindsay|title=A Brief History Of Maternity Clothes|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/lindsay-mannering/a-brief-history-of-matern_b_156618.html|publisher=Huffingtonpost|accessdate=11 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Apron]]s were also worn, to close the opening left by jackets. 19th century maternity clothing was tailored to hide pregnancy.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.kostuem.waszmann.de, ''[http://www.kostuem.waszmann.de/english/Galleries/Maternity_Wear/A_little_History_of__Maternity/body_a_little_history_of__maternity.htm A few Facts about the History of Maternity Wear]'', retrieved 8 April 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

For many decades during the 20th century, maternity wear was considered a &quot;fashion backwater.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Cocozza&quot;&gt;Cocozza, Paula, ''[http://shopping.guardian.co.uk/clothes/story/0,,2125549,00.html I still want to be me]'', the Guardian, 13 July 2007, retrieved 8 April 2008&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pinafore]]s were the most common style and were often sold through nursery shops. Maternity clothing hasn't generally been considered a potentially profitable area for most major clothing manufacturers.  This is due to a belief that many women wouldn't purchase clothes intended for only a few months of wearing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | year = 2006 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=6qSx2UrQ_H0C&amp;pg=PA173&amp;dq=%22maternity+wear%22&amp;ei=tAL7R43qI6istAPnxpiFCg&amp;sig=x4FWcgyBGAVy2q8rWrV9iJmnyh4 | title = 100 Great Businesses and the Minds Behind Them | author = Ross, Emily and Holland, Angus | page = 173 | publisher = Sourcebooks, Inc. | ISBN = 1-4022-0631-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, with wide media interest in celebrity pregnancies beginning in the late 1990s, the maternity wear market grew 10% between 1998 and 2003.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cocozza&quot;/&gt; In 2006, Kate Bostock of Marks &amp; Spencer said the demand for maternity clothes was growing because &quot;Nowadays women are working during pregnancy, and travelling, and going to the gym, so their clothing needs are greater and more diverse.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Cartner-Morley, Jess, ''[http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2006/feb/28/clothes.retail New maternity lines]'', the Guardian, 28 February 2006, retrieved 8 April 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

Further developments in maternity clothing styles have meant that many maternity tops are also made to enable discreet nursing, extending the usable life of maternity clothes beyond just the period whilst pregnant.

==Cultural trends in maternity wear==
Maternity clothes around the world have been undergoing significant changes. In both Eastern and Western cultures, there is greater demand for fashionable maternity clothes. In Western cultures the influence of celebrity culture&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.smh.com.au/lifestyle/fashion/hollywood-redefines-maternity-wear-20090505-at9c.html Hollywood redefines maternity wear]'', Sydney Morning Herald, 5 May 2009, retrieved 26 February 2011&lt;/ref&gt; means that pregnant women in the public eye are taking the lead on maternity fashion.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Associated Press&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Celebrities Make Pregnancy Seem Glamorous|url=http://www.today.com/id/12466527/ns/today-today_style/t/celebrities-make-pregnancy-seem-glamorous/#.U1waVSirb9s|publisher=The Associated Press|date=26 April 2006|accessdate=26 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As a result, pregnant women are no longer trying to hide or disguise their &quot;baby bumps&quot;, instead choosing to wear garments which closely fit their new shape, often emphasising the bust and abdominal area. Fashion bloggers have caught on to the shift in perception too and began regularly discuss new styles and fabrics designed with the pregnant form in mind.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.cefashion.net/category/maternity-fashion/ Maternity Fashion at cefashion.net]'', Maternity-wear discussion, retrieved 16 July 2014&lt;/ref&gt; High-tech fabrics such as elastane are the material of choice for maternity wear in Western cultures as they allow garments to be form-fitting while allowing the abdominal area to expand as necessary.

Women in Eastern cultures, however, have maintained a much greater sense of modesty when it comes to maternity wear. In both the Islamic and Asian cultures, maternity wear is much less fitted, hemlines are longer and necklines higher. Modern Islamic maternity wear uses fabrics with brighter colours and bolder prints.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/iranian-designers-seek-islamic-chic-20100223-oy47.html Iranian designers seek Islamic chic]'', Sydney Morning Herald, 16 July 2007, retrieved 26 February 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Aside from cultural modesty, Chinese women have sometimes sought to hide their second pregnancy in less shapely clothes because Chinese policy has dictated that they can only have one child. In Chinese and Japanese cultures, there is a fear of radiation from devices such as computers and mobile phones, especially during pregnancy. Even though there is no evidence to support this (according to WHO&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.who.int/peh-emf/about/WhatisEMF/en/index1.html What are electromagnetic fields?]'', World Health Organization, retrieved 26 February 2011&lt;/ref&gt;), Asian maternity wear is often manufactured from “anti-radiation” fabrics.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/bizchina/2008-09/11/content_7018945.htm Bringing anti-radiation clothing to future mothers]'', China Daily, 11 September 2008, retrieved 26 February 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legislative Influences on the Increase in Maternity Fashion in the 1990s==
Pregnancy fashion took a dramatic turn in the 1990s, increasing the presence of baby bumps and tight fitted maternity wear. Not coincidentally this shift occurred during a time of major change for women in America. In 1993, the Family and Medical Leave Act was passed by President Clinton which had been in the works for 9 years prior. This act protected women's jobs during pregnancy, giving women more freedom to show off their pregnancies.

This legislation allowed workers to have job protected leave for 12 weeks in the face of medical emergency and pregnancies. Up until this point, women were in danger of losing their jobs if they got pregnant.&lt;ref name=JSTOR&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dudley|first=Adrriane|title=The Family Medical Leave Act: An Overview and Analysis|journal=The Urban Lawyer|volume=26|issue=1|pages=83–98|accessdate=8 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unsurprisingly, maternity fashion's main aim at this point in time was concealment.  The Pregnancy Discrimination Act of 1979 only offered pregnant women a degree of temporary disability protection. This act was an amendment to Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pregnancy Discrimination Act PDAHistorical Perspective Comments&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=PDA-Historical Perspective|accessdate=8 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The amendment was ratified because of the court case General Electric V. Gilbert where an employer offered disability benefits that did not cover pregnancy. In fact, many business associations tried to argue against this coverage on the basis that pregnancy was a voluntary condition. This controversy took place during a time when 45 percent of the working class were women but only 25 percent of insurance plans had built in sick leave for pregnancy or pregnancy related illness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bell|first=Lisa|title=Government Support for Working Families and for Communities: Family and Medical Leave as a Case Study|url=http://www.nationalpartnership.org/research-library/work-family/fmla/fmla-case-study-lenhoff-bell.pdf|publisher=National Partnership For Working Families and Communities|accessdate=8 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Before this act was passed, many women were fired on the grounds of their pregnancy. Women now had more job security during pregnancy and actually had government protected maternity leave. Interestingly, at the same time as these laws were being passed maternity fashion changed drastically.  Fashion during pregnancy began to show off baby bumps with tight clothing. Currently, magazine articles discuss stylish mothers-to-be in figure hugging bodycon dresses, and shifts that hug their blossoming bump beautifully.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Associated Press&quot;/&gt;

==Maternity Clothing Designers==

In the United States, there are a handful of companies that comprise the majority of the maternity clothing market. The two largest are [[Liz Lange|Liz Lange Maternity]] and [[Destination Maternity]] which includes brands Motherhood, Pea in the Pod, Oh Baby and more. Popular clothing makers Gap and Old Navy also have a line of maternity clothes. Designer brands Citizens of Humanity, Seven For All Mankind and Joes Jeans make some maternity clothing as well.

==Cost Of Maternity Clothing ==

Maternity clothing purchased from retail and department stores is in line or slightly higher with the cost of women's non-maternity apparel. Considering the short amount of time these items are worn, they can be considered very expensive by some women. In poorer countries and even in the United States, some women who cannot afford or simply don't want to spend large amounts of money on maternity clothing will simply wear either larger, looser clothing or even their husband's clothing.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ourfamilyworld.com/2012/09/26/10-best-ways-to-save-money-on-maternity-clothes//&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, some women buy second hand maternity clothes via yard sales and also used/consignment maternity clothes stores.

==Innovations in Styling of Maternity Clothing ==
In recent years there have been a number of innovations in the design of maternity clothing, creating increased comfort and style for women.  In western countries, one contributing factor is the role of professional women and the need to have professional business clothing up to the birth of the child.

'''Street fashion''' is [[fashion]] that is considered to have emerged not from studios, but from the grassroots. Street fashion is generally associated with [[youth culture]], and is most often seen in major urban centers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Urban Style and Tips|url=http://www.urbfash.com/2011/10/urban-style-and-tips.html|publisher=UrbFash}}&lt;/ref&gt; Magazines and Newspapers like the [[New York Times]] and [[Elle magazine|Elle]] commonly feature candid photographs of individuals wearing urban, stylish clothing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Cercone|first1=Katie|title=Today's Fashion|url=http://www.revoltmagazine.org/Issue_01/Articles/TODAYS_FASHION_article.htm|accessdate=20 November 2014|agency=Revolt Magazine|issue=Volume 1 Issue 1|publisher=Public Art Squad Project|date=2012|quote=Cindy Hinant, a visual artist whose daily trek through Soho makes her a regular target for amateur blogarazzi stalking women for photo copy, remarks, &quot;Street fashion has made me both paranoid and vain. Last week I had my photo taken twice in one day by two different magazines for their street fashion whatever. Now when I’m wearing something that I think is awesome I’m disappointed not to be stopped to have my picture taken.&quot;}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Japanese street fashion]] sustains multiple simultaneous highly diverse fashion movements at any given time. Mainstream fashion often appropriates street fashion trends as influences. Most major [[youth subculture]]s have had an associated street fashion. Examples include:

* [[Hippie]]s ([[denim]], bohemian style, long hair, flower power and psychedelic imagery, flared trousers)
* [[Teddy Boy]]s (drape jackets, drainpipe trousers, crepe shoes)
* [[Punk fashion]] (ripped clothing, safety pins, bondage, provocative T-shirt slogans, Mohican hairstyle)
* [[Skinhead]]s (short-cropped hair, fitted jeans, [[Ben Sherman]] button-up shirts, [[Fred Perry]] [[polo shirts]], [[Harrington jacket]]s, [[Dr. Martens]] boots)
* [[Gothic fashion]] (black clothing, heavy coats, [[poet shirt]]s, big boots, makeup)
* [[Preppy#Fashion|Preppy]] ([[Argyle (pattern)|argyle]] [[sweater]]s, [[chinos]], [[madras (cloth)|madras]], [[Nantucket Reds]], [[button down]] [[Oxford (cloth)|Oxford cloth]] shirts, and [[boat shoes]])
* [[Hip hop fashion]] (ultra-baggy pants, ECKO, [[Tribal Gear]], [[Southpole (clothing)|South Pole]], Avirex, [[FUBU]], Sean Jean, [[Nike, Inc.|NIKE]])
* [[Hipster (contemporary subculture)|Hipster]] ([[glasses]], [[jeans]], [[beanie (seamed cap)|beanie]]s, [[sneaker (footwear)|sneaker]]s, [[Necktie|ties]], [[suspenders]])
* [[Rastafari movement|Rasta]] (African-inspired clothing, [[rastacap]], [[dreadlocks]])
* [[Greaser (subculture)]] (Levis 501 [[jeans]], [[T-shirts]], [[leather jackets]], [[sunglasses]], [[Cowboy boots]] or [[motorcycle boots]], [[hair gel]])
* [[Urban culture|Urban]] (colorful apparel, large accent [[jewelry]], [[skinny jeans]], [[jackets]], T-shirts)
* [[Feminine]] ([[dresses]], [[hat]]s, [[sunglasses]], hand bags, floral prints)
* [[Kawaii]] ( tutu skirts, pastel and pink colors, anime inspirated accessories ( wild hair clips, bows) )

[[File:Giacomo di Chirico Ministrant.jpg|thumb|right|180px|''[[Altar server|Il ministrante]]'', by [[Giacomo di Chirico]] (1844–1883).]]

[[Vestments]] are [[liturgy|liturgical]] garments and articles associated primarily with the [[Christianity|Christian]] religions, especially the [[Latin Rite]] and other [[Roman Catholic]]s, [[Eastern Orthodox]], [[Anglicans]], [[Methodists]], and [[Lutheran]] Churches.  Other groups also make use of vestments, but this was a point of [[vestments controversy|controversy]] in the [[Protestant Reformation]] and sometimes since - notably during the [[Ritualism|Ritualist controversies]] in England in the 19th century. [[Clerical clothing]] is non-[[Liturgy|liturgical]] [[clothing]] worn exclusively by [[clergy]]. It is distinct from [[vestment]]s in that it is not reserved specifically for services.

Adherents of [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] and other sects within the broader [[Latter Day Saint Movement]] often receive special garments at or around the age of eighteen. The garments, which are worn at all times under typical clothing, date back to the early days of [[Mormonism]], originating with [[Mormon]] founder and prophet, [[Joseph Smith, Jr.]], and have evolved over time. Members believe that wearing these garments can protect them from physical and spiritual danger, and serve to remind them of covenants they have made with God and [[Jesus Christ]].

==Ecumenicism==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Peacemalas.JPG|thumb|right|Peace Mala Bracelets]] --&gt;
{{main|Peace Mala}}
A Peace Mala is a symbolic bracelet used to promote the message of the [[Ethic of reciprocity|Golden Rule]] of mutual respect recognised by many spiritual paths. It consists of 16 beads, forming a double rainbow, which represent [[Christianity]], [[Buddhism]], [[Sikhism]], [[Islam]], [[Judaism]], [[Bahá'í Faith|Bahá'í]], [[International Society for Krishna Consciousness|ISKCON]], [[Zoroastrianism]], [[Folk religion|Tribal and Native Religions]], [[Jainism]], [[Earth religion|Earth Religions]], [[Taoism]], [[Hinduism]] and [[Bön#Yungdrung Bön|Yungdrung Bön]], with the central white bead representing the wearer and whatever path they may follow.&lt;ref name=bbcbracelets /&gt;

==Judaism==
[[File:Red String.jpg|thumb|right|180px|Red string in Kabbalah.]]
A [[kippah]] is a cloth head covering worn by Jewish males during prayer or other ritual services. Some wear it every day. In the United States, most synagogues and Jewish funeral services keep a ready supply of kipot for the temporary use of visitors who have not brought one.

[[Tzitzit]] are specially knotted ritual fringes, or tassels worn by some Jewish men and boys. Tzitzit are attached to the four corners of the [[tallit]] (Jewish prayer shawl).

The [[tichel]] is a headscarf worn by some Jewish women. Some women wear them during prayer and religious rituals; some women wear them every day. 

The [[gartel]] is a belt used by some Jewish men during prayer. &quot;Gartel&quot; is Yiddish for &quot;belt.&quot;

Some Jewish men wear a [[frock coat]] during prayer and other specific occasions. It is commonly worn by rabbis and Jewish religious leader in public. The coat is known as a frak, a sirtuk, or a kapotteh.

In Jewish Mysticism, wearing a thin [[red string (Kabbalah)|red string]] (as a type of [[Amulet|talisman]]) is a custom, popularly thought to be associated with [[Judaism]]'s [[Kabbalah]], in order to ward off misfortune brought about by an &quot;[[evil eye]]&quot;  (''עין הרע'' in Hebrew). In [[Yiddish]] the red string is called a ''roite bindele''. The red string itself is usually made from thin [[red]] [[wool]] [[yarn|thread]]. It is worn, or tied, as a type of [[bracelet]] or &quot;band&quot; on the left [[wrist]] of the wearer (the receiving side).&lt;ref name=bbcbracelets&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/4233623.stm |title=Do you know your awareness bracelets? |accessdate=2008-04-28 |date=2005-02-04 |publisher=[[BBC]] News Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Islam==
[[Islam and clothing|Dress in Islam]] varies from country to country. The Quranic sura ''[[An-Nur]]'' (&quot;The Light&quot;) prescribes [[modesty]] in dress. These prescriptions have been interpreted differently in different regions of the Islamic world: in many countries a headscarf is usual, whereas in [[Saudi Arabia]] the [[niqab]] is typical, and in [[Afghanistan]] and parts of [[Pakistan]] the [[burqa]] is common.

The knee area, called the ''gota'' in [[Urdu]], is often elaborately embroidered in [[zari]] and [[zardozi]] work.  Each leg of a traditional gharara is made from over 12 metres of fabric,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.india-seminar.com/2007/575/575_laila_tyabji.htm Handcrafting a Culture]&lt;/ref&gt; often silk brocade (see [[Farshi Pajama]]).

Ghararas originated in [[Awadh]] region of [[Uttar Pradesh]] during the era of the [[Nawab of Awadh|Nawabs]].  During the late 19th and early 20th centuries, it was considered everyday attire among Muslim women of [[Hindi Belt]] particularly among women of Nawab and Taluqedars families. They were representative of the status of the person wearing them. 

Although they are not worn as everyday garment today as they once were, they still remain as popular wedding attire among Muslim women of [[Hindi Belt]] and also among Urdu speaking immigrates in [[Pakistan]] &amp; [[Bangladesh]]. Ghararas were also made popular in Pakistan &amp; Bangladesh, in the 1950s and 60s with popular public figures like [[Fatima Jinnah]] and Begum [[Rana Liaquat Ali Khan]] wearing them.

[[File:Trousers-colourisolated.jpg|thumb|upright|A man wearing trousers]]
'''Trousers''' ('''pants''' in North America) are an item of [[clothing]] worn from the waist to the ankles, covering both legs separately (rather than with cloth extending across both legs as in [[robe]]s, [[skirts]], and [[dress]]es).

In the UK the word &quot;pants&quot; generally means [[underwear]] and not trousers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |quote=pants pl. n. 1. Brit. an undergarment reaching from the waist to the thighs or knees. 2. the usual U.S. name for trousers. |title=Collins English Dictionary |editor=Hanks, Patrick |location =London |publisher=Collins |year=1979 |isbn=0-00-433078-1 |page=1061}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Shorts]] are similar to trousers, but with legs that come down only to around the area of the knee, higher or lower depending on the style of the garment. To distinguish them from shorts, trousers may be called &quot;long trousers&quot; in certain contexts such as [[school uniform]], where tailored shorts may be called &quot;short trousers&quot;, especially in the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.ianhowardschooluniforms.co.uk/acatalog/school_short_trousers.html |title= Short Trousers |publisher=Ian Howard |location= London |accessdate=30 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.choirschool.com/westminster_cathedral_choir_school_uniform.html |publisher= Westminster Cathedral Choir School |location= London |title= What to bring to school |accessdate=30 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In most of the [[Western world]], trousers have been worn since ancient times and throughout the [[Medieval]] period, becoming the most common form of lower-body clothing for adult males in the modern world, although shorts are also widely worn, and [[kilt]]s and other garments may be worn in various regions and cultures. [[Breeches]] were worn instead of trousers in early modern Europe by some men in higher classes of society.&lt;!--hidden because unclear whether vandalism or simply incomprehensible; neither leg curving or invisionment is in any dictionary at onelook.com Before 1235, trousers were called leg curving and were typically worn during normal days. They were banned in church because of their invisionment by priests.{{clarification needed|date=November 2015}}--&gt; Since the mid-20th century, trousers have increasingly been worn by women as well. [[Jeans]], made of denim, are a form of trousers for casual wear, now widely worn all over the world by both sexes. Shorts are often preferred in hot weather or for some sports and also often by children and teenagers. Trousers are worn on the hips or waist and may be held up by their own fastenings, a [[belt (clothing)|belt]] or [[suspenders]] (braces). [[Leggings]] are [[form-fitting]] trousers, of a clingy material, often [[knitting|knitted]] [[cotton]] and [[spandex]] (elastane).

==Terminology==
{{refimprove section|date=July 2012}}
In the United Kingdom and Ireland the words &quot;trousers&quot;, or &quot;slacks&quot;, were historically used for women's trousers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/kecks |title=kecks - definition of kecks in English from the Oxford dictionary |website=Oxforddictionaries.com |date= |accessdate=6 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Scotland, trousers are occasionally known as ''[[trews]]'', which is the historic root of the word 'trousers'. Trousers are also known as ''[[breeks]]'' in [[Scots Language|Scots]], a word related to ''breeches''. The item of clothing worn under trousers is [[underpants]]. The standard form 'trousers' is also used, but it is sometimes pronounced in a manner approximately represented by &quot;tru:zɨrz&quot;, which is possibly a throwback to the Gaelic word truis which the English word originates from.

In North America and Australia ''pants'' is the general category term, whereas ''trousers'' (sometimes ''slacks'' in Australia and the United States) often refer more specifically to [[tailor]]ed garments with a waistband, [[belt (clothing)|belt]]-loops, and a [[fly (clothing)|fly]]-front. So informal elastic-waist knitted garments would be called ''pants'', but not ''trousers'' (or ''slacks'').

North Americans call undergarments ''underwear'', ''underpants'', ''undies'', ''jockey shorts'', ''shorts'', ''long johns'' or ''panties'' (the last are women's garments specifically) to distinguish them from other pants that are worn on the outside. The term ''[[Undergarment|drawers]]'' normally refers to undergarments, but in some dialects, may be found as a synonym for &quot;breeches&quot;, that is, trousers. In these dialects, the term ''underdrawers'' is used for undergarments. Many North Americans refer to their undergarments by their type, such as ''[[boxer shorts|boxers]]'' or ''[[briefs]]''.

In Australia, men's underwear also has various informal terms including ''under-dacks'', ''undies'', ''dacks'' or ''jocks''. In [[New Zealand]] men's underwear is known as &quot;undies&quot;, or &quot;y-fronts&quot;.

In parts of northern England, especially the areas historically part of Lancashire, the word 'pants' is used instead of 'trousers', with the word 'trousers' often specifically referring to formal garments. In some places, such as Liverpool, the terms 'kecks' or 'kegs' may also be used.

Various people in the [[fashion industry]] use the words ''trouser'' or ''pant'' instead of ''trousers'' or ''pants''. This is nonstandard usage. The words &quot;trousers&quot; and &quot;pants&quot; are ''[[pluralia tantum]]'', nouns that generally only appear in plural form—much like the words &quot;scissors&quot; and &quot;tongs&quot;. However, the singular form is used in some compound words, such as ''trouser-leg'', ''trouser-press'' and ''trouser-bottoms''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldwidewords.org/qa/qa-pai1.htm |title=Pair of pants |publisher=World Wide Words |date=28 April 2001 |accessdate=6 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jeans]] are trousers typically made from [[denim]] or [[Dungaree (fabric)|dungaree]] cloth. [[Skin-tight clothing|Skin-tight]] leggings are commonly referred to as [[tights]].

==History==
===Prehistory===
There is some evidence, from [[figurative art]], of trousers being worn in the [[Upper Paleolithic]], as seen on the figurines found at the Siberian sites of [[Mal'ta-Buret' culture|Mal'ta and Buret']].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Sarah M. |last=Nelson |title=Gender in archaeology: analyzing power and prestige |volume=9 |series=Gender and Archaeology |publisher=Rowman Altamira |location= |year=2004 |isbn=978-0-7591-0496-9 |page=85 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The oldest known trousers are found at the Yanghai cemetery in [[Turpan]], [[Xinjiang]], China, dated to the period between the 13th and the 10th century BC. Made of wool, the trousers had straight legs and wide crotches, and were likely made for horseback riding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Beck |first1=Ulrike |last2=Wagner |first2=Mayke |last3=Li |first3=Xiao |last4=Durkin-Meisterernst |first4=Desmond |last5=Tarasov |first5=Pavel E. |title=The invention of trousers and its likely affiliation with horseback riding and mobility: A case study of late 2nd millennium BC finds from Turfan in eastern Central Asia |journal=Quaternary International |date=22 May 2014 |doi=10.1016/j.quaint.2014.04.056 |url= http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1040618214002808 |accessdate=9 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.sciencenews.org/article/first-pants-worn-horse-riders-3000-years-ago |title=First pants worn by horse riders 3,000 years ago |doi=10.1016/j.quaint.2014.04.056 |publisher=Science News |date= |accessdate=6 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Trousers first enter [[recorded history]] in the 6th century BC, with the appearance of [[horse people|horse-riding]] [[Eurasian nomads]] from [[Central Asia]], in [[Greek ethnography]]. At this time, [[East Asia|Eastern]] and [[Central Asia]]n peoples such as the [[Bactrians]], [[Armenia]]ns, Tigraxauda [[Scythians]] and Xiongnu [[Hunnu]], are known to have worn them.&lt;ref&gt;Payne, Blanche.

The [[ancient Greeks]] used the term &quot;ἀναξυρίδες&quot; (''anaxyrides'') for the trousers worn by [[Eastern world|Eastern]] nations&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Da%29nacuri%2Fdes ἀναξυρίδες], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus Digital Library&lt;/ref&gt; and &quot;σαράβαρα&quot; (''sarabara'') for the loose trousers worn by the Scythians.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dsara%2Fbara σαράβαρα], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus Digital Library&lt;/ref&gt; However, they did not wear trousers since they thought them ridiculous,&lt;ref&gt;Euripides, ''Cyclops'', 182&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Aristophanes, ''Wasps'', 1087&lt;/ref&gt; using the word &quot;θύλακοι&quot; (''thulakoi''), pl. of &quot;θύλακος&quot; (''thulakos''), &quot;sack&quot;, as a slang term for the loose trousers of Persians and other orientals.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dqu%2Flakos θύλακος], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus Digital Library&lt;/ref&gt;

Republican [[Rome]] viewed the draped clothing of [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] and [[Minoan civilization|Minoan]] ([[Crete|Cretan]]) culture as an emblem of civilisation and disdained trousers as the mark of barbarians.&lt;ref&gt;Lever, James. ''Costume and Fashion: A Concise History''. Thames and Hudson, 1995, 2010. p. 50.&lt;/ref&gt;  As the Empire expanded beyond the [[Mediterranean]] basin, however, the greater warmth provided by trousers led to their adoption.&lt;ref&gt;Payne, Blanche (1965). ''History of Costume''. Harper &amp; Row. p. 97&lt;/ref&gt; Two types of trousers eventually saw widespread use in Rome: the ''[[Feminalia]]'', which fit snugly and usually fell to knee or mid-calf length,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fashionencyclopedia.com/fashion_costume_culture/The-Ancient-World-Rome/Feminalia.html &quot;Feminalia.&quot;], ''The Fashion Encyclopedia''. Retrieved 10 October 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; and the ''[[Braccae]]'', a loose-fitting trouser that was closed at the ankles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fashionencyclopedia.com/fashion_costume_culture/The-Ancient-World-Rome/Braccae.html |title=Braccae - Fashion, Costume, and Culture: Clothing, Headwear, Body Decorations, and Footwear through the Ages |website=Fashionencyclopedia.com |date=24 July 2003 |accessdate=6 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both garments were adopted originally from the [[Celts]] of Europe, although later familiarity with the Persian [[Near East]] and the [[Teutons]] increased acceptance.  Feminalia and Braccae both began use as military garments, spreading to civilian dress later, and were eventually made in a variety of materials including leather, wool, cotton and silk.&lt;ref&gt;Lever, James (1995, 2010). ''Costume and Fashion: A Concise History''. Thames and Hudson. p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Medieval Europe===
Trousers of various designs were worn throughout the Middle Ages in Europe, especially by men. Loose-fitting trousers were worn in [[Byzantium]] under long [[tunics]],&lt;ref&gt;Payne, Blanche. ''History of Costume''. Harper &amp; Row , 1965. p. 124&lt;/ref&gt; and were worn by many tribes, such as the Germanic tribes that migrated to Western Roman Empire in the [[Late Antiquity]] and [[Early Middle Ages]], as evidenced by both artistic sources and such relics as the 4th-century costumes recovered from the [[Thorsberg]] bog (see illustration).&lt;ref&gt;Payne, Blanche. ''History of Costume''. Harper &amp; Row , 1965. Pp. 136–138&lt;/ref&gt; Trousers in this period, generally called ''brais'', varied in length and were often closed at the cuff or even had attached foot coverings, although open-legged pants were also seen.&lt;ref&gt;Lever, James. ''Costume and Fashion: A Concise History''. Thames and Hudson, 1995, 2010. p. 51.&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 8th century there is evidence of the wearing in Europe of two layers of trousers, especially among upper-class males.&lt;ref&gt;Payne, Blanche. ''History of Costume''. Harper &amp; Row , 1965. p. 142&lt;/ref&gt; The under layer is today referred to by costume historians as &quot;drawers&quot;, although that usage did not emerge until the late 16th century. Over the drawers were worn trousers of wool or linen, which in the 10th century began to be referred to as breeches in many places. Tightness of fit and length of leg varied by period, class, and geography. (Open legged trousers can be seen on the [[Normans|Norman]] soldiers of the [[Bayeux Tapestry]].)&lt;ref&gt;Payne, Blanche. ''History of Costume''. Harper &amp; Row , 1965. pp. 142, 154&lt;/ref&gt;

Although [[Charlemagne]] (742–814) is recorded to have habitually worn trousers, donning the Byzantine tunic only for ceremonial occasions,&lt;ref&gt;Einhard. ''The Life of Charlemagne''. University of Michigan Press, 1960.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lever, James. ''Costume and Fashion: A Concise History''. Thames and Hudson, 1995, 2010. pp. 50–51.&lt;/ref&gt; the influence of the Roman past and the example of Byzantium led to the increasing use of long tunics by men, hiding most of the trousers from view and eventually rendering them an undergarment for many. As undergarments, these trousers became briefer or longer as the length of the various medieval outer garments changed, and were met by, and usually attached to, another garment variously called [[Hose (clothing)|hose]] or [[stockings]].

In the 14th century it became common among the men of the noble and knightly classes to connect the hose directly to their [[pourpoint]]s&lt;ref&gt;Payne, Blanche. ''History of Costume''. Harper &amp; Row, 1965. p. 180&lt;/ref&gt; (the padded under jacket worn with armoured breastplates that would later evolve into the [[doublet (clothing)|doublet]]) rather than to their drawers. In the 15th century, rising hemlines led to ever briefer drawers&lt;ref&gt;Lever, James. ''Costume and Fashion: A Concise History''. Thames and Hudson, 1995, 2010. p. 58.&lt;/ref&gt; until they were dispensed with altogether by the most fashionable elites who joined their skin-tight hose back into trousers.&lt;ref&gt;Payne, Blanche. ''History of Costume''. Harper &amp; Row, 1965. p. 207&lt;/ref&gt; These trousers, which we would today call tights but which were still called hose or sometimes joined hose at the time, emerged late in the 15th century and were conspicuous by their open crotch which was covered by an independently fastening front panel, the [[codpiece]]. The exposure of the hose to the waist was consistent with 15th century trends, which also brought the pourpoint/doublet and the [[shirt]], previously undergarments, into view,&lt;ref&gt;Payne, Blanche. ''History of Costume''. Harper &amp; Row, 1965. p. 200&lt;/ref&gt; but the most revealing of these fashions were only ever adopted at court and not by the general population.

Men's clothes in Hungary in the 15th century consisted of a shirt and trousers as underwear, and a [[dolman]] worn over them, as well as a short fur-lined or sheepskin coat. Hungarians generally wore simple trousers, only their colour being unusual; the dolman covered the greater part of the trousers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mek.oszk.hu/01900/01919/html/index20.html|title=Pannonian Renaissance|website=Mek.oszk.hu|accessdate=6 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Europe before the 1900s===
Around the turn of the 16th century it became conventional to separate hose into two pieces, one from the waist to the crotch which fastened around the top of the legs, called trunk hose, and the other running beneath it to the foot.  The trunk hose soon reached down the thigh to fasten below the knee and were now usually called &quot;[[breeches]]&quot; to distinguish them from the lower-leg coverings still called ''hose'' or, sometimes ''stockings''.  By the end of the 16th century, the codpiece had also been incorporated into breeches which featured a ''fly'' or ''fall front'' opening.

As a modernisation measure, Tsar [[Peter the Great]] issued a decree in 1701 commanding every Russian, other than clergy and peasant farmers, to wear trousers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://college.cengage.com/history/primary_sources/world/edicts_and_decrees.htm|title=Edicts and Decrees|publisher=Cengage Learning|accessdate=14 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[French Revolution]], male citizens of France adopted a working-class costume including ankle-length trousers, or pantaloons (from a [[Commedia dell'Arte]] character named ''[[Pantalone]]'')&lt;ref&gt;''Italian Culture in the Drama of Shakespeare and His Contemporaries'', ed. Michele Marrapodi 2007&lt;/ref&gt; in place of the aristocratic knee-breeches. The new garment of the revolutionaries differed from that of the ''ancien regime'' upper classes in three ways: it was loose where the style for breeches had most recently been form-fitting, it was ankle length where breeches had generally been knee-length for more than two centuries, and they were open at the bottom while breeches were fastened. This style was introduced to England in the early 19th century, possibly{{Or|date=September 2009}} by [[Beau Brummell]], and by mid-century had supplanted breeches as fashionable street wear.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last1= Gill |first1= Eric |authorlink1= Eric Gill |title= Trousers &amp; The Most Precious Ornament |url= |accessdate= |year= 1937 |publisher= Faber and Faber |location= London |isbn= |oclc= 5034115 |doi= |id= |chapter= |chapterurl= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt; At this point, even knee-length pants adopted the open bottoms of trousers (see [[shorts]]) and were worn by young boys, for sports, and in tropical climates. Breeches proper survived into the 20th century as [[court dress]], and also in baggy mid-[[calf]] (or three-quarter length) versions known as [[plus-fours]] or [[Knickerbockers (clothing)|knickers]] worn for active sports and by young schoolboys. Types of breeches are still worn today by [[baseball]] and [[American football]] players.

Sailors may have played a role in the worldwide dissemination of trousers as a fashion. In the 17th and 18th centuries, sailors wore baggy trousers known as ''[[galligaskins]]''. Sailors also pioneered the wearing of [[jeans]], trousers made of [[denim]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} These became more popular in the late 19th century in the [[American West]] because of their ruggedness and durability.

Starting around the mid-19th century, [[Wigan]] pit brow girls scandalised [[Victorian era|Victorian society]] by wearing trousers for their work at the local [[coal mine]]s. They wore skirts over their trousers and rolled them up to their waists to keep them out of the way. Although [[pit brow women|pit brow lasses]] worked above ground at the pit-head, their task of sorting and shovelling coal involved hard manual labour, so wearing the usual long skirts of the time would have greatly hindered their movements.

===Medieval Korea===
{{main|hanbok}}
The Korean word for trousers, ''[[baji (clothing)|baji]]'' (originally ''pajibaji'') first appears in recorded history around the turn of the 15th century, but pants may have been in use by Korean society for some time. From at least this time pants were worn by both sexes in Korea. Men wore trousers either as outer garments or beneath skirts, while it was unusual for adult women to wear their pants (termed ''[[sokgot]]'') without a covering skirt. As in Europe, a wide variety of styles came to define regions, time periods and age and gender groups, from the unlined ''gouei'' to the padded ''sombaji''.&lt;ref&gt;Lee, Kyung Ja, and Hong Na Young and Chang Sook Hwan, translated by Shin Jooyoung.

Although women had been wearing trousers for outdoor work thousands of years earlier in the Western world, by the time of Christianization it had become taboo for women to wear trousers. It was Eastern culture that inspired French designer Paul Poiret (1879–1944) to be one of the first to design pants for women. In 1913, Poiret created loose-fitting, wide-leg trousers for women called harem pants, which were based on the costumes of the popular opera ''Sheherazade''. Written by Nikolai [[Rimsky-Korsakov]] in 1888, Sheherazade was based on a collection of legends from the Middle East called 1001 Arabian Nights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fashionencyclopedia.com/fashion_costume_culture/Modern-World-1930-1945/Trousers-for-Women.html#ixzz2QpJAvVcR|title=Trousers for Women|website=Fashionencyclopedia.com|accessdate=6 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 20th century women air pilots and other working women often wore trousers. Frequent photographs from the 1930s of actresses [[Marlene Dietrich]] and [[Katharine Hepburn]] in trousers helped make trousers acceptable for women.  During [[World War II]], women working in factories and doing other forms of &quot;men's work&quot; on war service wore trousers when the work demanded it. In the post-war era, trousers became acceptable casual wear for gardening, the beach, and other leisurely pursuits. Further, in Britain during World War II, because of the rationing of clothing, many women took to wearing their husbands' civilian clothes, including their trousers, to work while their husbands were away from home serving in the armed forces. This was partly because they were seen as practical workwear and partly to allow women to keep their clothing allowance for other uses. As this practice of wearing trousers became more widespread and as the men's clothing wore out, replacements were needed. By the summer of 1944, it was reported that sales of women's trousers were five times more than they had been in the previous year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldwar2exraf.co.uk/Online%20Museum/Museum%20Docs/clothing3.html |title=Clothing3 |publisher=World War 2 Ex RAF |date= |accessdate=6 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1919, [[Luisa Capetillo]] challenged mainstream society by becoming the first woman in Puerto Rico to wear trousers in public. Capetillo was sent to jail for what was then considered to be a crime, but, the judge later dropped the charges against her.

In the 1960s, [[André Courrèges]] introduced long trousers for women as a fashion item, leading to the era of the [[pantsuit]] and [[designer jeans]] and the gradual erosion of social prohibitions against girls and women wearing trousers in schools, the workplace and in fine restaurants.

==Parts of trousers==
[[File:Trouser-parts.svg|thumb|upright|Parts of trousers]]

===Pleats===
[[Pleats]] just below the waistband on the front typify many styles of formal and casual trousers, including [[Suit (clothing)|suit]] trousers and [[khakis]]. There may be one, two, three, or no pleats, which may face either direction. When the pleats open towards the pockets they are called reverse pleats (typical of most trousers today) and when they open toward the fly they are known as forward pleats.

===Cuffs===
Trouser-makers can finish the legs by [[hem]]ming the bottom to prevent fraying.{{citation needed|date=February 2011}} Trousers with [[turn-ups]] (cuffs in American English), after hemming, are rolled outward and sometimes pressed or stitched into place.

===Fly===
{{Main|Fly (clothing)}}
A fly is a covering over an opening join concealing the mechanism, such as a [[zipper]], [[velcro]] or buttons, used to join the opening. In trousers, this is most commonly an opening covering the [[groin]], which makes the pants easier to put on or take off. The opening also allows men to [[urination|urinate]] without lowering their trousers.

Trousers have varied historically in whether or not they have a fly. Originally, [[Hose (clothing)|hose]] did not cover the area between the legs. This was instead covered by a doublet or by a [[codpiece]]. When breeches were worn, during the Regency period for example, they were fall-fronted (or broad fall). Later, after trousers (pantaloons) were invented, the fly-front (split fall) emerged.&lt;ref&gt;Croonborg, Frederick: ''The Blue Book of Men's Tailoring''. Croonborg Sartorial Co. New York and Chicago, 1907. p. 123&lt;/ref&gt; The panelled front returned as a sporting option, such as in riding breeches, but is now hardly ever used, a fly being by far the most common fastening. Most flies now use a zipper, though button-fly pants continue to be available.

===Trouser support===
At present, most trousers are held up through the assistance of a [[Belt (clothing)|belt]] which is passed through the '''belt loops''' on the waistband of the trousers. However, this was traditionally a style acceptable only for casual trousers and work trousers; suit trousers and formal trousers were suspended by the use of [[Suspenders|braces]] (''suspenders'' in American English) attached to buttons located on the interior or exterior of the waistband. Today, this remains the preferred method of trouser support amongst adherents of classical British tailoring. Many men claim this method is more effective and more comfortable because it requires no cinching of the waist or periodic adjustment.

==Society==

In modern Western society, males customarily wear trousers and not skirts or dresses. There are exceptions, however, such as the ceremonial Scottish [[kilt]] and Greek [[fustanella]], as well as robes or robe-like clothing like the [[cassock]]s of clergy and the academic robes, both rarely worn today in daily use. (See also [[Men's skirts]].)[[File:Convertible Ventilated Trousers shown with one leg cover removed.jpg|upright|thumb|Convertible Ventilated Trousers shown with one leg cover removed]]

Based on [[Book of Deuteronomy|Deuteronomy]] 22:5 in the [[Bible]] (&quot;The woman shall not wear that which pertaineth unto a man&quot;), some groups, including the Amish, Hutterites, some Mennonites, some Baptists, a few Church of Christ groups, and most Orthodox Jews, believe that women [[dress code|should not wear]] trousers, but only [[skirt]]s and [[dress (garment)|dresses]]. These groups do permit women to wear [[underpants]] as long as they are hidden.  By contrast, many Muslim sects approve of pants as they are considered more modest than any skirt that is shorter than ankle length. However, some mosques require ankle length trousers for both Muslims and non-Muslims on the premises.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.szgmc.ae/en/img/Mosque-Manners.jpg |format=JPG |title=Mosque Manners : Dress Code |website=Szgmc.ae |accessdate=6 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among certain groups, low-rise, baggy trousers exposing [[underwear]] became [[fashion]]able; for example, among [[Skateboarding|skaters]] and in 1990s [[hip hop fashion]]. This fashion is called [[Sagging (fashion)|sagging]] or, alternatively, &quot;busting slack.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;busting_slack&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.onlineathens.com/stories/082607/news_20070826123.shtml |title=Huckaby: Pants off to the kids busting slack at school |publisher=Online Athens |date=26 August 2007 |accessdate=6 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Cut-offs'' are homemade [[shorts]] made by cutting the legs off trousers, usually after holes have been worn in fabric around the knees. This extends the useful life of the trousers. The remaining leg fabric may be hemmed or left to fray after being cut.

==Laws==
===France===
In 2013, a bylaw requiring women in Paris, France to ask permission from city authorities before &quot;dressing as men&quot;, including wearing trousers (with exceptions for those &quot;holding a bicycle handlebar or the reins of a horse&quot;) was declared officially revoked by France's Women's Rights Minister, [[Najat Vallaud-Belkacem]].

In 2014, an Indian family court in [[Mumbai]] ruled that a husband objecting to his wife wearing a [[kurta]] and [[jeans]] and forcing her to wear a [[sari]] amounts to cruelty inflicted by the husband and can be a ground to seek divorce.&lt;ref name=&quot;gulfnews1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author=PTI |url=http://gulfnews.com/news/asia/india/wife-s-jeans-ban-is-grounds-for-divorce-india-court-rules-1.1353273 |title=Wife's jeans ban is grounds for divorce, India court rules |publisher=GulfNews.com |date=28 June 2014 |accessdate=28 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The wife was thus granted a divorce on the ground of cruelty as defined under section 27(1)(d) of Special Marriage Act, 1954.&lt;ref name=&quot;gulfnews1&quot;/&gt;

===Italy===
In [[Rome]] in 1992, a 45-year-old driving instructor was accused of rape. When he picked up an 18-year-old girl for her first driving lesson, he allegedly raped her for an hour, then told her that if she was to tell anyone he would kill her. Later that night she told her parents and her parents agreed to help her press charges. While the alleged rapist was convicted and sentenced, the [[Court of Cassation (Italy)|Italian Supreme Court]] overturned the conviction in 1998 because the victim wore tight jeans. It was argued that she must have necessarily have had to help her attacker remove her jeans, thus making the act [[consensual]] (&quot;because the victim wore very, very tight jeans, she had to help him remove them...and by removing the jeans...it was no longer rape but consensual sex&quot;).  The Italian Supreme Court stated in its decision “it is a fact of common experience that it is nearly impossible to slip off tight jeans even partly without the active collaboration of the person who is wearing them.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Faedi|first=Benedetta|title=Rape, Blue Jeans, and Judicial Developments in Italy|journal=Columbia Journal of European Law|year=2009|url=http://www.cjel.net/online/16_1-faedi/|accessdate=26 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; This ruling sparked widespread feminist protest. The day after the decision, women in the Italian Parliament protested by wearing jeans and holding placards that read “Jeans: An Alibi for Rape.” As a sign of support, the California Senate and Assembly followed suit. Soon Patricia Giggans, Executive Director of the Los Angeles Commission on Assaults Against Women, (now Peace Over Violence) made [[Denim Day]] an annual event. As of 2011 at least 20 U.S. states officially recognize Denim Day in April. Wearing jeans on this day has become an international symbol of protest. As of 2008 the [[Court of Cassation (Italy)|Italian Supreme Court]] has overturned their findings, and there is no longer a &quot;denim&quot; defense to the charge of rape.

===Malawi===
In Malawi women were not legally allowed to wear trousers under President [[Kamuzu Banda]]'s rule until 1994.&lt;ref name=&quot;Malawi in Pictures&quot;/&gt; This law was introduced in 1965.&lt;ref name=&quot;152.111.1.88&quot;/&gt;

===Puerto Rico===
In 1919, [[Luisa Capetillo]] challenged mainstream society by becoming the first woman in Puerto Rico to wear trousers in public. Capetillo was sent to jail for what was then considered to be a crime, but, the judge later dropped the charges against her.

===Turkey===
In 2013, Turkey's parliament ended a ban on women lawmakers wearing trousers in its assembly.&lt;ref name=&quot;news.yahoo.com&quot;/&gt;

===Sudan===
In Sudan, Article 152 of the Memorandum to the 1991 Penal Code prohibits the wearing of &quot;obscene outfits&quot; in public. This law has been used to arrest and prosecute women wearing trousers. Thirteen women including journalist [[Lubna al-Hussein]] were arrested in Khartoum in July 2009 for wearing trousers; ten of the women pleaded guilty and were flogged with ten lashes and fined 250 Sudanese pounds apiece. Lubna al-Hussein considers herself a good Muslim and asserts &quot;Islam does not say whether a woman can wear trousers or not. I'm not afraid of being flogged. It doesn't hurt. But it is insulting.&quot; She was eventually found guilty and fined the equivalent of $200 rather than being flogged.&lt;ref name=&quot;auto2&quot;/&gt;

===United States===
In May 2004, in [[Louisiana]], [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] and state legislator [[Derrick Shepherd]] proposed a bill that would make it a crime to appear [[in public]] [[Sagging (fashion)|wearing trousers below the waist]] and thereby exposing one's skin or &quot;intimate clothing&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
The Louisiana bill did not pass.

In February 2005, [[Virginia]] legislators tried to pass a similar law that would have made punishable by a $50 fine &quot;any person who, while in a public place, intentionally wears and displays his below-waist undergarments, intended to cover a person's intimate parts, in a lewd or indecent manner&quot;. (It is not clear whether, with the same coverage by the trousers, exposing underwear was considered worse than exposing bare skin, or whether the latter was already covered by another law.) The law passed in the [[Virginia House of Delegates]]. However, various criticisms to it arose. For example, newspaper columnists and radio [[talk show]] hosts consistently said that since most people that would be penalised under the law would be young [[African-American]] men, the law would thus be a form of [[Discrimination#Race discrimination|racial discrimination]]. Virginia's state senators voted against passing the law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://leg1.state.va.us/cgi-bin/legp504.exe?051+ful+HB1981H1 |title=Bill Tracking - 2005 session : Legislation |website=Leg1.state.va.us |date=4 February 2005 |accessdate=6 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lociherein.blogspot.com/2005/02/50-bucks-to-freeball.html|title=LOCI-HEREIN:A Blog About Today And Tomorrow, With Insights From Yesterday.|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[California]], Government Code Section 12947.5 (part of the [[California Fair Employment and Housing Act]] (FEHA)) expressly protects the right to wear pants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://codes.lp.findlaw.com/cacode/GOV/1/2/d3/2.8/6/1/s12947.5 |title=California Government Code - GOV § 12947.5 |website=Codes.lp.findlaw.com |date= |accessdate=6 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Thus, the standard California FEHA discrimination complaint form includes an option for &quot;denied the right to wear pants.&quot;  &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dfeh.ca.gov/res/docs/RTS/RTS%20Instructions%20and%20Form%20(2-13).pdf Instructions to Obtain Right to Sue Notice by Mail], California Department of Fair Housing and Employment, February 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Knickers1.jpg|thumb|Women's [[panties]] or knickers]]
[[File:Boxer 002.jpg|thumb|Men's [[boxer shorts]] and [[boxer briefs]]]]
'''Undergarments''' are items of [[clothing]] worn beneath outer clothes, usually in direct contact with the skin, although they may comprise more than a single layer. They serve to keep outer garments from being soiled or damaged by [[Human waste|bodily excretions]], to lessen the [[friction]] of outerwear against the skin, to shape the body, and to provide concealment or support for parts of it. In cold weather, [[long underwear]] is sometimes worn to provide additional warmth. Special types of undergarments have religious significance. Some items of clothing are designed as undergarments, while others, such as [[T-shirt]]s and certain types of shorts, are appropriate both as undergarments and as outer clothing. If made of suitable material or [[textile]], some undergarments can serve as [[nightwear]] or [[swimsuit]]s, and some are intended for [[sexual attraction]] or visual appeal.

Undergarments are generally of two types, those that are worn to cover the torso and those that are worn to cover the waist and legs, although there are also garments which cover both. Different styles of undergarments are generally worn by females and males. Undergarments commonly worn by females today include [[bra]]s and [[panties]] (known in the United Kingdom as [[panties|knickers]]), while males often wear [[briefs]], [[boxer briefs]] or [[boxer shorts]]. Items commonly worn by both sexes include T-shirts, [[sleeveless shirt]]s (also called singlets or tank tops), [[Bikini (underwear)|bikini underwear]], [[Thong (clothing)|thongs]], and [[G-string]]s.

== Terminology ==
Undergarments are known by a number of terms. ''[[wikt:underclothes|Underclothes]]'', ''underclothing''  and ''[[wikt:underwear|underwear]]'' are formal terms, while undergarments may be more casually called, in Australia, ''[[wikt:Reg Grundys|Reg Grundys]]'' ([[rhyming slang]] for ''undies'') and ''Reginalds'', and, in the United Kingdom, ''[[wikt:smalls|smalls]]'' (from the earlier ''smallclothes'') and (historically) ''unmentionables''. In the United States, women's underwear may be known as ''delicates'' due to the recommended washing machine cycle or because they are, simply put, delicate.

Women's undergarments collectively are called ''[[lingerie]]''. They also are called ''intimate clothing'' and ''[[wikt:intimate|intimates]]''.

An [[undershirt]] (''[[wikt:vest|vest]]'' in the United Kingdom) is a piece of underwear covering the [[torso]], while [[underpants]] (often ''[[wikt:pants|pants]]'' in the United Kingdom), [[wikt:drawers|drawers]], and shorts cover the [[Sex organ|genitals]] and buttocks. Terms for specific undergarments are shown in the table [[#Types and styles|below]].

Not wearing underpants under outer clothing is known in American slang as ''freeballing'' for men and as ''[[going commando]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Go commando|url=http://www.wordspy.com/words/gocommando.asp|publisher=Word Spy|date=9 April 2001|accessdate=3 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; for either sex. The act of a woman not wearing a bra is sometimes referred to as ''freeboobing''.

== Function ==
Underwear is worn for a variety of reasons. They keep outer garments from being soiled by [[perspiration]], [[urine]],&lt;ref&gt;US Patent Number 6447493&lt;/ref&gt; [[semen]], [[menstrual blood]] and [[feces]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Voelkel|first=Megan|title=Germ Warfare|newspaper=The Standard|year=2008|date=31 July 2000|accessdate=23 May 2009|url=http://www.thestandard.com.hk/news_print.asp?art_id=69373}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women's [[brassiere]]s provide support for the [[breasts]], and men's [[briefs]] serve the same function for the [[Male reproductive system (human)|male genitalia]]. A [[corset]] may be worn as a [[foundation garment]] to alter a woman's [[female body shape|body shape]]. For additional support and protection when playing sports, men often wear more tightly fitting underwear, including [[jockstrap]]s and jockstraps with cup pocket and [[jockstrap#Protective cup|protective cup]]. Women may wear [[sports bra]]s which provide greater support, thus increasing comfort and reducing the chance of damage to the [[ligament]]s of the chest during high-impact exercises such as jogging.

In cold climates, underwear may constitute an additional layer of clothing helping to keep the wearer warm. Underwear may also be used to preserve the wearer's [[modesty]] – for instance, some women wear [[camisole]]s and [[Slip (clothing)|slips]] ([[petticoat]]s) under clothes that are [[Sheer (textile)|sheer]]. Conversely, some types of underwear can be worn for sexual titillation, such as [[edible underwear]], crotchless panties and [[Thong (clothing)|thongs]].

Some items of clothing are designed exclusively as underwear, while others such as [[T-shirt]]s and certain types of shorts are suitable both as underwear and as outer clothing. The suitability of underwear as outer clothing is, apart from the indoor or outdoor climate, largely dependent on societal norms, fashion and the requirements of the law. If made of suitable material, some underwear can serve as [[nightwear]] or [[swimsuit]]s.

=== Religious functions ===
Undergarments can also have religious significance:

&lt;!--Please arrange alphabetically.--&gt;
* '''Judaism'''.  To conform with societal dress codes, the ''[[tallit katan]]'' is often worn beneath the shirt.
* '''Mormonism'''. Following their [[Endowment (Mormonism)|endowment]] in a [[Temple (Mormonism)|temple]], [[Mormonism|Mormons]] wear special [[temple garment]]s which help them to remember the teachings of the temple.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Preparing to enter the Holy Temple|url=http://www.lds.org/manual/preparing-to-enter-the-holy-temple/preparing-to-enter-the-holy-temple|publisher=[[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]]|accessdate=2 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Sikhism'''. One of the five articles of faith (''[[Five Ks|panj kakaar]]'') worn by [[Sikhism|Sikh]] men and women is a certain style of underpants similar to [[boxer shorts]] and known as the ''[[kacchera]]''.
* '''Zoroastrianism'''. Zoroastrians wear an undershirt called a ''[[Sedreh]]'' that is fastened with a sacred girdle around the waist known as a ''[[Kushti]]''.

== Fashions and trends ==

=== Not wearing underpants ===
{{Main|Going commando}}
Some people choose not to wear any underpants, a practice sometimes referred to as &quot;[[going commando]]&quot;, for comfort, to enable their outer garments (particularly those which are form-fitting) to look more flattering, to avoid creating a [[panty line]], because they find it sexually exciting, or because they do not see any need for them.

Certain types of clothes, such as [[cycling shorts]] and [[kilt]]s, are designed to be worn or are traditionally worn without underpants. This also applies for most clothes worn as [[nightwear]] and as [[swimwear]].

=== Exposed underwear ===
{{See also|Sagging (fashion)}}
Underwear is sometimes partly exposed for fashion reasons or to titillate. A woman may, for instance, allow the top of her brassiere to be visible from under her [[Collar (clothing)|collar]], or wear a see-through [[blouse]] over it. Some men wear T-shirts underneath partly or fully unbuttoned shirts.

A common style among young men is to allow the trousers to [[Sagging (fashion)|sag]] below the waist, thus revealing the waistband or a greater portion of whatever underwear the man is wearing. A woman wearing low-rise trousers may expose the upper rear portion of her thong underwear is said to display a &quot;[[whale tail]]&quot;.

== Types and styles ==

=== Market ===
In January 2008 it was reported that, according to [[market research]] firm [[Mintel]], the men's underwear market in the UK was worth [[Pound sterling|£]]674 million, and volume sales of men's underpants rose by 24% between 2000 and 2005. British manufacturers and retailers claim that most British men prefer &quot;trunks&quot;, or short boxer briefs. The director of menswear of major British retailer [[Marks &amp; Spencer]] (M&amp;S), which sells 40 million pairs of men's underpants a year, was quoted as saying that while boxer shorts were still the most popular at M&amp;S, demand was easing off in favour of hipster trunks similar in design to the [[Swimsuit#Men's swimsuits or swimming trunks|swimming trunks]] worn by actor [[Daniel Craig]] in the [[James Bond]] film ''[[Casino Royale (2006 film)|Casino Royale]]'' (2006).&lt;ref name=&quot;Independent&quot; /&gt;

=== Designers and retailers ===
A number of major [[designer label]]s are renowned for their underwear collections, including [[Calvin Klein]], [[Dolce &amp; Gabbana]] and [[La Perla (clothing)|La Perla]].

=== Ancient history ===

[[File:Les Très Riches Heures du duc de Berry juillet braies.jpg|thumb|upright|A loincloth in 1412 ''[[Très Riches Heures du Duc de Berry]]'']]
The [[loincloth]] is the simplest form of underwear; it was probably the first undergarment worn by human beings. In warmer climates the loincloth was often the only clothing worn (effectively making it an outer garment rather than an undergarment), as was doubtless its origin, but in colder regions the loincloth often formed the basis of a person's clothing and was covered by other garments. In most ancient civilizations, this was the only undergarment available.

A loincloth may take three major forms. The first, and simplest, is simply a long strip of material which is passed between the legs and then around the waist. Archaeologists have found the remains of such loincloths made of leather dating back 7,000 years.&lt;ref name=&quot;Independent&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=Rushton|first=Susie|title=A brief history of pants: Why men's smalls have always been a subject of concern|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/fashion/features/a-brief-history-of-pants-why-mens-smalls-have-always-been-a-subject-of-concern-771772.html|work=[[The Independent]] (''Extra'')|date=22 January 2008|pages=2–5|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ancient Hawaiian ''malo'' was of this form, as are several styles of the Japanese ''[[fundoshi]]''. Another form is usually called a [[cache-sexe]]: a triangle of cloth is provided with strings or loops, which are used to fasten the triangle between the legs and over the genitals. [[Egypt]]ian king [[Tutankhamun]] (1341 BC – 1323 BC) was found buried with numerous [[linen]] loincloths of this style.&lt;ref name=&quot;Independent&quot; /&gt;&lt;!--The article used to state &quot;145&quot;, but this number is currently unreferenced.--&gt; An alternate form is more [[skirt]]-like: a cloth is wrapped around the hips several times and then fastened with a [[girdle]].

Men are said to have worn loincloths in [[ancient Greece]] and [[Ancient Rome|Rome]], though it is unclear whether Greek women wore undergarments. There is some speculation that only slaves wore loincloths and that citizens did not wear undergarments beneath their [[Chiton (costume)|chitons]]. [[Mosaic]]s of the Roman period indicate that women (primarily in an athletic context, whilst wearing nothing else) sometimes wore ''strophiae'' (breastcloths) or [[brassiere]]s made of soft leather, along with ''[[Subligaculum|subligacula]]'' which were either in the form of shorts or loincloths. ''Subligacula'' were also worn by men.&lt;ref name=&quot;Independent&quot; /&gt;

The fabric used for loincloths may have been [[wool]], [[linen]] or a [[linsey-woolsey]] blend. Only the upper classes could have afforded imported silk.

The loincloth continues to be worn by people around the world – it is the traditional form of undergarment in many Asian societies, for example. In various, mainly tropical, cultures, the traditional male dress may still consist of only a single garment below the waist or even none at all, with underwear as optional, including the Far-Eastern ''[[dhoti]]'' and ''[[lungi]]'', or the Scottish [[kilt]].

[[File:Braies.jpg|thumb|left|Medieval ''[[braies]]'']]

=== Middle Ages and Renaissance ===
In the [[Middle Ages]], western men's underwear became looser fitting. The loincloth was replaced by loose, [[Trousers|trouser]]-like clothing called [[braies]], which the wearer stepped into and then laced or tied around the waist and legs at about mid-calf. Wealthier men often wore [[chausses]] as well, which only covered the legs.&lt;ref name=&quot;Independent&quot; /&gt; Braies were a type of trouser worn by Celtic and Germanic tribes in antiquity and by Europeans subsequently into the Middle Ages. In the later Middle Ages they were used exclusively as undergarments.

[[File:Tizian 081.jpg|thumb|upright|A 1532–1533 portrait by [[Titian]] of the [[Holy Roman Emperor]], [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]], in a codpiece]]

By the time of the [[Renaissance]], braies had become shorter to accommodate longer styles of chausses. Chausses were also giving way to form-fitting [[Hose (clothing)|hose]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Independent&quot; /&gt; which covered the legs and feet. Fifteenth-century hose were often particolored, with each leg in a different-coloured fabric or even more than one colour on a leg. However, many types of braies, chausses and hose were not intended to be covered up by other clothing, so they were not actually underwear in the strict sense.

Braies were usually fitted with a front flap that was buttoned or tied closed. This [[codpiece]] allowed men to [[Urination|urinate]] without having to remove the braies completely.&lt;ref name=&quot;Independent&quot; /&gt; Codpieces were also worn with hose when very short [[Doublet (clothing)|doublets]] – vest- (UK: waistcoat-) like garments tied together in the front and worn under other clothing – were in fashion, as early forms of hose were open at the [[crotch]]. [[Henry VIII of England]] began padding his codpiece, which caused a spiralling trend of larger and larger codpieces that only ended by the end of the 16th century. It has been speculated that the King may have had the [[sexually transmitted disease]] [[syphilis]], and his large codpiece may have included a bandage soaked in medication to relieve its symptoms.&lt;ref name=&quot;Independent&quot; /&gt; Henry VIII also wanted a healthy son and may have thought that projecting himself in this way would portray fertility. Codpieces were sometimes used as a pocket for holding small items.&lt;ref name=&quot;Independent&quot; /&gt;

[[File:Elizabeth Vernon big.jpg|thumb|left|upright|A lady in her private [[boudoir]]; wearing an informal embroidered jacket over her rose-pink [[corset]] or simple [[bodice]] and decorated [[petticoat]], ''c.'' 1600]]

Over the upper part of their bodies, both medieval men and women usually wore a close-fitting shirt-like garment called a [[chemise]] in France, or a smock or shift in England. The forerunner of the modern-day shirt, the chemise was tucked into a man's braies, under his outer clothing. Women wore a chemise underneath their [[gown]]s or [[robe]]s, sometimes with [[petticoat]]s over the chemise. Elaborately [[Quilting|quilted]] petticoats might be displayed by a cut-away dress, in which case they served a skirt rather than an undergarment. During the 16th century, the [[farthingale]] was popular. This was a petticoat stiffened with [[Phragmites|reed]] or [[willow]] rods so that it stood out from a woman's body like a cone extending from the waist.

Corsets also began to be worn about this time. At first they were called pairs of bodies, which refers to a stiffened decorative [[bodice]] worn on top of another bodice stiffened with [[buckram]], reeds, canes, [[Baleen|whalebone]] or other materials. These were not the small-waisted, curved corsets familiar from the [[Victorian era]], but straight-lined stays that flattened the bust.

There is a myth that [[Crusades|Crusaders]], worried about the [[fidelity]] of their wives, forced them to wear [[chastity belt]]s. There is no reference, image, or surviving belt to support this story. Most historians of this period are of the view that a chastity belt was worn to prevent sexual assault and that the woman kept the key.{{citation needed|date=January 2008}}

Men's braies and hose were eventually replaced by simple cotton, silk or [[linen]] drawers, which were usually knee-length trousers with a button flap in the front.&lt;ref name=&quot;Independent&quot; /&gt;

Medieval people wearing only tunics, without underpants, can be seen on works like [[commons:File:Pieter Bruegel the Elder – The Ass in the School – WGA03526.jpg?uselang=pt|a engraving]] by Pieter Bruegel the Elder, in the

In 2012, findings in [[Lengberg Castle]] showed that [[lace]] and [[linen]] brassiere-like garments, one of which greatly resembled the modern bra, date back to hundreds of years before it was thought to exist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Dalya Alberge |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-2174568/Austrian-dates-bras-15th-century-The-scraps-lace-castle-vault.html |title=Austrian find dates bras back to 15th century: The scraps of lace found in a castle vault &amp;#124; Mail Online |publisher=Dailymail.co.uk |accessdate=2013-07-25 |location=London |date=16 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Enlightenment and Industrial Age ===
[[File:Tight lacing.jpg|right|thumb|upright|''Tight Lacing, or Fashion Before Ease'', an early-1770s [[Satire|satirical]] drawing by John Collet]]

The invention of the [[spinning jenny]] machines and the [[cotton gin]] in the second half of the 18th century made cotton fabrics widely available. This allowed factories to [[mass production|mass-produce]] underwear, and for the first time, people began buying undergarments in stores rather than making them at home.

Women's [[History of corsets#16th to late 18th centuries|stays]] of the 18th century were laced behind and drew the shoulders back to form a high, round bosom and erect posture. Coloured stays were popular. With the relaxed country styles of the end of the century, stays became shorter and were [[Bone (corsetry)|unboned]] or only lightly boned, and were now called corsets. As tight waists became fashionable in the 1820s, the corset was again boned and laced to form the figure. By the 1860s, a tiny (&quot;wasp&quot;) waist came to be seen as a symbol of beauty, and the corsets were stiffened with whalebone or steel to accomplish this. Tight lacing of a corset sometimes led to a woman needing to retire to the [[fainting room]]. By the 1880s, the [[Victorian dress reform|dress reform]] movement was campaigning against the pain and damage to internal organs and bones caused by [[Tightlacing|tight lacing]]. Inez Gaches-Sarraute invented the &quot;health corset&quot;, with a straight-fronted bust made to help support the wearer's muscles.

The corset was usually worn over a thin shirt-like shift of linen or cotton or [[muslin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Regency nightwear: Shift|url=http://www.janeausten.co.uk/magazine/page.ihtml?pid=478&amp;step=4|publisher=[[Jane Austen|The Jane Austen Centre]]|accessdate=7 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Skirt]] styles became shorter and long drawers called [[pantalettes]] or [[wikt:pantaloons|pantaloons]] kept the legs covered. Pantalettes originated in France in the early 19th century, and quickly spread to Britain and America. Pantalettes were a form of [[leggings]] or long drawers. They could be one-piece or two separate garments, one for each leg, attached at the waist with buttons or laces. The crotch was left open for hygiene reasons.

[[File:Perfect Health Corset.png|thumb|left|&quot;Health corsets&quot; in 1883]]
As skirts became fuller from the 1830s, women wore many petticoats to achieve a fashionable bell shape. By the 1850s, stiffened [[crinoline]]s and later [[hoop skirt]]s allowed ever wider skirts to be worn. The [[bustle]], a frame or pad worn over the buttocks to enhance their shape, had been used off and on by women for two centuries, but reached the height of its popularity in the later 1880s, and went out of fashion for good in the 1890s.
Women dressed in crinolines often wore drawers under them for modesty and warmth.

Another common undergarment of the late-19th century for men, women and children was the [[union suit]]. Invented in [[Utica, New York]], and patented in 1868, this was a one-piece front-buttoning garment usually made of knitted material with sleeves extending to the wrists and legs down to the ankles. It had a buttoned flap (known colloquially as the &quot;access hatch&quot;, &quot;drop seat&quot; or &quot;fireman's flap&quot;) in the back to ease visits to the toilet. The union suit was the precursor of [[Long underwear|long johns]], a two-piece garment consisting of a long-sleeved top and long pants possibly named after American boxer [[John L. Sullivan]] who wore a similar garment in the ring.&lt;ref name=&quot;Independent&quot; /&gt;

The [[jockstrap]] was invented in 1874, by C.F. Bennett of a Chicago sporting goods company, Sharp &amp; Smith, to provide comfort and support for bicycle jockeys riding the [[cobblestone]] streets of Boston, Massachusetts.&lt;ref name=&quot;Independent&quot; /&gt; In 1897 Bennett's newly formed Bike Web Company patented and began mass-producing the Bike Jockey Strap.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History|url=http://www.bikeathletic.com/History.aspx|publisher=[[BIKE Athletic Company]]|year=2004|accessdate=7 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 1900s to 1920s ===
{{refimprove section|date=January 2012}}
[[File:Underwear1913.JPG|thumb|upright|Ladies' underwear advertisement, 1913]]
[[File:NewBritainUnderwearWashingDirections.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.8|How to handwash the New Britain Standard Hygienic Underwear, ''c.'' 1915]]

By the early 20th century, the mass-produced undergarment industry was booming, and competition forced producers to come up with all sorts of innovative and gimmicky designs to compete. The [[Hanes]] company emerged from this boom and quickly established itself as a top manufacturer of union suits, which were common until the 1930s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Independent&quot; /&gt; Textile technology continued to improve, and the time to make a single union suit dropped from days to minutes.

Meanwhile, designers of women's undergarments relaxed the corset. The invention of new, flexible but supportive materials allowed whalebone and steel bones to be removed. The emancipation or [[liberty bodice]] offered an alternative to constricting corsets, and in Australia and the UK the liberty bodice became a standard item for girls as well as women.

Men's underwear was also on the rise. Benjamin Joseph Clark, a migrant to [[Louisiana]] from [[New Jersey]], opened a [[venture capital]]ist firm named Bossier in [[Bossier Parish, Louisiana|Bossier Parish]]. One product manufactured by his firm was tightly fitting boxers that resembled modern underwear. Though the company was bankrupt by the early 1900s, it had some impact on men's underwear design.

Underwear advertising first made an appearance in the 1910s. The first underwear print advertisement in the US appeared in ''[[The Saturday Evening Post]]'' in 1911 and featured oil paintings by [[J. C. Leyendecker]] of the &quot;Kenosha Klosed Krotch&quot;. Early underwear advertisements emphasised durability and comfort, and fashion was not regarded as a selling point.

By the end of the 1910s, Chalmers Knitting Company split the union suit into upper and lower sections, effectively inventing the modern undershirt and drawers. Women wore lacier versions of this basic duo known as the camisole and tap pants.
[[File:WarnerStyle70 1922.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.4|A corset over &quot;step ins&quot; and camisole, 1922]]

In 1912, the US had its first professional underwear designer. Lindsay &quot;Layneau&quot; Boudreaux, a French immigrant, established the short-lived panty company Layneau. Though her company closed within one year, it had a significant impact on many levels. Boudreaux showed the world that an American woman could establish and run a company, and she also caused a revolution in the underwear industry.

In 1913, a New York socialite named [[Mary Phelps Jacob]] created the first modern brassiere by tying two handkerchiefs together with ribbon. Jacob's original intention was to cover the whalebone sticking out of her corset, which was visible through her sheer dress. Jacob began making brassieres for her family and friends, and news of the garment soon spread by word of mouth. By 1914, Jacob had a patent for her design and was marketing it throughout the US. Although women had worn brassiere-like garments in years past, Jacob's was the first to be successfully marketed and widely adopted.

By the end of the decade, trouser-like &quot;[[Bloomers (clothing)|bloomers]]&quot;, which were popularized by [[Amelia Jenks Bloomer]] (1818–1894) but invented by [[Elizabeth Smith Miller]], gained popularity with the so-called [[Gibson Girl]]s who enjoyed pursuits such as cycling and tennis. This new female athleticism helped push the corset out of style. The other major factor in the corset's demise was the fact that metal was globally in short supply during the First World War. Steel-laced corsets were dropped in favour of the brassiere.

Meanwhile, World War I soldiers were issued button-front shorts as underwear. The buttons attached to a separate piece of cloth, or &quot;yoke&quot;, sewn to the front of the garment, and tightness of fit was adjusted by means of ties on the sides. This design proved so popular that it began to supplant the union suit in popularity by the end of the war. [[Rayon]] garments also became widely available in the post-war period.

In the 1920s, manufacturers shifted emphasis from durability to comfort. Union suit advertisements raved about patented new designs that reduced the number of buttons and increased accessibility. Most of these experimental designs had to do with new ways to hold closed the crotch flap common on most union suits and drawers. A new woven cotton fabric called [[nainsook]] gained popularity in the 1920s for its durability. Retailers also began selling preshrunk undergarments.

Also in the 1920s, as [[hemline]]s of women's dresses rose, women began to wear stockings to cover the exposed legs. Women's bloomers also became much shorter. The shorter bloomers became looser and less supportive as the boyish [[flapper]] look came into fashion. By the end of the decade, they came to be known as &quot;step-ins&quot;, very much like modern panties but with wider legs. They were worn for the increased flexibility they afforded.

As dancing became a favourite pastime of young flappers, the [[Garter belts|garter belt]] was invented to keep stockings from falling. The increased sexual awareness of the flapper also made underwear sexier than ever before. It was the flappers who ushered in the era of lingerie.

In 1928, [[Maidenform]], a company operated by [[Ida Rosenthal]], a Russian immigrant, developed the brassiere and introduced modern cup sizes for bras.

=== 1930s and 1940s ===
[[File:Maninboxers.jpg|thumb|upright|A man wearing a pair of [[boxer shorts]]]]

Modern men's underwear was largely an invention of the 1930s. On 19 January 1935, [[Coopers Inc.]] sold the world's first briefs in Chicago. Designed by an &quot;apparel engineer&quot; named Arthur Kneibler, briefs dispensed with leg sections and had a Y-shaped overlapping fly.&lt;ref name=&quot;Independent&quot; /&gt; The company dubbed the design the &quot;Jockey&quot; since it offered a degree of support that had previously only been available from the jockstrap. Jockey briefs proved so popular that over 30,000 pairs were sold within three months of their introduction. Coopers, having renamed the company [[Jockey International|Jockey]], sent its &quot;Mascul-line&quot; plane to make special deliveries of &quot;masculine support&quot; briefs to retailers across the US. In 1938, when Jockeys were introduced in the UK, they sold at the rate of 3,000 a week.&lt;ref name=&quot;Independent&quot; /&gt;

In this decade, companies also began selling buttonless drawers fitted with an elastic waistband. These were the first true boxer shorts, which were named for their resemblance to the shorts worn by [[Boxing|professional fighters]]. Scovil Manufacturing introduced the [[snap fastener]] at this time, which became a popular addition to various kinds of undergarments.

Women of the 1930s brought the corset back, now called the &quot;[[girdle]]&quot;. The garment lacked the whalebone and metal supports and usually came with a brassiere (now usually called a &quot;bra&quot;) and attached garters.

During World War II, elastic waistbands and metal snaps gave way once again to button fasteners due to rubber and metal shortages. Undergarments were harder to find as well, since soldiers abroad had priority to obtain them. By the end of the war, Jockey and Hanes remained the industry leaders in the US, but Cluett, Peabody and Company made a name for itself when it introduced a preshrinking process called &quot;[[Sanforization]]&quot;, invented by Sanford Cluett in 1933, which came to be licensed by most major manufacturers.

Meanwhile, some women adopted the corset once again, now called the &quot;[[Waist cincher|waspie]]&quot; for the [[wasp]]-shaped [[waist]]line it gave the wearer. Many women began wearing the strapless bra as well, which gained popularity for its ability to push the breasts up and [[Cleavage enhancement|enhance cleavage]].

=== 1950s and 60s ===
Before the 1950s, underwear consisted of simple, white pieces of clothing which were not to be shown in public. In the 1950s, underwear came to be promoted as a fashion item in its own right, and came to be made in prints and colours. Manufacturers also experimented with rayon and newer fabrics like [[Dacron]], nylon and [[Spandex]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Independent&quot; /&gt; By 1960, men's underwear was regularly printed in loud patterns, or with messages or images such as cartoon characters.

Women's undergarments began to emphasize the breasts instead of the waist. The decade saw the introduction of the bullet bra pointed bust, inspired by [[Christian Dior]]'s &quot;[[Christian Dior#The New Look|New Look]]&quot;, which featured pointed cups. The original [[Wonderbra]] and [[Brassiere designs|push-up bra]] by [[Frederick's of Hollywood]] finally hit it big.  Women's panties became more colourful and decorative, and by the mid-1960s were available in two abbreviated styles called the hip-hugger and the [[bikini]] (named after the Pacific Ocean [[Bikini Atoll|island]] of that name), frequently in sheer nylon fabric.

[[Pantyhose]], also called ''tights'' in British English, which combined panties and hose into one garment, made their first appearance in 1959,&lt;ref name=Belkin1986&gt;{{cite news|last=Belkin|first=Lisa|title=Lingerie's Great Leap Forward|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1986/08/24/business/lingerie-s-great-leap-forward.html|accessdate=17 October 2012|newspaper=The New York Times|date=24 August 1986}}&lt;/ref&gt; invented by Glen Raven Mills of [[North Carolina]]. The company later introduced seamless pantyhose in 1965, spurred by the popularity of the [[miniskirt]]. By the end of the decade, the girdle had fallen out of favour as women chose sexier and lighter alternatives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Daniel Delis Hill|title=As Seen in Vogue: A Century of American Fashion in Advertising [Costume Society of America series]|location=Lubbock|publisher=Texas Tech University Press|year=2005|page=153|isbn=0-89672-534-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the emergence of the woman's movement in the United States sales for pantyhose dropped off during the later half of the 1960s having soared initially.&lt;ref name=Belkin1986 /&gt;

Underwear as fashion reached its peak in the 1970s and 1980s, and underwear advertisers forgot about comfort and durability, at least in advertising. [[Sexual attraction|Sex appeal]] became the main selling point, in swimwear as well, bringing to fruition a trend that had been building since at least the flapper era.

The [[Sleeveless shirt|tank top]], an undershirt named after the type of swimwear dating from the 1920s known as a tank suit or [[maillot]], became popular warm-weather casual outerwear in the US in the 1980s. Performers such as [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] and [[Cyndi Lauper]] were also often seen wearing their undergarments on top of other clothes.

Although worn for decades by [[exotic dancer]]s, in the 1980s the [[G-string]] first gained popularity in South America, particularly in Brazil. Originally a style of [[swimsuit]], the back of the garment is so narrow that it disappears between the buttocks. By the 1990s the design had made its way to most of the Western world, and [[Thong (clothing)|thong underwear]] became popular. Today, the thong is one of the fastest-selling styles of underwear among women, and is also worn by men.

While health and practicality had previously been emphasized, in the 1970s retailers of men's underpants began focusing on fashion and sex appeal. Designers such as [[Calvin Klein]] began featuring near-naked models in their advertisements for white [[briefs]]. The increased wealth of the [[gay community]] helped to promote a diversity of undergarment choices. In his book ''[[The Philosophy of Andy Warhol]]'' (1975),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Andy Warhol]]|title=The Philosophy of Andy Warhol: (From A to B and Back Again)|location=London|publisher=[[Orion Publishing Group|Cassell]]|year=1975|isbn=0-86018-109-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Andy Warhol]] wrote:

{{quote|I told B I needed some socks too and at least 30 pairs of Jockey shorts. He suggested I switch to Italian-style [[briefs]], the ones with the T-shaped crotch that tends to build you up. I told him I'd tried them once, in Rome, the day I was walking through a [[Elizabeth Taylor|Liz Taylor]] movie – and I didn't like them because they made me too self-aware. It gave me the feeling girls must have when they wear uplift bras.&lt;ref name=&quot;Independent&quot; /&gt;}}

Warhol liked his Jockey [[briefs]] so much that he used a pair as a canvas for one of his dollar-sign paintings.&lt;ref name=&quot;Independent&quot; /&gt;

In the UK in the 1970s, tight jeans gave briefs a continued edge over boxer shorts among young men, but a decade later boxers were given a boost by [[Nick Kamen]]'s performance in [[Levi Strauss &amp; Co.|Levi]]'s &quot;Launderette&quot; TV commercial for its [[Levi's 501 jean|501 jeans]], during which he stripped down to a pair of white boxer shorts in a public [[Self-service laundry|laundromat]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Independent&quot; /&gt; Briefs however remained popular in America from the 1950s (amongst young men) until the mid 1990s and in Australia the brief remains popular today and has become iconic.

The 1990s saw the introduction of [[boxer briefs]], which take the longer shape of boxers but maintain the tightness of briefs. [[Hip hop music|Hip hop]] stars popularized &quot;[[Sagging (fashion)|sagging]]&quot;, in which loosely fitting jeans or shorts were allowed to droop below the waist, exposing the waistband or a greater portion of boxer shorts, briefs, or boxer briefs worn underneath. The chiseled muscularity of [[Mark Wahlberg]] (then known as Marky Mark) in a series of 1990s underwear advertisements for Calvin Klein briefs led to his success as a white hip hop star and a [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood]] actor.&lt;ref name=&quot;Independent&quot; /&gt;

'''Black  Friday''' or '''Mad Friday''' is a nickname for the last [[Friday]] before [[Christmas]] in the [[United Kingdom]].

It is the most popular night for office Christmas parties, which consequently makes it one of the busiest nights in the year for ambulances and the police.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/7157423.stm BBC News, 22 December 2007: &quot;'Black Friday' keeps police busy&quot;] Re-linked 2014-12-05&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/7792652.stm BBC News, 20 December 2008: &quot;'Black Friday' keeps crews busy&quot;] Re-linked 2014-12-05&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/2008/dec/18/black-friday-party The Guardian, 18 December 2008: &quot;Ambulance service braced for 'Black Friday'&quot;] Re-linked 2014-12-05&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nursingtimes.net/whats-new-in-nursing/warning-over-alcohol-at-christmas-parties-as-black-friday-for-999-calls-looms/1954076.article Nursing Times, 18 December 2008: &quot;Warning over alcohol at christmas parties as 'Black Friday. for 999 calls looms&quot;] Re-linked 2014-12-05&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-12012042 BBC News Wales, 17 December 2010: &quot;Second snow band brings disruption across much of Wales&quot;] Re-linked 2014-12-05&lt;/ref&gt;

==Names==
The day was originally known as Black Friday. From 2013, the press began to use the term Mad Friday&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2527748/Emergency-services-busy-night-Mad-Friday-descends.html Daily Mail, 22 December 2013: &quot;'Mad Friday' fallout: Emergency services inundated as drinkers descend on towns and cities on last weekend before Christmas&quot;] Linked 2014-12-05&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title='Mad Friday': Christmas revellers given alcohol warning|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-35135284|website=BBC News|date=18 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; to avoid confusion with the American [[Black Friday (shopping)|Black Friday]] in November, which was growing increasingly popular in the UK due to marketing by American retailers.

In parts of the [[United Kingdom]], the day has been referred to as Black Eye Friday, due to unusually high number of fights that break out in bars, pubs and clubs in the area.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cumberlandnews.co.uk/cumbrian-police-braced-for-black-eye-friday-1.286376?firstComment=0&amp;commentview=1 The Cumberland News, 18 December 2008: &quot;Cumbrian Police braced for Black Eye Friday&quot;] Re-linked 2014-12-05&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cumbriacrack.com/2011/12/14/police-crackdown-on-violence-in-the-countdown-to-black-eye-friday/ Cumbria Crack, 14 December 2011: &quot;Police crackdown on violence in the countdown to ‘Black Eye Friday’&quot;] Re-linked 2014-12-05&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.real-whitby.co.uk/black-eyed-friday-by-helen-hutchinson Real Whitby, 7 December 2012: ''Black Eyed Friday In Whitby''] Re-linked 2014-12-05&lt;/ref&gt;

It is sometimes called Builders' Friday, as it is the last day of work for many construction workers.

==Safety concerns and preventive measures==

In anticipation of the festivities, police and emergency services officials begin their preparations for Black Friday early in December.  Ambulance trusts around the country plan and set up mobile &quot;drunk tanks&quot; in city centers to help lighten the load on hospitals and police cells.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Telegraph&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last1=Harley|first1=Nicola|title=Mad Friday: How police and hospitals are preparing|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/health/news/11301825/Mad-Friday-How-police-and-hospitals-are-preparing.html|accessdate=June 23, 2015|publisher=The Telegraph|date=December 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the higher end mobile units can treat up to 11 people at a time with eight beds, seats with restraint straps and two showers, and can cost up to £500,000.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Telegraph&quot; /&gt; In Manchester, temporary metal detectors, or &quot;knife arches,&quot; are erected in the busiest parts of the city to assure the public that no weapons of any kind will be tolerated.&lt;ref name=BBC&gt;{{cite news|title=Greater Manchester Police prepare for 'Mad Friday'|url=http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-manchester-12015682|accessdate=June 23, 2015|publisher=BBC News|date=December 17, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One preventative initiative in particular seems to be paying off: social media. In December 2013, Greater Manchester Police promoted using the hashtag #MadMancFriday to expose some of the embarrassing things that revelers would do in the hopes of discouraging them from getting so publicly drunk again next year.&lt;ref name=Metro&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bartlett|first1=Evan|title=Mad Friday: Binge-drinking, arrests and dancing with office chairs...Britain at its worst on its busiest night before Christmas|url=http://metro.co.uk/2013/12/21/mad-friday-binge-drinking-arrests-and-dancing-with-office-chairs-britain-at-its-worst-on-busiest-night-before-christmas-4239554/|accessdate=June 23, 2015|publisher=Metro News UK|date=December 21, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Christian Nightlife Initiatives have launched a &quot;StaySafe&quot; campaign to encourage responsible behavior via social media.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Telegraph&quot; /&gt; A 2014 report on the festivities notes that erratic behavior was toned down, as a result of the increased awareness of the ruinous effects of instantaneous social media posts.&lt;ref name=Mirror&gt;{{cite news|last1=Robson|first1=Steve|author2=Eva Simpson|title=Mad Friday: Messiest moments as Brits enjoy the Christmas spirit a bit TOO much|url=http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/mad-friday-messiest-moments-brits-4842968|accessdate=June 23, 2015|publisher=Mirror|date=December 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Daily Mail&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last1=Press Association|title=Revellers prepare for Mad Friday|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/pa/article-2878879/Christmas-party-season-set-peak.html|accessdate=June 23, 2015|publisher=Daily Mail|date=December 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''birthday''' is an occasion when a person or institution celebrates the anniversary of their birth. Birthdays are celebrated in numerous cultures, often with a gift, party, or [[rite of passage]].

Many religions celebrate the birth of their founders with special holidays (e.g. [[Christmas]], [[Buddha's Birthday]]).

Note the distinction between birth'''day''' and birth'''date''': The former, other than February 29, occurs each year (e.g. May 11), while the latter is the exact date a person was born (e.g., May 11, 1998).

==Legal conventions==

In most legal systems, one becomes designated as an adult on a particular birthday (usually between 12 and 21), and reaching age-specific milestones confers particular rights and responsibilities. At certain ages, one may become eligible to leave [[School leaving age|full-time education]], or become subject to [[military conscription]] or to enlist in the military, to [[Age of consent|consent to sexual intercourse]], to [[Age of marriage|marry]], to marry without [[parental consent]], to [[voting age|vote]], to run for elected office, to legally purchase (or consume) [[legal drinking age|alcohol]] and [[Smoking age|tobacco]] products, to purchase [[Gaming law|lottery]] tickets, or to obtain a [[Legal driving age|driver's licence]]. The [[age of majority]] is the age when minors cease to legally be considered children and assume control over their persons, actions, and decisions, thereby terminating the legal control and legal responsibilities of their parents or guardian over and for them. Most countries set majority between 18 to 21.

==Cultural conventions==
Many cultures have one or more [[coming of age]] birthdays:

[[File:Birthday girl in hat.jpg|thumb|right|Little girl in traditional birthday hat used in Canada and the U.S.]]

* In Canada and the United States, families often mark a girl's 16th birthday with a [[Sweet sixteen (birthday)|&quot;sweet sixteen&quot;]] celebration.
* In some Hispanic countries, as well as in Portuguese-speaking Brazil, the ''[[quinceañera]]'' (Spanish) or ''festa de quinze anos'' (Portuguese) celebration traditionally marks a girl's 15th birthday.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bellaonline.com/articles/art40429.asp Quinceañeras – Hispanic Culture]. Bellaonline.com. Retrieved on 2013-01-01.&lt;/ref&gt;
* In India, on a child's first birthday, their head is shaved while being held by a special fire. Removal of the hair cleanses the child of any evil in past lives, symbolizing a renewal of the soul.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.happy-birthday-wishes.eu/history-of-the-birthday-celebration/ Birthday traditions]. happy-birthday-wishes.eu&lt;/ref&gt; Hindu male children of some castes, like Brahmins, have the 12th or 13th birthday replaced with a grand &quot;thread ceremony&quot;. The child takes a blessed thread and wears it, symbolizing his coming of age. This is called the [[Upanayana]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/20090306185121/http://www.hinduyuva.org/node/83?PHPSESSID=97990cef940991e8ce42b66784afcc34 Sacred Thread Ceremony]. hinduyuva.org (2006)&lt;/ref&gt;
* In the Philippines, a coming-of-age party called a [[Philippine Debut|debut]] is held for girls on their 18th birthday, and for boys on their 21st birthday.
* In some Asian countries that follow the [[Chinese zodiac|Zodiac calendar]], there is a [[Sexagenary cycle#Overview|tradition of celebrating the 60th birthday]].
* In Korea, many celebrate a traditional ceremony of [[Korean birthday celebrations|Baek-il]] (Feast for the 100th day) and [[Doljanchi]] (child's first birthday).
* In Japan there is a [[Coming of Age Day]], for all of those who have turned 20 years of age.
* In British Commonwealth nations cards from the [[British Royal Family|Royal Family]] are sent to those celebrating their 100th and 105th birthday and every year thereafter.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.royal.gov.uk/hmthequeen/queenandanniversarymessages/anniversarymessages.aspx Queen and anniversary messages].

* In Ghana, on their birthday, children wake up to a special treat called &quot;oto&quot; which is a patty made from mashed sweet potato and eggs fried in palm oil. Later they have a birthday party where they usually eat stew and rice and a dish known as &quot;kelewele&quot;, which is fried plantain chunks.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}
* Jewish boys have a [[bar mitzvah]] on their 13th birthday. Jewish girls have a [[bat mitzvah]] on their 12th birthday, or sometimes on their 13th birthday in [[Reform Judaism|Reform]] and [[Conservative Judaism|Conservative]] Judaism. This marks the transition where they become obligated in [[Mitzvah|commandments]] of which they were previously exempted and are counted as part of the [[Minyan|community]].&lt;ref&gt;Rabbi Shraga (2000-01-17) [http://www.aish.com/jl/l/48956006.html ABC's of Bar/Bat Mitzvah]. Aish.com. Retrieved on 2013-01-01.&lt;/ref&gt;

The birthdays of historically significant people, such as national heroes or founders, are often commemorated by an official [[holiday]] marking the anniversary of their birth. 
*Catholic saints are remembered by a liturgical feast on the anniversary of their &quot;birth&quot; into heaven a.k.a. their day of death. The ancient Romans marked the anniversary of a temple dedication or other founding event as a ''[[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#dies natalis|dies natalis]]'', a term still sometimes applied to the anniversary of an institution (such as a university).

A person's Golden or Grand Birthday, also referred to as their &quot;Lucky Birthday&quot;, &quot;Champagne Birthday&quot;, or &quot;Star Birthday&quot;, {{citation needed|date=June 2013}} occurs when they turn the age of their birth day (e.g., when someone born on the 25th of the month turns 25 or when someone born on the ninth turns nine).&lt;ref&gt;[http://everything2.com/title/Golden+birthday Golden birthday@Everything2.com].

In many parts of the world{{Vague|which portions?|date=July 2013}} an individual's birthday is celebrated by a party where a specially made [[cake]], usually decorated with lettering and the person's age, is presented. The cake is traditionally studded with the same number of lit candles as the age of the individual, or a number candle representing their age. The celebrated individual will usually make a silent wish and attempt to blow out the candles in one breath; if successful, a tradition holds that the wish will be granted. In many cultures, the wish must be kept secret or it won't &quot;come true&quot;. Presents are bestowed on the individual by the guests appropriate to her/his age. Other birthday activities may include entertainment (sometimes by a hired professional, i.e. a clown, magician, or musician), and a special toast or speech by the birthday celebrant. The last stanza of [[Patty Hill]]'s and [[Mildred Hill]]'s famous song, &quot;Good Morning to You&quot; (unofficially titled &quot;[[Happy Birthday to You]]&quot;) is typically sung by the guests at some point in the proceedings. In some countries a [[piñata]] takes the place of a cake.

===Name days===
{{main|Name day}}
In some historically Roman Catholic and [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]] countries such as Italy, Spain, France, parts of Germany, Poland,  Russia, Romania, Bulgaria, Serbia, Slovakia, Czech Republic, Hungary, Greece, Lithuania, Latvia, and throughout Latin America, it is common to have a '[[name day]]'/'Saint's day'. It is celebrated in much the same way as a birthday, but it is held on the official day of a saint with the same Christian name as the birthday person; the difference being that one may look up a person's name day in a calendar, or easily remember common name days (for example, ''John'' or ''Mary''); however in pious traditions, the two were often made to concur by giving a newborn the name of a saint celebrated on its birthday, or possibly the name of a feast, for example, ''Noel'' or ''Pascal'' (French for Christmas and &quot;of Easter&quot;); as another example, [[Palmiro Togliatti|Togliatti]] got ''Palmiro'' as his first name because he was born on [[Palm Sunday]].

===Official birthdays===
[[File:Coloured lanterns at the Lotus Lantern Festival.jpg|thumb|Colored lanterns at the Lotus Lantern Festival in [[Seoul]], [[South Korea]], celebrating the anniversary of the [[Buddha]]'s birthday]]

Some notables, particularly monarchs, have an ''official birthday'' on a fixed day of the year, which may not necessarily match the day of their birth, but on which celebrations are held. Examples are:
* [[Jesus Christ]]'s traditional birthday is celebrated as [[Christmas Eve]] or [[Christmas Day]] around the world, on December 24 or 25, respectively. As some [[Eastern Christianity|Eastern]] churches use the [[Julian calendar]], December 25 will fall upon January 7 in the [[Gregorian calendar]]. These dates are traditional and probably have no connection with the actual birthday of Jesus.
* Similarly, the birthdays of the [[Virgin Mary]] and [[John the Baptist]] are liturgically celebrated on [[September 8]] and [[June 24]], especially in the [[Roman Catholic]] and [[Eastern Orthodox]] traditions (although for those Eastern Orthodox churches using the Julian calendar the corresponding Gregorian dates are [[September 21]] and [[July 7]] respectively). As with Christmas, the dates of these celebrations are traditional and probably have no connection with the actual birthdays of these individuals.
* The [[Queen's Official Birthday]] in [[Australia]], [[Fiji]], [[Canada]], [[New Zealand]], and the [[United Kingdom]].
* The [[Grand Duke's Official Birthday]] in [[Luxembourg]] is typically celebrated upon June 23. This is different from [[Henri, Grand Duke of Luxembourg|the monarch]]'s actual date of birth, which is on April 16.
* ''[[Koninginnedag]]'' in the Kingdom of the [[Netherlands]] was typically celebrated upon April 30. Queen Beatrix fixed it at the birthday of her mother, the previous queen, to avoid the winter weather associated with her own birthday in January. The present monarch's birthday is 27 April, and is also celebrated on that day and has replaced the 30th of April celebration of Koninginnedag.
* The current [[Japanese Emperor]] [[Akihito]]'s official birthday is December 23, which is a national holiday in Japan, whereas his actual date of birth is on November 12.
* The previous Japanese Emperor Showa ([[Hirohito]])'s birthday was April 29. After his death, the holiday was kept as &quot;Showa no Hi&quot;, or &quot;Showa Day&quot;. This holiday falls close to [[Golden Week (Japan)|Golden Week]], the week in late April and early May.
* [[Kim Il-sung]] and [[Kim Jong-Il]]'s birthdays are celebrated in [[North Korea]] as a national holiday.
* [[Washington's Birthday]], commonly referred to as Presidents' Day, is a [[Federal holidays in the United States|federal holiday]] in the [[United States]] that celebrates the birthday of [[George Washington]]. President Washington's birthday is observed on the third Monday of February each year. However, his actual birth date was either February 11 ([[Old Style]]), or February 22 ([[New Style]]).
* In India, every year October 2 which marks the Birthday of [[Mahatma Gandhi]], is declared as a holiday. All the liquor shops are closed across the country in honour of Gandhi not consuming liquor.
* [[Martin Luther King, Jr. Day]] is a federal holiday in the United States marking the birthday of [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]] It is observed on the third Monday of January each year, which is around the time of King's birthday, January 15.
* [[Mawlid]] is the official birthday of [[Muhammad]] and is celebrated on the 12th or 17th day of [[Rabi' al-awwal]] by adherents of Sunni and Shia Islam respectively. These are the two the most commonly accepted dates of birth of Muhammad.

==Frequency==
[[File:Birthday cake-01.jpg|thumb|A cake indicating a tenth birthday celebration]]
According to a public database of births, birthdays in the United States are quite evenly distributed for the most part, but there tend to be more births in September and October.&lt;ref&gt;[http://anybirthday.com/ Anybirthday]. Anybirthday. Retrieved on 2013-01-01.&lt;/ref&gt; This may be because there is a [[holiday season]] nine months before (as nine months is the human [[gestation period]]), or from the fact that the longest nights of the year happen in the [[Northern Hemisphere]] nine months before as well. However, it appears the holidays have more of an effect on birth rates than the winter weather; [[New Zealand]], a Southern Hemisphere country, has the same September and October peak with no corresponding peak in March and April.&lt;ref name=&quot;StatsNZ&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.stats.govt.nz/browse_for_stats/population/pop-birthdays-table.aspx |title= Most common birthday in New Zealand |publisher= Statistics New Zealand |date= 17 September 2015 |accessdate= 24 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The least common birthdays tend to fall around public holidays, such as Christmas, New Years and fixed-date holidays such as [[Independence Day (United States)|July 4]] in the US. This is probably due to hospitals and birthing centres not offering labor inductions and elective [[Caesarean section]]s on public holidays.

Based on Harvard University research of birth records in the United States between 1973 and 1999, September 16 is the most common birthday in the United States and December 25 the least common birthday (other than February 29, because of leap years).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/19/business/20leonhardt-table.html | work=The New York Times | title=How Common Is Your Birthday? | date=2006-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; More recently{{when|date=October 2013}} October 5 and 6 have taken over as the most frequently occurring birthdays.&lt;ref&gt;Christina Ng (2011-10-05) [http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/technology/2011/10/oct-5-americas-most-common-birthday/ Oct. 5: America’s Most Common Birthday] ''[[ABC News]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

In New Zealand, the ten most common birthdays all fall within a thirteen-day period, between September 19 and October 1. The ten least common birthdays (other than February 29) are December 24–27, January 1–2, [[Waitangi Day|February 6]], March 22, April 1 and [[Anzac Day|April 25]]. This is based on all live births registered in New Zealand between 1980 and 2014.&lt;ref name=&quot;StatsNZ&quot; /&gt;

According to a study by the Yale School of Public Health, positive and negative associations with culturally significant dates may influence birthrates. The study shows a 5.3 percent decrease in spontaneous births and a 16.9 percent decrease in cesarean births on Halloween, compared to other births occurring within one week before and one week after the October holiday. Whereas, on Valentine’s Day there is a 3.6 percent increase in spontaneous births and a 12.1 percent increase in cesarean births.&lt;ref&gt;Greenwood, Michael.

==Time zones and birthdays==
{{Unreferenced section|date=February 2013}}
A person's birthday is usually recorded according to the time zone of the place of birth. Thus people born in [[American Samoa]] at 11:30&amp;nbsp;pm will record their birthdate as one day before [[Coordinated Universal Time]] (UTC) and those born in the [[Samoa]] will record their birthdate one day after UTC. They will apparently be born two days apart, while some apparently older ones, may be younger in hours. Those who live in different time zones from their birth often exclusively celebrate their birthdays at the local time zone.

==Leap day==

In the [[Gregorian calendar]] (a common [[solar calendar]]), [[February]] in a [[leap year]] has 29 days instead of the usual 28, so the year lasts 366 days instead of the usual 365.

A person born on [[February 29]] may be called a &quot;[[leapling]]&quot; or a &quot;leaper&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last = Hall | first = C. | date =February 29, 2008 | article = Leap Year Babies Hop Through Hoops of Joy, Pain of Novelty Birthday | title =Detroit Free Press | accessdate = February 29, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In common years they usually celebrate their birthdays on February 28. In some situations, March 1 is used as the birthday in a non-leap year since it is the day following February 28.

Technically, a leapling will have fewer ''birthday anniversaries'' than their age in years.  This phenomenon is exploited when a person claims to be only a quarter of their actual age, by counting their leap-year birthday anniversaries only.  In [[Gilbert and Sullivan]]'s 1879 [[comic opera]] ''[[The Pirates of Penzance]]'', Frederic the pirate apprentice discovers that he is bound to serve the pirates until his 21st ''birthday'' rather than until his 21st ''year.''

For legal purposes, legal birthdays depend on how local laws count time intervals.

==In cultures and religions==

===Ancient Persia===
Accoding to [[Herodotus]] (5th century BC), of all the days in the year, the one which the [[Persian people|Persians]] celebrate most is their birthday. It was customary to have the board furnished on that day with an ampler supply than common: the richer people eat wholly baked cow, horse, camel, or donkey, while the poorer classes use instead the smaller kinds of cattle.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/herodotus-iii&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://legacy.fordham.edu/halsall/ancient/herodotus-persians.asp&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ancient Rome===
The Romans enthusiastically celebrated birthdays with hedonistic parties and generous presents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Kathryn Argetsinger|title=Birthday Rituals: Friends and Patrons in Roman Poetry and Cult|journal=Classical Antiquity|volume= 11|issue=2 |year= 1992|pages=175–193 |jstor=25010971|doi=10.2307/25010971}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===China===
Chinese birthday traditions reflect the culture's deep-seated focus on [[Chinese alchemy|longevity]] and wordplay. From the homophony between {{lang|zh|{{linktext|酒}}}} (&quot;[[Chinese alcohol|rice wine]]&quot;) and {{lang|zh|{{linktext|久}}}} (meaning &quot;long&quot; in the sense of time passing), [[osmanthus wine|osmanthus]] and other [[rice wine]]s are traditional gifts for birthdays in [[China]]. [[Longevity noodles]] are another traditional food consumed on the day,&lt;ref&gt;Li Xiaoxiang. ''Origins of Chinese People and Customs'' (2004) [http://books.google.com/books?id=l0R59sYWaCoC&amp;pg=PA101 p. 101]. Asiapac Books (Singapore). ISBN 9812293841.&lt;/ref&gt; although western-style birthday cakes are increasingly common among urban Chinese.

===Judaism===
In [[Judaism]], the perspective on birthday celebrations is disputed by various rabbis.&lt;ref&gt;[http://rchaimqoton.blogspot.com/2007/04/happy-birthday.html Reb Chaim HaQoton: Happy Birthday!] April 17, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Hebrew Bible]], the one single mention of a celebration being held in commemoration of someone's day of birth is for the Egyptian [[Pharaoh]] which is recorded in {{bibleverse||Genesis|40:20|HE}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Birthday in Torah | url=http://www.asktherabbi.org/DisplayQuestion.asp?ID=7549 | work=Just Asked | publisher=GatewaysOnline.com | accessdate=2009-03-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Rabbi]] [[Moshe Feinstein]] always acknowledged birthdays.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.myvirtualpaper.com/doc/flatbush-jewish-news/may_13_final/2010051301/18.html#4|title=Birthdays|author=Zvi (Far Rockaway)|date= 2010-05-13|work=Flatbush Jewish Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Lubavitcher Rebbe]] encouraged people to celebrate their birthdays, by gathering friends, making positive resolutions, and through various religious observances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Chabad.org|title=The Jewish Birthday|url=http://www.chabad.org/generic_cdo/aid/458473/jewish/Birthday.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Rabbi [[Yissocher Frand]], the anniversary of a person's birth is a special day for that person's prayers to be accepted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.myvirtualpaper.com/doc/flatbush-jewish-news/may_13_final/2010051301/18.html#4|title=Birthday Celebrations|author=Rechel Weingarten|date=2010-05-13|work=Flatbush Jewish Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[bar mitzvah]] of 13-year-old Jewish boys, or [[bat mitzvah]] for 12-year-old Jewish girls, is perhaps the only Jewish celebration undertaken in what is often perceived to be in coalition with a birthday. Despite modern celebrations where the secular &quot;birthday&quot; element often overshadows the essence of it as a religious rite, the essence of a bar mitzvah or bat mitzvah celebration is entirely religious in origin (i.e. the attainment of religious maturity according to Jewish law), however, and not secular. With or without the birthday celebration, the child nevertheless becomes a bar mitzvah or bat mitzvah, and the celebration may be on that day or any date after it.

===Christianity===

====Christianity: Early centuries====
[[Origen]] in his commentary &quot;On Levites&quot; writes that Christians should not only refrain from celebrating their birthdays, but should look on them with disgust.&lt;ref&gt;John Bugge (1975)

[[Early Christians]],” notes The World Book Encyclopedia, “considered the celebration of anyone’s birth to be a pagan custom.” The ancient Greeks, for instance, believed that each person had a protective spirit that attended the person’s birth and thereafter watched over him. That spirit “had a mystic relation with the god on whose birthday the individual was born,” says the book The Lore of Birthdays. Birthdays also have a long-standing and an intimate link with astrology and the horoscope.
11 Besides rejecting birthday customs on account of pagan and spiritistic roots, God’s servants of old likely rejected them on principle as well. Why? These were humble, modest men and women who did not view their arrival in the world as so important that it should be celebrated. (Micah 6:8; Luke 9:48) Rather, they glorified Jehovah and thanked him for the precious gift of life.—Psalm 8:3, 4; 36:9; Revelation 4:11.

''Virginitas: an essay in the history of a medieval ideal'', Springer ISBN 9024716950, p. 69&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Orthodox Christianity]] still prefers the celebration of name days only.

====Christianity: Medieval====
Ordinary folk celebrated their saint's day (the saint they were named after), but nobility celebrated the anniversary of their birth.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}} The &quot;Squire's Tale&quot;, one of Chaucer's Canterbury Tales, opens as King Cambuskan proclaims a feast to celebrate his birthday.&lt;ref&gt;Margaret Hallissy (1995)  [http://books.google.com/books?id=VSvLJ8tWKyQC&amp;printsec=frontcover ''A Companion to Chaucer's Canterbury Tales''], Greenwood Publishing Group ISBN 0313291896, p. 300&lt;/ref&gt;

====Christianity: Modern====
While almost all Christians accept the practice today, [[Jehovah's Witnesses]] and some [[Sacred Name]] groups refrain from celebrating birthdays due to the custom's pagan origins, its connections to magic and superstitions, and its being portrayed in a negative light in the Bible.&lt;ref&gt;''Awake!'' July 8, 2004, p. 30 &quot;Christians refrain from any celebrations or customs that continue to involve false religious beliefs or activities that violate Bible principles. For example, the Bible definitely puts birthday celebrations in a bad light.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The World Book Encyclopedia: Vol. 3, p. 416&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thercg.org/articles/abcc.html Are Birthday Celebrations Christian?]. Thercg.org. Retrieved on 2013-01-01.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Islam===
Some consider the celebration of a birthday to be a sin, as it is considered an &quot;innovation&quot; of the faith, or ''bi'dah'' while other clerics have issued statements saying that the celebration of a birthday is permissible.&lt;ref&gt;[http://en.islamtoday.net/node/618 Birthday parties | IslamToday – English]. En.islamtoday.net. Retrieved on 2013-01-01.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/2008/08/21/uk-saudi-birthdays-religion-idUKLL60146720080821|title=Birthday parties against Islam says top Saudi cleric|publisher=Reuters|accessdate=2011-07-06|author=Souhail Karam|date=2008-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some Muslims migrating to the United States adopt the custom of celebrating birthdays, especially for children, but others resist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Mona H. Faragallah, Walter R. Schumm and Farrell J. Webb|title=Acculturation of Arab-American Immigrants: An Exploratory Study|jstor=41603515|journal=Journal of Comparative Family Studies|volume= 28|issue=3|year=1997|page= 182|url=http://psycnet.apa.org/psycinfo/1997-42694-002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is also a great deal of controversy regarding celebrating Milad-ul-Nabi – the anniversary of the birth of Muhammad. While a section of Islam strongly favours it,&lt;ref&gt;Imam Jalaluddin al-Suyuti (radi Allahu anhu) [http://www.nooremadinah.net/Documents/YaMohammad/CelebratingEid-e-Milad-un-Nabi/CelebratingEid-e-Milad-un-Nabi.pdf Celebrating Eid-e-Milad-un-Nabi]. (PDF). Nooremadinah.net. Retrieved on 2013-01-01.&lt;/ref&gt; others decry such celebrations, terming them as out of the scope of Islam.&lt;ref&gt;Salman Mohammed (2011-02-06) [http://www.systemoflife.com/articles/milaad/269-milad-un-nabi-or-prophet-birthday-celebrate-or-not Milad un Nabi or Prophet Birthday : Celebrate or Not?]. Systemoflife.com Article. Retrieved on 2013-01-01.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hinduism===
Hindus celebrate the birth anniversary day every year when the day that corresponds to lunar month or solar month (Sun Signs Nirayana System – Sourava Mana Masa) of birth and has the same asterism (Star/Nakshatra) as that of the date of birth. That age is reckoned whenever Janma [[Nakshatra]] of the same month passes.

Hindus regard death to be more auspicious than birth since the person is liberated from the bondages of material society. Also, traditionally, death is celebrated on 5th and 11th day with many relatives gathering. In recent times, due to the influence of western society, birth is also part of the celebrations.

===Buddhism (Mahayana)===
{{Main|Buddha's birthday}}
Many monasteries celebrate the anniversary of Buddha's birth, usually in a highly formal, ritualized manner. They treat Buddha's statue as if it was Buddha himself, as if he were alive; bathing, and &quot;feeding&quot; him.&lt;ref&gt;Sarah J. Horton (2007) ''Living Buddhist statues in early medieval and modern Japan'', Palgrave Macmillan ISBN 1403964203 p. 24&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sikhism===
Sikhs celebrate the anniversary of the birth of [[Guru Nanak's Birthday|Guru Nanak]].

===North Korea===
In [[North Korea]], people do not celebrate birthdays on July 8 and December 17 because these were the dates of the deaths of [[Kim Il-sung]] and [[Kim Jong-il]], respectively. More than 100,000 North Koreans celebrate displaced birthdays on July 9 or December 18 to avoid these dates. A person born on July 8 before 1994 may change their birthday, with official recognition.&lt;ref&gt;Ju Seongha (2011-12-30) [http://news.donga.com/3/all/20111230/42964030/1 北 김정은 시대 北  12월 17일生 사라진다.] news.donga.com&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Assyrianfolkdance.jpg|thumb|230px|right|An [[Assyrian people|Assyrian]] dance party where participants engage in [[Assyrian folk dance|folk dancing]], [[Chicago]], USA.]]
A '''dance party''' (also referred to as a '''dance''') is a social gathering where [[dancing]] is the primary activity. Some dance parties are held in a casual setting and open to the public, such as a [[rave]], or those held in [[nightclub]]s and [[discothèque]]s. 

Other types of dance parties may be a formal or semi-formal private event which often require guests to don [[formal wear]] and have an invitation or membership within the community hosting the event, such as [[Dance party#School dances|school dance]]s and [[Cotillion ball|cotillions]]. 

Guests of formal dances often attend in pairs, as consorts or &quot;dates&quot; for one another. The term &quot;stag&quot; refers to going without a consort to a dance organized for couples.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=go stag - Idioms|url=http://idioms.thefreedictionary.com/go+stag|work=The Free Dictionary|publisher=Farlex|accessdate=30 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dances commonly take place during the evening, although some are held earlier during the daytime; such events are known as [[tea dance]]s.

==Casual dances==
Casual dances are dances that do not have a formal dress requirement; these may include school and community events, raves, evening entertainments provided for guests aboard a [[cruise ship]], and events organized for certain holidays, such as [[Halloween]] and [[Mardis Gras]].

==School dances==
{{Redirect|School Dance|the 2014 film|School Dance (film)}}
{{Further|:Category:School dances}}
A school dance is a dance sponsored by a school, and may be [[Casual wear|casual]] or [[Formal wear|formal]]. Casual school dances were originally limited to Western countries, although schools in other countries{{where?|date=September 2011}} are beginning to adopt such events.{{As of?|date=May 2012}} There are some schools, such as Arlington High School, that prohibit school-hosted dances, citing sex and alcohol problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/11/30/arlington-high-school-ban_n_1121038.html | work=Huffington Post | first=Carolyn | last=Gregoire | title=Should Schools Ban Dances Because Of Grinding? | date=2011-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In the United States===
{{main|Prom}}
One of the most significant school dances is [[prom]], a relatively formal event normally reserved for [[Junior (education)#High school|Junior]] grade and [[Senior (education)#High school|Senior]] grade students. Some schools host a [[winter formal]], a similar event, for the lower grades. In the 1950s, informal school dances in the United States were often called [[sock hop]]s. The traditional [[Sadie Hawkins dance]] may be formal or semi-formal.

==Formal dances==
{{main|Ball (dance)}}
[[File:Vienna Ball in Moscow.jpg|thumb|Vienna Ball in [[Moscow]], Russia]]
One type of formal dance, known as a ball, is a dance event where guests [[formal wear|dress formally]]. In Western culture, a male may don [[white tie]] and a female may don a [[ball gown]]. Dinner dances are formal dances where dinner is served. Often, the style of music played at a ball is most suited to [[ballroom dancing]].

==Popularity==
{{globalize|section|date=September 2011}}
In Australia, dance parties are popular amongst [[teenagers]], to the point that many dance parties are held specifically for teenagers in [[nightclub]]s or other locations which allow [[underage]] guests, who are usually unable to attend such places due to [[local law]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.consumer.vic.gov.au/CA256EB5000644CE/page/Listing-Liquor-Minors+on+licensed+premises?OpenDocument&amp;1=75-Liquor~&amp;2=0-Liquor~&amp;3=~|last=Lygopoulos|first=Anna|title=Minors on licensed premises|publisher=[[Consumer Affairs Victoria]]|date=2007-10-19|accessdate=2009-01-18 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080723154235/http://www.consumer.vic.gov.au/CA256EB5000644CE/page/Listing-Liquor-Minors+on+licensed+premises?OpenDocument&amp;1=75-Liquor~&amp;2=0-Liquor~&amp;3=~ &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2008-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Sensation White 08.03.2008 015.jpg|thumb|right|250px|A rave held in a warehouse-sized venue, with elaborate lighting and powerful sound system.]]
Dance parties are usually held at night, and may be hosted in private homes, [[Bar (establishment)|bars]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.minus18.org.au/joomla/index.php?option=com_magazine&amp;func=show_article&amp;id=45|title=September dance party|date=2008-08-04|publisher=minus18.org.au|accessdate=2009-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[gymnasiums]], nightclubs, [[community center]]s, [[ballroom]]s, or other large open spaces suitable for use as a [[Performance surface|dance floor]] by many people simultaneously.

The music at dance parties is usually played through a [[public address|PA system]] or a more powerful [[Sound reinforcement system|sound system]], and is often supplied by a [[DJ]] who selects and plays pre-[[Sound recording and reproduction|recorded]] songs from [[vinyl record]]s, [[compact disc]]s or with a [[laptop]]; however, some dance parties feature live instrumentalists or musicians playing their music live on an instrument, or with a laptop. Raves and other large,{{quantify|date=September 2011}} modern dance parties use [[visual effects|visual]] and [[lighting|lighting effect]]s, such as [[strobe light]]ing and [[fog machine|smoke machines]].{{clear}}

==Cultural milestones==
In the Jewish community, [[Bar and Bat Mitzvah]] celebrations often involve dances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.deseretnews.com/article/705305033/Teen-party-disasters.html|title=Tips for avoiding teen party disasters|date=May 18, 2009|work=Deseret News|accessdate=16 November 2010|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dances are common for [[Quinceañera]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.latinamericanstudies.org/quince-1.htm|title=Quinceañera Festivity|last=de la Cova|first=Tony|date=November 30, 2008|accessdate=16 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[sweet sixteen (birthday)|sweet sixteen]] parties and [[débutante]] celebrations. Some of these [[coming of age]] events involve a [[father-daughter dance]].

At [[wedding reception]]s, the [[newlywed]] couple may opt to have a [[first dance]] (before all guests are invited to participate on the dance floor).

A dance party that is gaining popularity is the [[Bollywood]] dance party, featuring music from [[Hindi]] cinema from [[India]]. A popular dance party that demonstrates this style of music and dance combination is produced by Wicked Karma &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wicked-karma.com|title=Wicked Karma|last=Christie|first=Lo|date=June 1, 2013|accessdate=10 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; that is produced by Christie Lo and DJ RDX &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.djrdxseattle.com|title=DJ RDX|last=Batra|first=Rohit|date=June 1, 2013|accessdate=10 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Specialized events==
Some dance events may put an emphasis on certain genres of dance. For example, an event may feature [[swing dance|swing]] or [[square dance|square dancing]] rather than dancing in general.  A [[masked ball]] is a type of [[costume party]] that features dancing. Dance parties at which people mainly dance [[Tango (dance)|Tango]] are called [[Milonga (place)|Milongas]].

===Pre-1930===
Sportswear originally described clothing made specifically for sport. One of the first couturiers to specialise in this was the British [[Redfern (couture)|John Redfern]] who in the 1870s began designing tailored garments for increasingly active women who [[equestrianism|rode]], played [[tennis]], went [[yachting]], and did [[archery]]. Redfern's clothes, although intended for specific sporting pursuits, were adopted as everyday wear by his clients, making him probably the first sportswear designer.&lt;ref&gt;[http://collections.vam.ac.uk/objectid/O154069 Redfern suit, circa 1911] in the collections database of the Victoria &amp; Albert Museum, London&lt;/ref&gt; Also in the late nineteenth century, garments associated with sportswear and/or modified from menswear, such as the [[shirt]]waist began to form part of the working woman's wardrobe.&lt;ref name=arnoldorigin&gt;{{cite book |last1=Arnold |first1=Rebecca |title=The American look : fashion, sportswear and the image of women in 1930s and 1940s New York |date=2008 |publisher=I.

While 1920s Paris designers such as [[Coco Chanel]] and [[Jean Patou]] offered [[haute couture]] designs that could be considered sportswear, it was typically not their design focus. A notable exception was the tennis player [[Jane Régny]] (the pseudonym of Madame Balouzet Tillard de Tigny), who opened a couture house specialising in clothing for sport and travel.&lt;ref name=arnoldorigin/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Staff writer |title=The Dressmakers of France |url=http://www.gbacg.org/costume-resources/original/articles/dressmakers.pdf |accessdate=19 November 2015 |work=Fortune |publisher=Time, Inc |date=August 1932}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=stewart/&gt; Another famous tennis player, [[Suzanne Lenglen]], was director of the sportswear department at Patou.&lt;ref name=stewart/&gt; In contrast to the flexibility of American sportswear, these expensive couture garments were typically prescribed for very specific circumstances.&lt;ref name=rm/&gt;&lt;ref name=stewart/&gt; Many couturiers began designing clothing that, whilst suitable for sport, could be worn in a wider range of contexts.&lt;ref name=stewart/&gt; Chanel, who promoted her own active, financially independent lifestyle through relaxed jersey suits and uncluttered dresses, became famous for clothes of &quot;the sports type.&quot;&lt;ref name=arnoldorigin/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Krick, Jessa. &quot;Gabrielle &quot;Coco&quot; Chanel (1883–1971) and the House of Chanel&quot;. In Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History. New York: The Metropolitan Museum of Art, 2000–. http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/chnl/hd_chnl.htm (October 2004)&lt;/ref&gt; In 1926 ''[[Harper's Bazaar]]'' reported upon Chanel's sporty garments, noting the absence of equivalent apparel from New York fashion presentations.&lt;ref name=arnoldorigin/&gt;

As more generic, versatile sportswear became more prominent in the Paris collections, the press increasingly promoted the wearing of such garments in an everyday context.&lt;ref name=stewart/&gt; By the mid-1920s, American advertisers also began actively pushing the idea that sporty clothing was just as appropriate for regular daywear as it was for active pursuits, presenting it as the epitome of modernity and the American ideal.&lt;ref name=arnoldorigin/&gt; One advertisement put out by [[Abercrombie &amp; Fitch]] in ''Vogue'' in 1929 suggested that while men might admire a girl in an glamorous evening gown, they would be less intimidated by her approachable, friendly appearance in good-quality sportswear.&lt;ref name=arnoldorigin/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Advertisement |title=Advertisement caption for Abercrombie and Fitch |journal=Vogue |date=16 March 1929 |page=15}} Cited by Arnold, p.24&lt;/ref&gt; Sportswear was also presented as an accessible version of [[resort wear]], a term for the luxurious travelling clothing and holiday wear worn by those who could afford a leisurely lifestyle with multiple vacations, such as cruises, yachting, and [[skiing]].&lt;ref name=arnoldorigin/&gt; Affordable, well-designed all-American sportswear was presented as a way of enabling a less wealthy customer to feel part of that same lifestyle.&lt;ref name=arnoldorigin/&gt; Although the influence of Europe, particularly Parisian high fashion and English tailoring, was always significant, the [[Great Depression]] which started in 1929 acted as a trigger to encourage American fashion to focus on homegrown style and design - particularly sportswear.&lt;ref name=arnoldorigin/&gt; Despite the acceptance of fashionable sportswear as a form of casual dressing in French fashion in the 1920s, the American garment industry went on to become the most prominent producers of such clothing.&lt;ref name=stewart/&gt; The key difference between French and American sportswear was that French sportswear was usually a small part of a high-end designer's output, while the American sportswear designers focused on affordable, versatile, easy-care garments that could be mass-produced and were relevant to the customer's lifestyle.&lt;ref name=rm/&gt;

===1930–1970===
The precursors of true sportswear emerged in New York before the Second World War.&lt;ref name=nyf/&gt; 1930s designers such as [[Clare Potter]] and [[Claire McCardell]] were among the first American designers to gain name recognition through their innovative clothing designs, which [[Richard Martin (curator)|Richard Martin]] described as demonstrating &quot;problem-solving ingenuity and realistic lifestyle applications&quot;.&lt;ref name=rm/&gt; Garments were designed to be easy-to-wear and comfortable, using practical fabrics such as [[denim]], cotton, and [[jersey (fabric)|jersey]]. McCardell in particular has been described as America's greatest sportswear designer.&lt;ref name=vs&gt;{{cite book| last = Steele| first = Valerie| title = Fifty Years of Fashion: New Look To Now | publisher = Yale University Press, New Haven &amp; London| year = 1997| pages =27| ISBN = 0-300-07132-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her simple, practical clothes suited the relaxed American dress code, neither formal nor informal, that became established during the 1930s and 1940s.&lt;ref name=nyf/&gt; One of McCardell's key designs was the [[Popover dress]], which was versatile enough to work in multiple contexts from swimsuit cover-up to party dress.&lt;ref&gt;Claire McCardell: [http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/works-of-art/C.I.45.71.2ab &quot;Popover&quot; dress (C.I.45.71.2ab)] | Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History&quot; The Metropolitan Museum of Art. Web. 14 Nov 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Other McCardell signatures included [[ballet slippers]] as everyday footwear and functional pockets in skirts and trousers.&lt;ref name=feal&gt;{{cite web |last1=Unknown |title=American Look |url=http://www.fashionencyclopedia.com/fashion_costume_culture/Modern-World-1946-1960/American-Look.html |website=Fashion Encyclopaedia |publisher=Advameg Inc. |accessdate=17 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; McCardell once proclaimed: &quot;I belong to a mass production country where any of us, all of us, deserve the right to good fashion.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Batterberry, Michael, and Ariane Batterberry. Fashion: The Mirror of History. New York: Greenwich House, 1977&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Batterberry |first1=Michael |last2=Batterberry |first2=Ariane |title=Fashion, the mirror of history |date=1982 |publisher=Greenwich House |location=New York |isbn=9780517388815 |edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other sportswear designs often used elements of sporty informal or casual wear such as Clare Potter's innovative evening sweater and evening skirt draped like a [[sidesaddle]] riding habit.&lt;ref name=ny&gt;Schiro, Anne-Marie, ''[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=980CEFDF1731F932A25752C0A96F958260 &quot;Clare Potter, Who Set Trends In Women's Clothes, Dies at 95&quot;] ''[[New York Times]]'', January 11, 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of the first sportswear designers were women. A common argument was that female designers projected their personal values into this new style.&lt;ref name=rm/&gt; In the 1930s and 40s, it was rare for clothing to be justified through its practicality. It was traditionally thought that Paris fashion exemplified beauty, and therefore, sportswear required different criteria for assessment.&lt;ref name=rm/&gt; The designer's personal life was therefore linked to their sportswear designs. Another selling point was sportswear's popularity with consumers, with [[department store]] representatives such as [[Dorothy Shaver]] of [[Lord &amp; Taylor]] using sales figures to back up their claims.&lt;ref name=rm/&gt; Martin credits the 1930s and 40s sportswear designers with freeing American fashion from the need to copy Paris couture. Where Paris fashion was traditionally imposed onto the customer regardless of her wishes, American sportswear was democratic, widely available, and encouraged self-expression.&lt;ref name=rm/&gt; The early sportswear designers proved that the creation of original ready-to-wear fashion could be a legitimate design art which responded stylishly to utilitarian requirements.&lt;ref name=rm/&gt; One of the few male sportswear designers at this time was [[Tom Brigance]], who by the late 1930s was regularly ranked alongside Clare Potter as a leading name in mid-range priced sportswear.&lt;ref name=arnoldbrig&gt;{{cite book |last1=Arnold |first1=Rebecca |title=The American look : fashion, sportswear, and the image of women in 1930s and 1940s New York |date=2008 |publisher=I. B. Tauris |location=London |isbn=9781860647635 |pages=9, 107, 120-122}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like Potter, Brigance understood how to design smart and fashionable clothing for mass-production, which made his clothes attractive to manufacturers as well as to customers.&lt;ref name=arnoldbrig/&gt;

After the Second World War, the emergence in Paris of the luxurious &quot;New Look&quot; popularised by [[Christian Dior]], with its emphasis on accessorising and femininity, was in direct contrast to the relaxed, easy-wear American look.&lt;ref name=feal/&gt; Unlike traditional made-to-measure French couture fashion, designed for specific silhouettes, American sportswear was designed to accommodate a variety of body shapes and enable freedom of movement.&lt;ref name=feal/&gt; Authors such as Rebecca Arnold and Emily S. Rosenberg noted that the American look, demonstrated through healthy teeth and the use of affordable, good-quality fashionable clothing to present a neat and practical appearance, despite claims of [[egalitarianism]], was ultimately held up against [[Definitions of whiteness in the United States|white standards]] of beauty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Arnold |first1=Rebecca |title=The American look : fashion, sportswear, and the image of women in 1930s and 1940s New York |date=2008 |publisher=I.

===1970–2000===
In the 1970s [[Geoffrey Beene]], one of the first significant male sportswear designers, incorporated elements of menswear into his relaxed women's clothing. His fondness for layering garments and menswear elements are widely used by early 21st century industry designers.&lt;ref name=nyf/&gt; In 1970, [[Bill Blass (designer)|Bill Blass]], whose fashion career began in 1946, founded his own company, Bill Blass Limited.&lt;ref name=blass&gt;[http://www.biography.com/people/bill-blass-9215129 Biography of Bill Blass (from the ''Encyclopædia Britannica'')]. Accessed 16 March 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Blass's wearable designs were designed to be worn day and night and he was said to have raised American sportswear to the highest possible level.&lt;ref name=nemy&gt;[http://www.nytimes.com/2002/06/13/obituaries/13BLAS.html Bill Blass, Whose Clothes Gave Casual an Elegant Air, Dies at 79]. Published 13 June 2002. Accessed 16 March 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Like Beene, he introduced menswear touches to his sportswear, which was described as clean, modern and impeccable in style.&lt;ref name=nemy/&gt; In 1976, the designer [[Zoran (designer)|Zoran]] brought out the first of a number of collections of extremely simple garments made of the finest quality fabrics; garments that barely changed over the years and which became cult objects to his wealthy clientele.&lt;ref name=menkes&gt;{{cite news |last1=Menkes |first1=Suzy |title=Simply Modern:Contrasting Looks at Luxury for the 1990s |url=http://www.nytimes.com/1993/09/28/style/28iht-zoran.html |accessdate=2 March 2015 |work=The New York Times |date=28 September 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1993, the fashion journalist [[Suzy Menkes]] declared Zoran's less-is-more sportswear prophetic of the early 1990s modernist trend.&lt;ref name=menkes/&gt;

[[Marc Jacobs]], who set up his eponymous label in 1986, is renowned for layered informality in both day and evening wear.&lt;ref name=nyf/&gt; Late 20th century sportswear designers with the highest profile include the industry empires of [[Ralph Lauren]], [[Calvin Klein]], [[Donna Karan]], and [[Tommy Hilfiger]], each of whom created distinctive wardrobes for the American woman based upon stylish but wearable, comfortable and interchangeable multi-purpose clothes that combined practicability with luxury.&lt;ref name=nyf/&gt; In 1993, Zoran, who had always worked along these principles, praised the work of Klein, Karan, and the work of the [[Anne Klein]] label as epitomising the &quot;comfort, simplicity, and practicality&quot; associated with sportswear.&lt;ref name=menkes/&gt; Most early 21st century sportswear design follows in the footsteps of these designers.&lt;ref name=nyf/&gt;

Alongside Jacobs and Zoran, other notable 1980s and 1990s sportswear designers include [[Isaac Mizrahi]], who presented his first collection in 1987.  The original Isaac Mizrahi label closed in 1998, and Mizrahi subsequently designed a womenswear [[diffusion collection]] for [[Target (department store)|Target]] from 2002 to 2008.&lt;ref name=nyf/&gt;

===21st century sportswear===
[[File:Michael Kors Spring-Summer 2014 01.jpg|thumb|upright|Relaxed easy-wear sportswear by [[Michael Kors]], Spring-Summer 2014.]]
In 2000, the ''Lifestyle Monitor'', an American [[trade magazine]] owned by [[Cotton Incorporated]] published that their surveys showed that an average of 64% of women interviewed preferred casual wear, including sportswear as distinct from [[sportswear (activewear)|active wear]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://lifestylemonitor.cottoninc.com/lsm-weekly/lsm-weekly-articles/?articleID=209&amp;prevArticle=387&amp;nextArticle=389 The Monitor Celebrates Sixty Years of Sportswear], Lifestyle Monitor, 23 March 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

Notable New York sportswear designers of the first decade of the 21st century included [[Zac Posen]], [[Proenza Schouler]], [[Mary Ping]], [[Derek Lam]], and [[Behnaz Sarafpour]], who were all featured in the Sportswear section of the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]]'s ''New York Fashion Now'' exhibition in 2007.&lt;ref name=nyf/&gt;

Designers who do not typically work in the sportswear tradition such as [[Monique Lhuillier]] sometimes incorporate elements of sportswear and activewear into their work. Lhuillier, mainly known for formal gowns, introduced sporty necklines and aerodynamic elements into her collection for [[New York Fashion Week]], Fall 2011.&lt;ref name=boston&gt;Critchell, Samantha.

Accessed 16 March 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012 [[Tim Gunn]] noted that the boundaries between activewear and fashion sportswear had become increasingly blurred since the 1980s, with many people choosing to wear [[hoodie]]s, [[tracksuit]]s, [[yoga pants]], and other garments explicitly associated with athletic wear as everyday dress.&lt;ref name=gunn&gt;{{cite book |last1=Gunn |first1=Tim |last2=Calhoun |first2=Ada |title=Tim Gunn's fashion bible : the fascinating history of everything in your closet |date=2012 |publisher=Gallery Books|location=New York |isbn=9781451643862 |pages=205–212 |edition=1st Gallery Books hardcover|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=pWG9AAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA205 |chapter=Athletic Wear: Attack of the Playclothes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Outside the United States==

===Italy===
In the late 1940s and 1950s non-American designers began to pay attention to sportswear, and attempted to produce collections following its principle. French couturiers such as [[Christian Dior SA|Dior]] and [[Jacques Fath]] simplified their designs for ready-to-wear production, but at first only the Italian designers understood the sportswear principle.&lt;ref name=dc&gt;da Cruz, Elyssa. [http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/itfa/hd_itfa.htm  &quot;Made in Italy: Italian Fashion from 1950 to Now&quot;]. In Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History. New York: The Metropolitan Museum of Art, 2000–. http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/itfa/hd_itfa.htm (October 2004)&lt;/ref&gt; Italy already had a reputation for fine fabrics and excellent workmanship, and the emergence of high quality Italian ready-to-wear that combined this luxury with the casual quality of American sportswear ensured the worldwide success of Italian fashion by the mid-1970s.&lt;ref name=vs2/&gt; Designers such as [[Emilio Pucci]] and [[Simonetta Visconti]] grasped that there was a market for clothing that combined sophistication and comfort.&lt;ref name=dc/&gt; This was a challenge to the American industry. [[John Fairchild (editor)|John Fairchild]], the outspoken publisher of ''[[Women's Wear Daily]]'' opined:

::&quot;The Italians were the first to make refined sportswear. [...] Americans don't mind spending if the sweater is by [[Krizia]] or [[Missoni]].&quot;&lt;ref name=vs2&gt;{{cite book| last = Steele| first = Valerie| title = Fifty Years of Fashion: New Look To Now | publisher = Yale University Press, New Haven &amp; London| year = 1997| pages =104–105| ISBN = 0-300-07132-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before co-founding the business that later became Missoni with his bride Rosita in 1953, [[Ottavio Missoni]], himself an athlete, and his team-mate [[Giorgio Oberweger]] had an activewear business in [[Trieste]] making wool [[tracksuit]]s christened Venjulia suits.&lt;ref name=sportsref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ottavio Missoni Bio, Stats and Results|url=http://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/athletes/mi/ottavio-missoni-1.html|publisher=Sports Reference|accessdate=11 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The success of the Venjulia suits, which took into account the need of athletes for functional, warm garments enabling freedom of movement, led to their being worn by the [[1948 Summer Olympics|1948 Italian Olympics team]] (which included Missoni himself).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Missonologia : the world of Missoni |year=1995 |publisher=Electa |location=Milan |isbn=0789200481 |page=19 |url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?ei=cyaOUYiOCKbI0QX7vYHQDA&amp;id=bm1OAAAAYAAJ&amp;dq=Venjulia|edition=1st U.S.|author=Steve Piccolo (translator)|editor=Isa Tutino Vercelloni}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1960s Missoni became renowned for their uniquely colored, mix-and-match knitwear separates based upon activewear,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Black|first=Sandy|title=Fashioning fabrics: contemporary textiles in fashion|year=2006|publisher=Black Dog|location=London|page=176|isbn=1904772412}}&lt;/ref&gt; which have remained desirable and fashionable well into the 21st century.&lt;ref name=indobit&gt;{{cite news|last=Watson|first=Linda|title=Ottavio Missoni: Fashion designer who transformed the world of luxury knitwear|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/ottavio-missoni-fashion-designer-who-transformed-the-world-of-luxury-knitwear-8611726.html|accessdate=11 May 2013|newspaper=The Independent|date=10 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The quality of Italian sportswear was recognized early on by Robert Goldworm, an American sportswear designer who in 1947 joined his New York-based family company [[Goldworm]].&lt;ref name=barbara&gt;{{cite book |last=Perso Heinemann |first=Barbara |title=Fashioning an Artful Life: One Woman's Life History in Clothes |date=2008 |publisher=University of Minnesota |isbn=9780549405054 |pages=107–108 |url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=oSqL94evfOsC&amp;pg=PA107#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through his second company base in Milan, Goldworm became the first American knitwear designer to take advantage of Italian quality and bring it to the New York market.&lt;ref name=barbara/&gt; In 1959 Goldworm, in recognition of his active promotion and support of the Italian knitwear industry, was made a Commander of the [[Order of the Star of Italian Solidarity]] by the Italian government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lambert|first=Eleanor|title=World of fashion : people, places, resources|date=1976|publisher=R.R.

In the 21st century, Italian fashion remains a leading source for sportswear design outside the United States. [[Narciso Rodriguez]], who is known for streamlined and pared down clothing, launched in [[Milan]] in 1997, but moved to New York in 2001.&lt;ref name=nyf/&gt; [[Miuccia Prada]] revived the fortunes of her family company [[Prada]] with her top-quality sportswear designs in the 1990s, and continues designing for the firm.&lt;ref name=dc/&gt;

===United Kingdom===
Successful British sportswear designers include [[Stella McCartney]], known for her jumpsuits and easy-to-wear separates. McCartney was asked to design the athletic uniforms for the [[2012 Summer Olympics]], bringing fashionable sportswear design to the world of high-profile activewear.&lt;ref&gt;Chetty, Derick.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Capsule wardrobe''' is a term coined by Susie Faux, the owner of a [[London]] [[boutique]] called &quot;Wardrobe&quot; in the 1970s. According to Faux, a '''capsule wardrobe''' is a collection of a few essential items of clothing that don't go out of [[fashion]], such as [[skirt]]s, trousers, and coats, which can then be augmented with seasonal pieces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Susie|first=Faux|title=Capsule Wardrobe|url=http://confidencetricks.susiefaux.com/?cat=48|accessdate=6 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; This idea was popularised by American designer [[Donna Karan]], who, in 1985, released an influential capsule collection of seven interchangeable work-wear pieces.&lt;ref name=&quot;donnakaran&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Donna Karen|url=http://www.vogue.com/voguepedia/Donna_Karan_%28Brand%29|work=voguepedia|publisher=Vogue|accessdate=6 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The term is widely used in the British and American fashion media, and has been the subject of several popular television series. The term has come to refer to a collection of clothing that is composed of interchangeable items only, to maximise the number of outfits that can be created. The aim is to have an outfit suitable for any occasion without owning excessive items of clothing. This is usually achieved by buying what are considered to be &quot;key&quot; or &quot;staple&quot; items in coordinating colours.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=mycapsulewardrobe.com|url=http://www.mycapsulewardrobe.com/index.htm|accessdate=7 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term &quot;capsule wardrobe&quot; was coined by Susie Faux,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The perfect capsule wardrobe|url=http://uktv.co.uk/really/item/aid/2676|publisher=UKTV|accessdate=8 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;About Susie Faux&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Faux|first=Susie|title=About Susie Faux|url=http://confidencetricks.susiefaux.com/?page_id=17|accessdate=6 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; owner of the West End boutique &quot;Wardrobe&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;About Wardrobe&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Susie|first=Faux|title=About Wardrobe|url=http://www.wardrobe.co.uk/welcome.html|accessdate=6 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the 1970s to refer to a collection of essential items of clothing that would not go out of fashion, and therefore could be worn for multiple seasons. The aim was to update this collection with seasonal pieces to provide something to wear for any occasion without buying many new items of clothing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Susie|first=Faux|title=Capsule Wardrobe|url=http://confidencetricks.susiefaux.com/?cat=48|accessdate=6 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Typically, Faux suggests that a woman's capsule wardrobe contain at least &quot;2 pairs of trousers, a dress or a skirt, a jacket, a coat, a knit, two pairs of shoes and two bags&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Zoe|last=Clarke|title=Capsule Wardrobe|url=http://lifeofavegetariangirl.blogspot.co.uk/2012/02/capsule-wardrobe.html|accessdate=6 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of a capsule wardrobe was popularised by American designer [[Donna Karan]] in 1985, when she released her &quot;7 Easy Pieces&quot; collection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Krebs|first=Jost|title=Donna Karen Biography|url=http://www.infomat.com/whoswho/donnakaran.html|accessdate=6 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;donnakaran&quot; /&gt; Her aim was to fill what she referred to as &quot;a void in the marketplace&quot; for a stylish and practical wardrobe designed with working women in mind.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Karan|first=Donna|title=Fortune Turn for a Fast-Rising Fashion Star|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1994/06/20/us/fortunes-turn-for-a-fast-rising-fashion-star.html|publisher=New York Times|accessdate=6 April 2012|date=20 June 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the collection debuted, she showed eight [[Model (profession)|model]]s dressed only in [[bodysuit]]s and black [[tights]]. The models then began to add items of clothing such as wrap-skirts, trousers, and dresses,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hyde|first=Nina|title=Donna Karan show report|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=OWMaAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=ZyoEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2671,689945&amp;dq=donna+karan&amp;hl=en|accessdate=6 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; to demonstrate her interchangeable style of dressing.

As a term, &quot;capsule wardrobe&quot; is widely used in the fashion media; for instance, the fashion sections in British newspapers ''[[The Independent]]'' and ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' have recently run dedicated capsule wardrobe features,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Walker|first=Harriet|title=The Capsule Wardrobe|url=http://fashion.telegraph.co.uk/news-features/TMG4401266/How-to-build-a-capsule-wardrobe.html|publisher=The Independent|accessdate=7 April 2012|location=London|date=1 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Trotter|first=Louise|title=How To Build A Capsule Wardrobe|url=http://fashion.telegraph.co.uk/news-features/TMG4401266/How-to-build-a-capsule-wardrobe.html|accessdate=7 April 2012|location=London|work=The Daily Telegraph|date=1 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as British ''[[Marie Claire]]'' and ''[[Elle (magazine)|Elle]]'' magazines, among others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Capsule Wardrobe Staples|url=http://www.marieclaire.co.uk/fashion/best/34806/10/capsule-wardrobe-staples.html#index=9&amp;slider=off|publisher=Marie Claire|accessdate=7 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Weir|first=Laura|title=Romantic Getaway|url=http://www.elleuk.com/style/occasions/romantic-getaway|publisher=Elle UK|accessdate=7 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept has been further popularised by several television programmes, including ''Trinny and Susannah's 'What Not to Wear''', which aired on the BBC 2001–2007, and ''Gok's Fashion Fix'', which aired on Channel Four from 2008 onwards. Presenter and stylist Gok Wan asserts that a capsule wardrobe is an especially important tool in a recession as it allows people to look good on a small budget.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wan|first=Gok|title=Gok's Fashion Fix|url=http://www.channel4.com/programmes/goks-fashion-fix|accessdate=8 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is perhaps part of the reason that the idea has endured since its conception in the 1970s.

== General rules ==
Below are rules widely given for creating a capsule wardrobe:

* Choose a colour scheme.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=mcw colour scheme advice|url=http://www.mycapsulewardrobe.com/index.htm|publisher=mycapsulewardrobe.com|accessdate=8 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Trotter|first=Louise|title=How to build a capsule wardrobe|url=http://fashion.telegraph.co.uk/news-features/TMG4401266/How-to-build-a-capsule-wardrobe.html|publisher=The Telegraph|accessdate=8 April 2012|location=London|date=1 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; This would typically involve choosing one or two base colours that go with everything, such as black, white, brown, grey, or navy. Items such as trousers, handbags or coats would be bought in shades of these colours, so that they can be put with anything else in the wardrobe. After choosing the base colours, choose one or two accent colours, which are brighter than the base colours, and co-ordinate with each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Franca|last=Eirich|title=How to build a capsule wardrobe around three colours|url=http://www.oranges-and-apples.com/2009/11/how-to-build-capsule-wardrobe-around.html|accessdate=8 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; These would typically be used for items such as tops, dresses, or accessories; once a colour scheme is established, all the items in a wardrobe should be interchangeable, as the colour of the pieces always complement each other.
* Consider your body shape.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Vears|first=Amy|title=The perfect capsule wardrobe: Evaluate|url=http://www.opentalkmagazine.com/fashion-style/womens_style-tips/3166-how-to-build-the-perfect-capsule-wardrobe.html|publisher=opentalkmagazine.com|accessdate=8 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Galpin|first=Jane|title=Dresses by Body Shape|url=http://www.channel4.com/4beauty/style/dress-for-your-body-shape/dresses-by-body-shape|publisher=Channel 4|accessdate=8 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some cuts of clothing are more flattering than others; for instance, stylists often advise that women with wider hips wear cap sleeves, as they make the shoulders appear wider, and more proportionate to the hips. If the items of clothing chosen are flattering, the wearer is more likely to want to keep them in their wardrobe.
* Consider your complexion. As with cuts of clothing, some colours are more flattering than others, to both skin tone and body shape. If the colours are well-chosen, then the items are more likely to remain in favour.
* Choose classic shapes and patterns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Walker|first=Harriet|title=The capsule wardrobe: Fashion changes, these endure|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/fashion/features/the-capsule-wardrobe-fashion-changes-these-endure-7606555.html|publisher=The Independent|accessdate=8 April 2012|location=London|date=2 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Trotter|first=Louise|title=How to build a capsule wardrobe|url=http://fashion.telegraph.co.uk/news-features/TMG4401266/How-to-build-a-capsule-wardrobe.html|accessdate=8 April 2012|location=London|work=The Daily Telegraph|date=1 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  While some cuts and patterns of clothing go in and out of fashion, others are considered 'classic' because they do not date. It is wise to choose classic pieces for a capsule wardrobe, as the wearer intends to keep them for a number of years.
* Choose high-quality fabrics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Jane|title=Barneys: How to create a capsule wardrobe|url=http://www.barneysmcr.com/blog/how-to-create-a-capsule-wardrobe/|publisher=Barneys|accessdate=8 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As the idea of a capsule wardrobe is to own a few items of clothing that can be worn different ways, individual pieces get lots of wear. Therefore, it is a good idea to choose clothing that is well made and continues to look good despite wear.

'''&quot;Summer Wear&quot;''' is a [[science fiction]] [[short story]] written by [[L. Sprague de Camp]], a story in his ''[[Viagens Interplanetarias]]'' series. It is the first (chronologically) set on the planet Osiris. It was first published in the magazine ''[[Startling Stories]]'' in the issue for May, 1950. It first appeared in book form in the anthology '''''[[The Best Science Fiction Stories: 1951]]''''', edited by [[Everett F. Bleiler]] and [[T. E. Dikty]], published in hardcover by [[Frederick Fell]] in 1951, and was gathered together with other ''Viagens'' stories in the collection '''''[[The Continent Makers and Other Tales of the Viagens]]''''', published in hardcover by [[Twayne Publishers]] in 1953, and in paperback by [[Signet Books]] in 1971. The story has been translated into [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], [[Dutch language|Dutch]], [[Italian language|Italian]] and [[German language|German]].&lt;ref name=&quot;laughlin2462474445&quot;&gt;Laughlin, Charlotte, and Levack, Daniel J. H. ''De Camp: An L. Sprague de Camp Bibliography''. San Francisco, Underwood/Miller, 1983, pages 246-247, 44-45&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot summary==
Terrans '''Cato Chapman''' and '''Celia Zorn''', respectively a salesman and model affiliated with the fashionable summer wear firm '''Greenfarb's of Hollywood''', embark on the ''Viagens'' starship '''''Camões''''', bound for the planet '''Osiris'''. They hope to create a market for Greenfarb's styles among the reptilian '''Osirians''', who natively wear nothing but body paint. They quickly discover they have rivals on board; '''Jean-Jaques Bergerat''' and '''Anya Savinkov''', representing '''Tomaselli's of Paris'''. Amid interesting interplay with the other passengers, including both Terrans and alien Osirians and '''Thothians''', the voyage becomes a double exercise in industrial espionage as Chapman and Bergerat each attempt to sabotage the other. Bergerat succeeds in spoiling Chapman's samples, but is caught and incarcerated due to Chapman's machinations; the latter thereupon appropriates Bergerat's own samples as replacements. On Osiris, Chapman, Celia and Anya hold a fashion show, their products become wildly popular with the Osirians, and they secure a contract for Greenfarb's. Chapman and Bergerat end their dispute on the return voyage and each becomes involved with (and marries) his former rival's business partner. As the interstellar voyage between the Solar System and the Procyon system harboring Osiris takes five months subjective time (and over ten years objective time) each way, there is ample opportunity for such bonds to form. But a surprise awaits them; back on Earth, Osirian body paint has become the rage during their nearly two dozen years' absence, and both Greenfarb's and Tomaselli's have gone out of business!

The action of &quot;Summer Wear&quot; takes place in the years 2104-2128 AD.

==Setting==
The planet Osiris is an arid world whose dinosauroid inhabitants are characterized as both sentimental and rapaciously capitalistic; they are also possessed of mind-controlling powers, generally referred to as &quot;telepathic pseudohypnosis,&quot; against which other intelligent species must take special precautions. Osiris occupies the same star system as Thoth, a wet planet whose natives are amoral and anarchic.

'''Low-rise''' is a style of clothing designed to sit low on, or below, the [[hips]]. The style can also be called '''lowcut''', '''hipster''', or '''[[hip-hugger]]'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=aZ-BAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=Low+rise+fashion&amp;q=Hipsters#search_anchor |title=Fashion in costume, 1200–1980 |author=Nunn, Joan |publisher=Herbert Press |year=1984 |accessdate=11 August 2011|isbn=9780906969373}}&lt;/ref&gt; and can apply to garments worn by males or females. The term can be applied to all garments that cover the wearer's [[crotch]] area, including trousers, jeans, [[shorts]], [[skirts]], [[panties]], [[briefs]], [[bikinis]], [[pantyhose]], and [[tights]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=MvilOZhaRkAC&amp;dq=Low+rise+fashion |title=As Seen in Vogue: A Century of American Fashion in Advertising |author=Hill, Daniel Delis |publisher=Texas Tech University Press |date=1 September 2007 |accessdate=11 August 2011|isbn=9780896726161}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Terminology==
The &quot;rise&quot; of a bottom garment is measured by the distance between the crotch and the [[Waistline (clothing)|waistline]] or top of the garment and is usually around {{convert|12|in|cm}} on regular pants. The average rise of a low-rise garment is roughly {{convert|8|in|cm}} with some as little as {{convert|3|to|4|in|cm}}. A normal low-rise sits at least {{convert|2|to|3|in|cm|sigfig=1}} below the [[navel]]. A &quot;super&quot; or an &quot;ultra low-rise&quot; sits at {{convert|4|to|5|in|cm}} below the navel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=2HFOyFFv3wUC&amp;dq=Low+rise+fashion |title=Good Girls Don't Have to Dress Bad: A Style Guide for Every Woman |author=Braendel, Shari |publisher=Zondervan |year=2010 |isbn=0-310-32601-X |accessdate=11 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The low-rise fashion expanded in the early 1990s after the March 1993 issue of the British magazine ''[[The Face (magazine)|The Face]]'' which featured [[Kate Moss]] in [[low-rise jeans]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://books.google.co.in/books?id=ziUAAAAAMBAJ&amp;dq=New+York+Magazine%E2%80%8E+Navel&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s |title=Navel Mauvers |work=New York Magazine |date=10 May 1993 |page=26 |accessdate=11 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Clothing manufacturer [[Levi Strauss &amp; Co]]. introduced low-rise jeans in December 2000, the top of which were about {{convert|3|in|cm|frac=2|spell=in}} below the navel, with a zipper of a mere {{convert|3+1/4|in|cm}} long. Backs were also cut low, but not so low that they exposed backside cleavage.&lt;ref name=&quot;l&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=SUSAN PHINNEY|title=Navel maneuvers: Hip-huggers and short tops are hot this season|url=http://www.seattlepi.com/lifestyle/article/Navel-maneuvers-Hip-huggers-and-short-tops-are-1060310.php|publisher=Seattlepi|accessdate=15 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It later adopted the style in men's wear.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=kTYxAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=9f0DAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6794,8532147&amp;dq=low+rise+men&amp;hl=en Lakeland Ledger - Jul 29, 2002]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=bDkjAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=G4oFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2437,619073&amp;dq=low+rise+men&amp;hl=en The Sunday Gazette - Sep 3, 2002]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nytimes.com/2003/01/12/style/pulse-sling-low-swing-high.html PULSE - Sling Low, Swing High - The New York Times]&lt;/ref&gt; Gradually the wide acceptance of low-rise pants by men led to low-rise [[swimwear]] and briefs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=7sJQAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=SMcMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4508,4531008&amp;dq=low+rise+men&amp;hl=en The Southeast Missourian - Aug 4, 2002]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.co.in/books?id=ZnSBRxsjn_4C&amp;pg=PA98&amp;dq=low+rise+men+fashion&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=bwFvTtdBpu7SAcfnxKwK&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CE4Q6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=low%20rise%20&amp;f=false Boy culture - an encyclopedia, Volume 1 - Shirley R.

The trend became so popular that in 2002, a [[Barbie]] doll wearing low-rise jeans named &quot;My Scene&quot; Barbie was introduced in stores.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=A sexier,hippier Barbie hits shelves|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=xlkeAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=BcgEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1235,4052048&amp;dq=navel+expose&amp;hl=en|accessdate=15 March 2012|newspaper=Times Daily|date=Nov 28, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=HIP, NEW BARBIE HITS STORE SHELVES, JUST IN TIME FOR CHRISTMAS WISH LISTS|url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=DDNB&amp;p_theme=ddnb&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;p_topdoc=1&amp;p_text_direct-0=0F7A1D4E61F11C63&amp;p_field_direct-0=document_id&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;s_trackval=GooglePM|accessdate=15 March 2012|newspaper=Dayton Daily News|date=November 28, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Indian fashion==
The term is applied to [[sari]]s and [[Ghagra choli]]s in [[India]]. Due to migration to different countries,{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}} many Indian women began to wear the normal sari below the waistline exposing the navel which is known as Low-rise sari.&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.co.in/books?id=Y9ukaQcdV9oC&amp;dq=belly+button+sari&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s Aging and menopause among Indian South African women – Brian M. Du Toit].&lt;/ref&gt; These type of saris are worn such that the [[petticoat]] is tied at some inches below the navel and just above the pubic area. Similarly, the [[lehenga]]s of ghagra cholis are also worn in low-rise. Designer [[Manish Malhotra]]'s Fashion Week collections regularly highlight low waisted ghaghras accompanied by short cholis.&lt;ref&gt;[http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/bollywood-deepika-padukone-katrina-navel-look-is-new-cleavage-for-sexy-indian-women-and-re-emergence-of-sari/1/140273.html &quot;Rise of the Navel 'Bollywood navel fashion has led to re-emergence of sari'&quot;].

''[[The New York Times]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; This were made popular by the female celebrities of [[Bollywood]] industry and other popular regional film industries like [[Tamil cinema]] and [[Cinema of Andhra Pradesh|Telugu cinema]]. These are mainly worn by the rich, educated upper-class women who consider navel exposure as a fashion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.co.in/books?id=nXNqTlwhtl0C&amp;vq=Navel&amp;dq=fashion+expose+saree&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s Dress and gender: making and meaning in cultural contexts –  Ruth Barnes].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.co.in/books?id=nr2724-bOfMC&amp;dq=belly+button+sari&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s The cultures of economic migration: international perspectives – Suman Gupta, Tope Omoniyi].&lt;/ref&gt; However, sometimes, the navel is covered with the [[pallu]] in a low-rise non-transparent sari, as well.

Vitruvio Pollione Scientific High School, [[Avezzano]], central [[Italy]], asked students to stop wearing low-slung trousers that expose navels, underwear etc., Deputy Principal Nazzareno Desiderio elaborated in a phone interview: &quot;It's a piece of advice, for their educational reflection.&quot; Inspired by the decision in Avezzano, the principal of [[Rome]]'s Visconti High School Antonino Grasso had suggested that students show less skin and proposed a debate on the matter.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[File:Raima Sen still3.jpg|thumb|Actress [[Raima Sen]] in a [[Lehenga]] Style Saree]]
'''Lehenga style saree''' is a new trend of saree introduced in [[India]]. This is an aesthetic blend of the traditional [[saree]] and a lehenga choli. A lehenga style saree is normally 4.5 meters to 5.5 meters long. To wear one, unlike a sari, one doesn't have to form pleats but may simply 'tuck and drape'.

Like that of a traditional saree, the lehenga style saree is worn over a [[petticoat]] (inskirt, ''pavadai'' in the south, and ''shaya'' in eastern India), along with a designer [[blouse]] called the choli, which is the upper garment. The style&lt;ref name=&quot;Mohapatra&quot;&gt;Mohapatra, R. P. (1992) &quot;Fashion styles of ancient India&quot;, B. R. Publishing corporation, ISBN 81-7018-723-0&lt;/ref&gt; of [[choli]] mostly resembles that of the choli of a conventional Lehenga or [[Ghagra choli]]. Sometimes conventional blouses are also matched with lehenga style saree. The choli is mostly of a halter neck style, deep neck, or “backless” style. As with choli worn with the saree, these cholis are also embellished with [[kundan]], beads, mirrors etc.

==Origin==
Lehenga style saree is a form of ready-made saree that arose from the need of an artistic yet easy to wear party attire. The easy-to-wear option of the garment tells the ladies just to slip into it and be ready in minutes. Stitched as a long flared [[skirt]] with a zip at the side, it is made to the measurements of the wearer. The ensemble needs to be slipped in, then the wearer can fasten the zipper and drape the pallu over the shoulders. This is an outfit for ladies who are not comfortable with usual draping and pleating that the regular saree demands. This style of saree’s pallu has the dramatic effect of the matching [[dupatta]] of the conventional [[Gagra choli|Lehenga Choli]].

==Embroidery and embellishments==
Various types of embroidery patterns are employed according to the lehenga style saree.  Bagh, [[Chikan (embroidery)|Chikan]], Kashida, [[Kasuti]], Kantha, Sozni, Shisha, [[Zardozi]], etc. are some of the commonly practiced types of embroidery in the lehenga style saree.

Bagh is a special kind of embroidery done by women in Punjab to be worn during festivals and weddings. Bagh embroidery completely hides the base fabric and is a very heavy kind of embroidery. This embroidery on lehenga style saree is exquisite as often the cloth is barely visible and only the beautiful embroidery is easily seen. [[Kashida]] is a Kashmiri embroidery type. This is very colorful and depicts Kashmir in its patterns. The other famous embroidery on lehenga sarees is the [[Kantha]] work and Kasuti work of Bangalore.

Various rich and exquisite embellishments are used on lehenga style sarees patterns, which include silver embroidery, golden embroidery, metal beads, real pearls, wood beads, glass beads, mirror work, lace work, Kundan, sequins, glittering stones, zardozi, etc. Mostly rich fabrics like [[silk]], [[georgette (fabric)|georgette]], brasso, brocade, [[chiffon (fabric)|chiffon]], crepe, etc., are used in the making of a lehenga style saree.

In India, Sabyasachi Mukherjee is known for his lehenga style saree.

==Indian Draping a lehenga style saree==
Compared with traditional sarees, the method of draping&lt;ref name= &quot;Boulanger&quot;&gt;Boulanger, C (1997) Saris: An Illustrated Guide to the Indian Art of Draping, Shakti Press International, New York. ISBN 0-9661496-1-0&lt;/ref&gt; a lehenga style is relatively simple and hassle-free. The plain end of the saree is tucked into the petticoat/inskirt and wrapped once completely around the waist, similar to wearing a regular saree. Whereas pleats would be formed in a traditional saree, at this point with the lehenga style one continues to tuck in the drape without making any pleats. (In a lehenga style saree, pleats are replaced with embellished gotas or [[wikt:panel|panels]] at the front, which imparts a flared [[silhouette]] that is characteristic of a lehenga style saree.) Finally, the pallu is draped over the shoulder like a regular saree.

The only difference between a Lehenga style saree and a regular saree is that it doesn't require pleats to be formed at the front. A few lehenga style sarees come with side hooks too. The hook-it-and-fix technique fits the lehenga style saree snugly around the [[waist]].

'''Pencil Suit''' is a variety of [[salwar kameez]] which has become a recent fashion trend. This basically follows the principles of a [[pencil skirt]] and merges it with the traditional salwar kameez.

While salwars are loosely fitted pants, pencil suits have tightly fitted pants that follow the contours of the lady’s leg. It differs from the [[churidar]] only in the lack of the ruches or the “churis” near the ankle. The kameez is of thigh length and has a side seam left open below the waist-line. This attire is often marched with a [[dupatta]] of matching or contrasting color.

As most of the designer suits, a pencil suit is also embellished with beads, mirror work, [[zardozi]] or [[zari]] work. Simple and plain variants of the suit are also available for daily wear.

==Description==
The pencil [[trousers|pants]] are held up by a drawstring at the [[waist]]. The pants are fitted tightly against the contours of the lady’s leg and don’t have any extra cloth. Usually it is made of stretchable material to aid the easy movement and not to cause any discomfort to the lady while sitting down.

The pants completely narrow down towards the ankle and are held by a buttoned cuff at the ends. While conventional salwar kameez employs traditional cuts, crosscuts are used to stitch a pencil suit. This version of salwar kameez accentuates the curves of the female wearing it.

The kameez of the pencil suit is stitched as that of a regular [[kurta]]. Though the height of the kameez may vary according to the taste of the wearer, the usual style is to have it stitched at thigh length. A side seam is provided to aid easy movements and usually starts at the waist line. Different necklines are experimented with plunging [[neckline]], boat line, high necks or mandarin neckline.

It is customary to wear a dupatta along with a pencil suit though it is not mandatory. Nowadays the dupatta is just draped over the hands or used as a [[fashion accessory]]. The dupatta are made in diaphanous, shimmery [[fabrics]] for this reason.

==Pencil suit and Bollywood==
Though the pencil suit was designed first by leading designers of the [[fashion]] industry, it became popularized only through [[Bollywood]]. After being adapted by some famous lead protagonists of Bollywood, pencil suits became fashionable.

Apart from being worn in movies, the actresses opted for pencil suits to be worn at public functions and events too. This further accelerated the adaption of aencil suits into the wardrobe of college and officegoing ladies.

==Difference between pencil suit and churidar==
To a point the pencil suit can be called a variant of churidar; but a pencil suit differs very much from the churidar, whose name derives their name from the ‘churis’ or ruche they form as they end near the ankle. Pencil suit lacks any type of ‘churi’ or any extra cloth.

Extra cloth is provided at the thigh in churidar to aid easy movements and comfort to the lady wearing it. There is no extra cloth provision in pencil suit, but for the ease of the wearer it is made of elastic fabrics that can stretch easily.

[[File:Ring ceremony, Indian Hindu wedding.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|Bride in [[Sari]] and Groom in [[Sherwani]] in a [[Hindu wedding]]]]
'''Indian wedding clothes''' is the set of clothes worn by the [[bride]], [[bridegroom]] and other relatives attending the [[wedding]] during a marriage.

==Clothing culture==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Khara Dupatta.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Hyderabad, India]]n bride dressed in [[Khara Dupatta|Khada Dupatta]]]] --&gt;
In India, the wedding rituals and clothes make the wedding as much as that of the bride and her groom. Both look their splendid best in gorgeous clothes. Not just the couple, but the guests attending the family and the relatives are often seen dressed up to the teeth. The bride is dressed up in auspicious colors, whereas the bridegroom is dressed to exude a regal aura. The [[bridesmaid]]s and [[best man|best men]] are often dressed on a par with the bride and the groom. But they are toned down a bit because the day belongs to the couple. All the folks attending the marriage are decked out with gold [[jewelry]] including the bride and sometimes the groom. The ladies are additionally adorned with [[henna]] patterns all over their palms, hands, forearms, legs and feet. Sometimes henna patterns are replaced with [[Alta (dye)|alta]] designs which are short lived and easily removable.

Indian weddings generally tend to continue for several days and new attire is worn each day. All these dresses and the color symbolize the meaning of marriage and the period that follows it. Indian wedding is one that gives more importance to details like different rituals and the various attires one wears to attend them.

==Hindu wedding==
Indian [[Hindu wedding]]s continue for several days. India is a country that defines diversity and this is visible even in the wedding and its different styles. The ceremonies, the rituals, the formalities are all different between each region and culture. Unlike the Christians, Hindus wedding ceremony does not resemble the western marriages and are quite elaborate. In the North,Starting from the [[Tilak]] ceremony, each function has significance in the marriage. Tilak, [[Sangeet (music)|Sangeet]], [[Turmeric|Haldi]], [[Baraat]] and the [[South Asian wedding#Shaadi|Shaadi]], all necessitate the Bride and the bridegroom to wear new attire at each occasion.All these above ceremonies are known by different names in the other parts,e.g.:''Simant puja'' in the west,or ''Mangalasnanam'' in the south and so on.But have got the same significance all over.

===Bridegroom's clothes===
Many communities of South, West, and Eastern India still adhere to the traditional costumes, i.e. [[Dhoti]], or sometimes [[Lungi]], and [[Mundu]] by some communities of the South. Kurta or a shirt may be worn or sometimes just a ''Angavastram'' may be used to cover the chest.
On the other hand, in the Northern parts, the bridegroom usually wears a [[Sherwani]], [[Jodhpuri|Jodhpuri suit]], or a [[Suit (clothing)|western suit]]. The groom’s face is covered with a [[veil]]ed with a curtain of flowers which is called [[Sehra (headdress)|Sehra]] in the North, which is not the custom elsewhere. It is also customary to wear a [[Taqiyah]] all through the ceremony in Muslim marriages.

Many prefer to wear a Kurta. A Kurta can be worn with Salwar, or Dhoti.

A dazzling series of ensemble for bridegrooms include majestic sherwani, blended Indo-western suit and ethnic Jodhpuri suit. The exquisite shirts, coats, and jackets are designed with extra care and touch to bring out the magnanimity out of the bridegroom on the marriage day. Precious embellishments are studded into the collars and the cuffs of the bridegroom’s dress. Available both in simple cottons and splendid, royal raw silk, these [[Kurta]] Pyjamas are preferred mostly by the bridegrooms.

===Bride's clothes===
The bride wears a [[saree]] or a [[lehenga]] according to the [[Demography of India|region]]. Red is considered to be the most auspicious color in among Hindus. While the saree is preferred as the bridal dress in [[South India]], [[West India|West]], [[East India|East]] India, most brides of other parts of India prefer Lehenga, Gagra Choli and Odni as bridal dress.

==Christian wedding==
[[Christian marriage]] in India is mostly an adaption of [[Western culture|western]] wedding ceremonies. Here the bridegroom wears a western suit or [[tuxedo]]. The Bride usually opts for a silk saree or a western [[gown]].

==Bridesmaid and family==

The typical Indian Hindu marriage ceremony does not usually have the concept of bridesmaids. But in many Hindu weddings women in family often prefers to wear either a [[sari]], [[lahenga]], [[anarkali salwar suit]] or simple [[salwar kamiz]]. Contemporary and Indo-western wear has also started gaining popularity among Indian women as wedding wear.

A '''crew neck'''  is a type of [[shirt]] or [[sweater]] that has a round [[neckline]] and no [[Collar (clothing)|collar]], often worn with other layers.&lt;ref name=&quot;mw&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/crew+neck |title=Crew neck |publisher=Merriam-Webster Online |accessdate=2 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=ZTEaAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=-CUEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=7240,1997423&amp;dq=crew-neck+sweater+college&amp;hl=en |title=Sweaters Go Bulky |date=25 August 1957 |work=[[Milwaukee Journal Sentinel]] |page=2|accessdate=2 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[T-shirt]] crew neck was developed in 1932 as an [[undergarment]] that would absorb [[sweat]] and prevent [[shoulder pad]]s of [[American football]] players from causing [[chafing (skin)|chafing]].&lt;ref name=&quot;kirby&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.90thidpg.us/Equipment/Articles/Tshirts/index.html |title=90th IDPG History of the T-shirt During WW2 |last=Kirby |first=Michael B.|date=Spring 2008 |publisher=90th Infantry Division Preservation Group |accessdate=2 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]] was the first of the [[United States Armed Forces|U.S. armed forces]] to adopt the crew-neck T-shirt or &quot;Gob Shirt&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;kirby&quot; /&gt;

In some German American neighborhoods in the North East parts of the United States, &quot;Scoopy Neck&quot; sweat shirts are still referred to by the German word &quot;Schrank&quot;.  This is especially true for grey crew neck sweatshirts.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

The '''2010s'''  have thus far been defined by a revival of [[1940s fashion|austerity era]] period pieces, [[Hipster (contemporary subculture)|hipster]] fashion, [[1980s in fashion|1980s]] neon colors, and from late 2012 to 2016, unisex [[1990s in fashion|early 1990s]] styles influenced by grunge&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.today.com/style/return-teen-spirit-grunge-back-fashion-thats-not-bad-thing-6C10984421|title=Return of 'Teen Spirit'?

In the early 2010s, many [[2000–2009 in fashion|mid and late 2000s fashions]] remained popular in Europe, the United States, Latin America, Australasia and East Asia, especially the [[indie pop]] look which largely drew upon elements of [[1970s in fashion|1970s]] [[garage rock]], the [[1960s fashion|1960s]] counterculture, and contemporary [[alternative fashion]]. Popular global fashion brands include [[Forever 21]], [[Topshop]], [[Topman]], [[Uniqlo]], [[Christian Dior]], [[Hollister Co.|Hollister]], [[Abercrombie and Fitch]], [[Ben Sherman]], [[Lacoste]], [[Penshoppe]], [[Bench (Philippine clothing brand)|Bench]], [[H&amp;M]], [[Nine West]], Kashieca, Human, [[Burberry]] (especially in China from 2010–15),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailymail.co.uk/money/markets/article-3274628/Burberry-s-bubble-bursts-Beijing-woes-hit-sales-1-295-trenchcoats-895-ponchos-sparking-shares-nosedive-bonus-cuts.html Burberry bubble bursts, 24 Oct 2015]&lt;/ref&gt; Monsoon, [[River Island]], [[Dorothy Perkins]], Coach, [[Marks and Spencer]], [[Hugo Boss]], and Alberto.

====1980s influences====
* The early 2010s saw many recycled fashions from the [[1950s fashion|1950s]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://uk.specials.lifestyle.yahoo.com/style-it-light/guest-column-detail/be-inspired-by-the-hour%E2%80%99s-fifties-fashion-3254 |title=Style it light |publisher=Uk.specials.lifestyle.yahoo.com |date= |accessdate=2012-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[1970s in fashion|1970s]] and [[1980s in fashion|1980s]] as designers from stores like [[Topshop]] replicated original [[vintage clothing]]. In the United States, it was popular to wear [[Gucci]], [[Chanel]], or [[Versace]] designer clothing, and neon colors such as pink, green, teal, black, purple, magenta and yellow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.neonfiller.com/wordpress/ |title=Neon filter: indie and alternative website |publisher=Neonfiller.com |date= |accessdate=2012-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Popular tops for American, British and Australian women aged 20–50 included [[tunic]]s, 1980s style [[baseball jacket]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thetenbest.co.uk/the-ten-best-baseball-jackets/ |title=Womens baseball jackets |publisher=Thetenbest.co.uk |date=2011-01-28 |accessdate=2012-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; oversized [[cardigan (sweater)|cardigan]]s, [[western shirt]]s, 2fer and layered shirts and tees, dresses and shirts worn with belts, [[Perfecto motorcycle jacket]]s customized with [[Shirt stud|stud]]s,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.schottnyc.com/about.cfm One for the History Books] Schott NYC&lt;/ref&gt; floral [[camisole]]s worn with matching [[boyshorts]], and [[sundress]]es. European women wear sparkly dresses, baggy one-size-fits-all [[Empire line]] skirts, [[blouse]]s and dresses, and lace, figure-hugging white [[organza]] [[maxi dress]]es inspired by [[Pippa Middleton]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/royal-wedding/8484342/Royal-wedding-Pippa-Middleton-shines-as-maid-of-honour.html |title=Pippa Middleton shines as Maid of Honor |publisher=Telegraph.co.uk |date= 2011-04-29|accessdate=2012-01-21 |location=London |first=Anita |last=Singh}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* From 2010 to 2013 many late 2000s fashion trends remained popular in Europe, the United States, East Asia, and Latin America, especially  [[acid wash]] [[skinny jeans]], &quot;trouser-dresses&quot;, [[romper suit]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.azcentral.com/style/fashion/articles/2009/04/29/20090429jumpsuit.html |publisher=AZ Central |title=Jumpsuits are one-piece wonders |deadurl=no |accessdate=2013-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Stuff.co.nz_624892&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/life-style/fashion/624892 |title=One-piece rompers seen as hot outfit for spring |date=12 September 2008 |agency=[[Reuters]] |work=[[Stuff.co.nz]] |accessdate=5 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[preppy]] pastel colored skinny jeans, and [[capri pants]] cropped at the ankle. Possibly due to the poor economy in the early years, the [[skirt|midi skirt and the maxi skirt]] were the most common skirt and dress styles, with the hemline standards being the longest they had been since [[The Great Depression]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marketoracle.co.uk/Article36125.html |title=What Skirt Lengths Tell You About The Stock Market |accessdate=January 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*Continuing on from the late 2000s, [[Fashion in India]] moved away from [[clothing in India|traditional clothes]] like the [[saree]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://gulfnews.com/news/asia/india/wife-s-jeans-ban-is-grounds-for-divorce-india-court-rules-1.1353273 Wifes Jeans ban grounds for divorce]&lt;/ref&gt; and glamorous [[Bollywood]] style dresses in favor of a [[Indo-Western fashion|more Westernized style]] that incorporated navy pants, [[blazer]]s, [[leather jacket]]s, [[waistcoat]]s and androgynous military jackets.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vogue.in/content/the-redefined-salwar-kurta-is-here/ Redefined salwar kurta is here]&lt;/ref&gt; Popular casual footwear included leather [[dress boot]]s, [[stiletto]] heels, platform sandals, and open toe pumps.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vogue.in/content/the-redefined-salwar-kurta-is-here/ Redefined salwar kurta]&lt;/ref&gt; Cream, grey, blue and orange [[Kurta]] dresses with side slits&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vogue.in/content/modern-indian-20-new-kurtas-own/ Vogue Modern Indian]&lt;/ref&gt; decorated with pink or purple embroidery and synthetic jewels were worn with jeans or leggings, [[T shirt]]s, [[tank top]]s and [[bat wing]] sleeve blouses were paired with traditional silk [[salwar]] [[pajama]]s&lt;ref&gt;[http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/bollywood-influence-on-fashion-trends/1/230516.html Bollywood trends waning]&lt;/ref&gt;  or short shorts, and the large hoop earrings declined in popularity in favor of smaller minimalist gold jewelery.

====Neon colors====
* Neon colors and elaborate T-shirts were popular for much of the early 2010s, especially graphic print [[hoodie]]s, novelty socks, red or blue [[skinny jeans]], studded belts with large buckles, and [[Ed Hardy]] T-shirts embellished with [[rhinestone]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Adam Fox |url=http://www.askmen.com/fashion/fashiontip_400/480_what-not-to-wear.html |title=What not to wear |publisher=Askmen.com |date=2011-12-23 |accessdate=2012-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====1990s revival====
* In the summer of 2012, [[1990s in fashion|early 1990s inspired fashion]] made a comeback in the UK among men. This included bright colored short shorts, jeans shorts with a [[stone wash]] or [[acid wash]], shirts with [[Aztec]] patterns, [[Maya civilization|Mayan]] patterns, camouflage prints or animal prints, [[flannel]] shirts, [[high tops|high top sneakers]], [[Snapback (hat)|snapback hats]], and gaudy [[wristwatch]]es.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fashionbeans.com/2012/trending-era-the-90s/ |title=Men’s Fashion Trend: Channelling The 1990s |accessdate=23 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In America, the trend caught on in 2013. The [[1990s in fashion#Grunge Look|Grunge look]] had made a comeback due to the influence of [[Steves Peeps]], an American artist famous for designing the costumes of pop star [[Lady Gaga]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.buzzfeed.com/jasonsmith/interview-with-steves-peeps-3muj Steve Peeps interview]&lt;/ref&gt; Common upper items of clothing include [[bomber jacket]]s, black leather jackets, [[crombie (clothing)|crombie]] overcoats, padded [[tartan]] [[overshirt]]s, [[crewneck]] [[sweatshirts]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://metro.co.uk/2014/11/17/its-official-there-will-be-200-more-christmas-jumpers-on-the-streets-this-year-4951164/ 200% increase in Xmas jumpers]&lt;/ref&gt; oversized [[flannel]] shirts, [[throwback uniform|throwback]] [[basketball]] or [[baseball uniform]]s, and [[preppy]] [[Nantucket Reds]].

====Business casual====
* The [[business casual]] look of the 1990s and early 2000s remained common in many parts of America, with jeans, [[loafers]], [[boat shoe]]s and sneakers being seen as acceptable to wear in the workplace.&lt;ref name=Devolution&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vanityfair.com/unchanged/2012/01/prisoners-of-style-201201 |title=You Say You Want a Devolution? |publisher=[[Vanity Fair (magazines)|Vanity Fair]] |date=December 31, 2011 |accessdate=2015-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The decline in the formality of men's fashion that started in the 1960s continued until 2012, with men wearing informal clothing on a regular basis, even at work or while travelling, as an apparent extension of [[Beau Brummell]]'s older idea that gentlemen shouldn't try to outshine the ladies for attention.&lt;ref name=SecondRevolution&gt;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://takimag.com/article/the_second_revolution_in_menswear#ixzz1gVJ6DJZL |title=The Second Revolution in Menswear |publisher=[[Taki's Magazine]] |date=December 14, 2011 |accessdate=2015-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; This contrasted to Britain, Italy, Europe, and the urban Northeastern US, where more formal [[Mad Men]] inspired business clothing such as slim-fitting grey suits had made a comeback in the workplace during the [[2000s in fashion#Slim-fit Suits|late 2000s and early 2010s]].&lt;ref&gt;See the &quot;Mid-2010s&quot; section covering formal wear.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Urban fashion====
[[ file: supreme2015awesome.jpeg|thumbnail|Urban fashion brand [[Supreme (clothing)|Supreme]] model 2015]]
* In 2014, men's fashion was heavily influenced by the improving economy and fashion-conscious cities such as [[London]], [[New York City]], [[Paris]], and [[Milan]], as well as imitating elements of luxury fashion. Bright colors (especially the [[Ed Hardy]] shirts) went out of style in favor of black, white, [[beige]], [[taupe]], [[gray]], and various shades of dark [[green]]. Clothing items included tailored sweatpants, jersey shirts, chunky hiking boots with thick soles,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/men/fashion-and-style/11316478/Ten-of-the-best-winter-work-boots-for-men.html?frame=3150290 Top 10 mens winter boots]&lt;/ref&gt; [[bomber jacket]]s, leather jackets, denim jackets, thick oversized coats, double-breasted jackets and blazers,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dmarge.com/2014/12/2014-review-hottest-mens-fashion-trends.html |title=2014 IN REVIEW: THE HOTTEST MEN’S FASHION TRENDS |accessdate=January 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; shorts riding above the knee (toward a 5&quot; inseam, down from 15&quot;),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702304831304579546312161483266|accessdate=2015-03-08|date=2014-05-09|title=A New Length for Men's Shorts|author=David Colman|work=The Wall Street Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt; and jogger pants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/jogger-pants-are-taking-over-menswear-2014-8 |title=Sweatpants Are The Hottest New Trend In Menswear |accessdate=January 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sales in floral print clothing designs for men more than doubled amongst fashion retailers between 2013 and 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-2614713/Men-embrace-flower-power-Floral-designs-130-boys-shop-hot-new-trend.html | location=London | work=Daily Mail | title=Floral designs in menswear up 130% as boys embrace hot new trend | date=2014-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* From 2014 onwards, the [[Grandfather shirt|grandfather collar]] shirt emerged as a semi-casual fashion item in western cultures, traditionally being a formal or manual work garment.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fashionbeans.com/2014/mens-ss14-micro-trend-bandgrandad-collar-shirts/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://theknowledgeblog.co.uk/the-history-of-the-grandad-collar-shirt/&lt;/ref&gt; In China and Europe, retro [[feiyue]] martial arts sneakers in red, white and blue made a comeback.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.yahoo.com/style/the-new-summer-must-have-sneakers-119030492648.html Feiyue sneakers]&lt;/ref&gt;

As part of the general 1980s revival, the [[waistcoat]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://uk.askmen.com/style/fashion_advice/fashion-sense-three-piece-suit.html Three piece suit]&lt;/ref&gt; made a comeback as part of the [[three piece suit]] in Europe and the US.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-1215158/As-Tesco-Aldi-launch-cut-price-ensembles-man-look-good-18-suit.html Tesco suit]&lt;/ref&gt;  In the early 2010s these suits were mostly [[charcoal grey]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://uk.askmen.com/grooming/appearance/wardrobe-mistakes.html Wardrobe mistakes]&lt;/ref&gt; steel grey and silver, but by 2014 these were joined by [[air force blue]], [[navy blue]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://uk.askmen.com/style/fashion_trends/2015-suit-styles.html 2015 suits]&lt;/ref&gt; [[midnight blue]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://uk.askmen.com/video/entertainment-and-celebrities/saville-rows-finest-tailors-skyfalls-midnight-blue-tuxedo.html Savile Row]&lt;/ref&gt; and sky blue.

{{Main|Hipster (contemporary subculture)}}
[[File:Taylor red tour.jpg|thumb|right|Taylor Swift wearing hipster fashion during Red Tour, 2012.]]
* By the early 2010s, British, American, and Filipino indie clothing had moved away from the bright colors and overt 1960s styling of the mid-2000s in favor of a more &quot;grown up&quot; intellectual look, with 1990s style earth-tones like grey, burgundy, brown, teal, and beige.&lt;ref&gt;[http://uk.askmen.com/fine_living/galleries/hipster-s-guide-to-america.html Hipsters guide to America]&lt;/ref&gt; [[tweed cloth|Tweed]] jackets, skinny [[chino trousers]], [[dress boots]], 2fer and layered shirts and tees, [[cardigan sweater]]s, nerdy [[horn-rimmed glasses]], sweaters, thick wool socks, worker boots, [[leggings]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://fashion.telegraph.co.uk/news-features/TMG9731615/Men-in-tights-how-meggings-are-taking-fashion-by-storm.html Men in tights]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Knit cap|beanies]] replaced the &lt;ref&gt;[http://uk.askmen.com/fashion/trends_500/553_hipster-trends-we-hate.html hipster trends we hate]&lt;/ref&gt; [[winklepickers]], [[velvet]] jackets, [[Ray-Ban Aviator|Aviator sunglasses]], and skinny ties typically worn by [[indie rock]] bands, although vintage [[Western shirt]]s, [[leather jacket]]s, military [[dress uniforms]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wildcat.arizona.edu/article/2012/09/how-to-get-a-hipster-guy-to-notice-you-fashion-clothing-092412 Arizona daily wildcat]&lt;/ref&gt; homemade jewelery, and [[thrift store chic]] plaid shirts remained popular in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://vintagefashionguild.org/ |title=Vintage fashion guild |publisher=Vintage fashion guild |date= |accessdate=2012-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Drop crotch pants, designed by the Danish brand Hümor, became more and more popular in Europe amongst hipsters and [[hip hop]] fans, who replaced their [[skinny jeans]] and [[carpenter jeans]] with &quot;old school but modern&quot; style.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.humoer.dk/]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Scene kids}}
*From 2010-2013, the androgynous '''[[Scene (subculture)|scene subculture]]''' (also known regionally as &quot;Shamate&quot; and &quot;Coloridos&quot;) remained common in the West Coast United States, Europe, Australasia, parts of Asia,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.buzzfeed.com/kevintang/meet-shamate-chinas-most-hated-subculture China's most hated subculture (03-29-2015)]&lt;/ref&gt; and Latin America, especially in the Brazilian city of [[Fortaleza]].&lt;ref name=&quot;adolescenciaesaude.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.adolescenciaesaude.com/detalhe_artigo.asp?id=269 |title=Adolescence, 'emo' culture and health: the viewpoint of Fortaleza's teenagers |publisher=Adolescência e Saúde magazine, UERJ (Rio de Janeiro State University) |date= |accessdate=2012-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The style was influenced by hip-hop, emo, Japanese street style, and [[indie pop]] fashion, especially [[skinny jeans]], [[trucker hats]], [[Nike shoes]], mismatched [[neon green]], [[fluorescent]] yellow, bright blue or [[hot pink]] socks worn with sneakers, [[Vans]], [[Levi's]] 501 [[jeans]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://uk.askmen.com/fashion/apparel/levis-501-jeans.html Levis 501s]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dickies]] shorts, [[pocket watch]]es,&lt;ref&gt;[http://uk.askmen.com/fashion/mens-watches_700/705_pocket-watches.html Pocket watches]&lt;/ref&gt; [[flannel]] shirts, thin [[Necktie|ties]], [[Nike Elite]] crew socks guys and girls, [[Chucks]], [[Keds]], vintage tees sometimes featuring [[pop art]] designs,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Farah Averill |url=http://uk.askmen.com/fashion/trends_150/194_fashion_men.html |title=T shirt trends |publisher=Askmen.com |date= |accessdate=2012-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; plain tees with contrasting edging, and [[Vans]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uk.askmen.com/fashion/apparel/vans-shoes.html |title=Vans |publisher=Askmen.com |date= |accessdate=2012-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shirts and [[hoodie]]s with messages such as &quot;cool story bro&quot; or the logos of music like [[Asking Alexandria]], [[Blood on the Dance Floor (duo)|Blood on the Dance Floor]] and [[Bring Me the Horizon]] became popular among [[scene kids]]. By 2012, many [[scene kids]] had abandoned the cartoon print [[hoodie]]s, [[skinny jeans]] and studded belts in favor of a more [[hardcore punk|hardcore]]/[[skate punk]] look with short hair, [[Sleeveless shirt|A-shirts]], plain hoodies, [[combat boot]]s, Vans, skinny jeans, and [[stretching (body piercing)|stretched earlobe piercings]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Fashion&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author=Fashion|url=http://caniwear.it/wiki/hardcore-punk/ |title=Hardcore punk fashion |publisher=Caniwear.it |date=2011-01-12 |accessdate=2012-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''[[Seapunk]],''' a fusion of scene, [[electronic dance music]] and [[hipster (contemporary subculture)|hipster]] culture, began as an online internet meme before becoming a niche street fashion in America.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/04/fashion/Seapunk-a-Web-Joke-With-Music-Has-Its-Moment.html?_r=0 Little Mermaid Goes Punk]&lt;/ref&gt; This movement influenced several mainstream pop and [[hip-hop]] artists during the mid 2010s, most notably [[Azealia Banks]] and [[Rihanna]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://salacioussound.com/2012/11/rihanna-azealia-banks-and-the-commoditization-of-seapunk/ Commodisation of seapunk]&lt;/ref&gt; Seapunks often combined brightly dyed androgynous hairstyles&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theguardian.com/culture/2014/mar/20/youth-subcultures-where-have-they-gone 2010s subcultures]&lt;/ref&gt; with nautical themes such as mermaids or dolphins, plastic [[Ray Ban wayfarers]], [[undercut (hairstyle)|undercut]] hairstyles, shell jewelery, feathers, [[tartan]] overshirts associated with the [[surfer]] subculture, 1990s inspired [[yin-yang]] T-shirts, [[baseball cap]]s, [[tie dye]], transparent plastic jackets,&lt;ref&gt;[http://theclustermag.com/2011/12/the-abyss-seapunk-splishsplash-oceangang/ The Abyss]&lt;/ref&gt; lots of green, blue, turquoise, [[cyan]] or [[aquamarine (color)|aquamarine]] clothing, [[smiley]] motifs, and red and blue 3-Dimensional images.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spin.com/articles/azealia-banks-rihanna-seapunk-beef-saturday-night-live-video/ Seapunks salty over Rihanna]&lt;/ref&gt;

Independent brands have risen to popularity, as well as floral print items and tie-dye items. Button-down shirts are often worn fully buttoned.
* Fashion designers such as [[Riccardo Tisci]] and [[Rick Owens]] begin to gain a new popularity within hip hop, popularized by rappers such as [[Kanye West]] and [[A$AP Rocky]]. Such designers inspire a &quot;darker&quot; aesthetic involving monochromatic colour schemes (usually black or grey), extra-long shirts usually sporting over-sized neck openings and asymmetrical hems, skinny jeans that are worn with long inseams and an aggressive taper to cause bunching up or &quot;stacks&quot; near the ankle (a style heavily popularized and sported by Kanye) and high-top sneakers. Black boots, leather jackets, denim vests, bombers, monochrome sports jerseys, waxed jeans, black varsity jackets, tapered sweatpants, drop-crotch trousers, layering shorts over leggings and occasionally floral print are all popular trends within this style as well. Other notable rappers that sport this look include [[Kendrick Lamar]], [[Danny Brown (rapper)|Danny Brown]], and [[Pusha T]].

===Cholo and chicano===
{{Main|Mexican pointy boots}}
* In Mexico and the Southwestern US during the early 2010s, many members of the [[cholo]], [[chicano]] and [[lowrider]] subcultures combine [[hip-hop fashion]] with [[Western shirt]]s, traditional [[charro]] jackets, [[Stetson]] hats, [[skinny jeans]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gee |first=Are |url=http://everydayreal.blogspot.com/2010/06/style-watch-chuntaro-style.html |title=Chuntaro style |publisher=Everydayreal.blogspot.com |date=2010-06-10 |accessdate=2012-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Cowboy boots]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-1387604/How-Mexican-men-embraced-bizarre-trend-pointed-footwear |title=html Mexican men wearing pointed boots |publisher=Dailymail.co.uk |date= 2011-05-16|accessdate=2012-01-21 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; with elongated toes. These 3&amp;nbsp;ft long &quot;[[Mexican pointy boots]],&quot; associated with [[Tribal-guarachero]] music are an extreme version of the '60s-inspired [[Winklepickers]] popular in mid-2000s Britain.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theblaze.com/stories/2011/05/16/your-eyes-arent-deceiving-you-3-feet-long-pointy-boots-are-the-craze-in-mexico/]&lt;/ref&gt;
* By 2015, many young [[chicano]]s on the American West Coast had abandoned the garish Western inspired clubwear in favor of a more authentic 1950s inspired look. [[Pachuco]] style [[Zoot suit]]s, [[fedora]]s and [[panama hat]]s made a comeback,&lt;ref&gt;[http://compasscultura.com/east-los-angeles-beat-barrio/ Beat of the Barrio]&lt;/ref&gt; together with more typical casual [[rockabilly]] fashions for everyday wear such as slim jeans, black leather jackets, [[bowling shirt]]s, brightly colored blouses and flouncy skirts for girls, [[polka dot]] dresses with petticoats, and flowers worn in the hair.&lt;ref&gt;[http://latino.foxnews.com/latino/lifestyle/2015/10/22/barrio-boogie-back-proud-chicanos-reenact-bygone-pachuco-days-in-la/ Barrio boogie]&lt;/ref&gt;

===K-pop and Jejemon===
[[File:PSY GangnamStyle Suwon15logo (8031994935).jpg|thumb|right|K-Pop singer Psy]]
* Due to the spread of [[Hallyu Wave]] worldwide, millions of Asian and Asian-American youths have become addicted to [[K-Pop]]. These are the people who love listening to South Korean music and follow the style of artists and pop groups like [[Big Bang]], [[Wonder Girls]], [[Kim Soo Hyun]], or [[Gangnam Style]] singer [[Psy (rapper)|Psy]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hngn.com/articles/141702/20151019/kpop-kim-soo-hyun-former-wonder-girls-sohee-dating.htm Kim Soo Hyun]&lt;/ref&gt; Since the Korean girl and boy bands wore extravagant clothing, some of the hardcore fans in China, Korea, America and the Philippines tried to copy their idols and started wearing K-Pop style hairstyles and clothing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newyorker.com/news/evan-osnos/why-china-lacks-gangnam-style China lacks gangnam style]&lt;/ref&gt; These included skull, floral or honeycomb prints, monochromatic shirts, silk jackets featuring stylized Asian art prints or [[pop art]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://style.mtv.com/2013/06/27/g-dragon-ambush-clothing/ MTV K-pop clothing]&lt;/ref&gt; leather skirts, black and neon printed leggings, retro joggers, short shorts, black and gold jewelery, brightly colored [[tuxedo]] jackets, tracksuits, basketball shirts, leather caps, and sequined or glitter jackets.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/oct/13/big-bang-review-k-pop-heroes-deliver-candyfloss-hooks Big Bang]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/music/a-year-after-gangnam-style-k-pop-continues-to-make-its-mark-in-america/2013/11/07/cb161c56-431f-11e3-a751-f032898f2dbc_story.html K-pop in America]&lt;/ref&gt;
*During the early part of the 2010s, a new youth subculture called [[Jejemon]] arose in the Philippines, sparking a brief [[moral panic]] among some older conservatives and other youths.&lt;ref&gt;[http://iskwiki.upd.edu.ph/index.php/A_WORLD_WITHIN_THE_WORLD_THE_JEJEMONS_AS_THE_OTHER_CULTURE#.ViV8Oyt2FIE Jejemon as the other]&lt;/ref&gt; The Philippine Daily Inquirer describes Jejemons as a &quot;new breed of hipster who have developed not only their own language and written text but also their own subculture and fashion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/story/192844/lifestyle/artandculture/we-are-all-jejemons We are all Jejemons]&lt;/ref&gt; These predominantly working class youths are associated with wearing trucker hats and use their own language through texting and via social media such as [[Facebook]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://globalvoices.org/2010/05/16/philippines-the-jejemon-craze/ Jejemon craze]&lt;/ref&gt; They are often criticized by others for not using the words properly; even the Department of Education discouraged  use of the Jejemon language. Apart from the language, the Jejemons were also criticized for their fashion and manners. From early 2013 onwards, with the rise of smartphones which began to overtake feature phones in terms of sales in the country, the phenomenon seems to have made a gradual decline in mainstream popularity.

Women's hairstyles in the early 2010s have been fairly individualistic, although many British, Australian, Russian, Korean, and continental European women keep their hair simplistic and traditionally long, from straight to wavy with a centre or side parting. Bangs were often either side swept or left straight down above the eyes,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.allure.com/beauty-trends/blogs/daily-beauty-reporter/2015/02/fifty-shades-of-grey-bangs.html&lt;/ref&gt; and many women also use [[hair extensions]] to make their hair look much longer and fuller.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.slate.com/articles/life/doonan/2012/05/hair_extensions_why_are_they_so_insanely_popular_.html&lt;/ref&gt; In America&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marieclaire.com/beauty/hair/g412/curly-hair-how-to-hairstyles/?slide=2 Gwen Stefani]&lt;/ref&gt; and Israel,&lt;ref&gt;[http://jewcy.com/jewish-news/the-new-york-times-dont-stress-curly-hair-is-cool New York Times]&lt;/ref&gt; volumized curly hair,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sofeminine.co.uk/beauty/album733399/hairstyles-2013-haircuts-2013-women-hair-styles-2013-17351513.html#p52 So Feminine]&lt;/ref&gt; [[perm]]s and crimped hair were briefly fashionable from 2010–12,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.allure.com/hair-ideas/2012/the-best-haircuts-for-curly-hair#slide=5 10 haircuts for curly hair]&lt;/ref&gt; especially in [[New York]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.essence.com/2011/05/10/hot-hair-street-style-curly-hair Essence street style 2011]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stylisheve.com/2012-curly-hairstyles-for-women/ Curly womens hairstyles]&lt;/ref&gt; Traditional and intricate styles such as a [[bun (hairstyle)|bun]], [[chignon (hairstyle)|chignon]], [[French twist (hairstyle)|French twist]], [[updo]], [[crown braid]], or [[French braid]], inspired by [[the Hunger Games]]' [[Katniss Everdeen]], are also popular among young women and girls.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-2507394/From-Minnie-Mouse-Buns-Katniss-braids-Mother-shows-create-unique-hairstyles-using-daughters-models.html Unique hairstyles]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://uk.celebrity.yahoo.com/gossip/omg/megan-fox-looks-unrecognisable-with-blonde-hair-in-full-1980s-style-153310836.html Megan Fox]&lt;/ref&gt;

From 2012-16, many [[African-American]], Black Canadian,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.torontosun.com/2015/12/04/tdsb-accused-of-targeting-black-students-hair-styles Toronto Sun]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Afro-Caribbean]] British women favored natural, [[Afro-textured hair]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marieclaire.com/beauty/hair/how-to/g416/black-hairstyles-and-haircuts/ Marie Clare]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[dreadlocks]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.blackenterprise.com/news/marine-corps-authorizes-lock-and-twist-hairstyles-for-women/ Dreadlocks authorized in military]&lt;/ref&gt; in reaction to the damage caused by relaxers which were extremely popular in the early 2000s, opting instead for natural products to style their hair. During the mid 2010s, some also choose to wear weaves and wigs to achieve their desired looks without having the damage of relaxers.

In the mid 2010s, some men wore their hair in a type of [[Chonmage|topknot]] or &quot;man bun&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mensxp.com/grooming/hair-care/21433-hairstyle-in-focus-the-man-bun.html Man bun]&lt;/ref&gt; reminiscent of the [[samurai hairstyle]]s&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.manlycurls.com/2013/04/samurai-hairstyle-curly-men-hair-bun/ Samurai bun]&lt;/ref&gt; in [[wuxia]] movies. This trend was popularised by celebrities including actor [[Orlando Bloom]], [[Jared Leto]], [[TOWIE]]'s [[Joey Essex]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-2570190/Joey-Essex-sports-tiniest-ponytails-rest-hair-slicked-steps-belted-leather-jacket.html Joey Essex]&lt;/ref&gt; and pop singers [[Harry Styles]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-2555336/Rise-Man-Bun.html Man bun]&lt;/ref&gt; and  [[Zayn Malik]].

====Youth====
For young girls, tween and teen girls, and college girls the [[bangs (hairstyle)|bangs]] and thin [[headband]] combination has remained popular. Braids, side ponytails, and a single chunky side braid are popular styles with longer hair. Side parting hair is popular, and [[ponytail]]s are often worn when exercising or playing sports. The chin length [[bob cut]], long hair with choppy side bangs, and straight middle parted longer hair are also popular styles in the US, UK, New Zealand and Australia.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

In the UK, Middle East,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/explainer/2010/07/whence_the_mullet.html Iran bans mullets]&lt;/ref&gt; and Australia during the early 2010s, a type of short [[mullet haircut]] with buzzed sides and bleached blond streaks became popular among male [[chav]]s, teenage [[Irish travellers]], and urban youths of Iranian&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/jul/06/iran-bans-the-mullet The Guardian]&lt;/ref&gt; and Lebanese descent&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2009/03/01/1235842248410.html Sydney Morning Herald]&lt;/ref&gt; inspired by [[The Combination (film)|The Combination]] crime film.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2009/04/comb-a02.html The Combination]&lt;/ref&gt; By 2012, a long [[undercut (haircut)|undercut]] or [[Mohawk hairstyle|mohawk]]-like haircut, in which only one side of the head is buzzed, became popular among circles of [[rave]]rs, [[metalcore]], and [[dubstep]] fans in the US, inspired by [[Skrillex]].{{citation needed|date=September 2014}} The [[emo]] style [[fringe (hair)|fringe]]s also went out of fashion around the same time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Farah Averill |url=http://www.askmen.com/fashion/fashiontip_400/469b_hairstyles-women-hate.html |title=Hairstyles women hate |publisher=Askmen.com |date=2011-12-23 |accessdate=2012-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.novafm.com.au/article_my-chemical-romance-say-emo-is-dead-warn-the-angry-kids_104760 MCR say emo is dead]&lt;/ref&gt;

For boys, teen guys and college guys in The United States, Canada, Australasia, the UK and Korea,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nknews.org/2014/03/why-kim-jong-un-hairstyle-order-is-unlikely-true/ Kim Jong Un haircut popular among Korean college students]&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Undercut (haircut)|layered short hair style]], the [[buzzcut|buzzed short hairstyle which is blended from the sides to the top]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/4157121.stm War on long hair]&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Blowout (hairstyle)]] became popular during the mid 2010s due to continued interest in 1980s and [[1990s fashion]]. Additionally the [[Mod haircut|side swept bangs]], the [[quiff]], and the [[surfer hair|layered longer hair]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kidzcuts.co.nz/boys.html]&lt;/ref&gt; of the late 2000s remain fashionable among American [[preppy]] guys.

===Makeup and cosmetics===
In Britain, the minimalist makeup, neon 1980s inspired colors, and smoky eye look of the late 2000s carried on as a trend in many parts of the country. In other areas, these went out of fashion as women sought to imitate the [[fake tan]] and thick &quot;Scouse brow&quot; popularized by [[Kate Middleton]] and the cast of ''[[The Only Way is Essex]]'' and ''[[Desperate Scousewives]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-2173045/The-Kate-effect-Sales-eyebrow-products-600-women-rush-recreate-Duchesss-sophisticated-Scouse-Brow.html The Kate effect]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Body modifications===
Continuing on from the 1990s and 2000s, [[body modification]]s remained popular among many teenagers&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-2639204/Willow-Smith-13-wears-nose-ring-paired-Rasta-accessories-shops-flea-market.html Willow Smith]&lt;/ref&gt; and blue collar men and women in Britain,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-2721164/Weve-bricks-eggs-thrown-house-dress-Couple-live-entire-life-1950s-clothing-overcome-horrendous-abuse-win-national-vintage-competition.html Mr and Mrs Vintage UK]&lt;/ref&gt; Japan,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-2545271/The-worlds-spectacular-tattoos-revealed.html Most spectacular tattoos]&lt;/ref&gt; Israel,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3113947/Tat-s-got-hurt-Man-hangs-MEAT-HOOKS-model-tattooed-eyeballs-gets-ink-added-face-Israeli-body-art-convention.html Israeli tattoo convention]&lt;/ref&gt; New Zealand and Australia.&lt;ref name=Devolution/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2727033/Tattoo-artists-enthusiasts-world-come-celebrate-culture-body-ink.html Australian tattooists]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Old school tattoo]]s were popularised by female celebrities like [[Kat Von Dee]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-2042158/Did-love-rat-Jesse-James-cheat-Kat-Von-D.html | location=London | work=Daily Mail | title=Did love rat Jesse James cheat on Kat Von D? | date=2011-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; imitating the [[pinup girl]]s of the 1950s,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-1325266/Jesse-Jamess-tattooed-girlfriend-Kat-Von-D-puss-kinky-boots.html Kat Von Dee]&lt;/ref&gt; and by men like footballer [[David Beckham]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-2737830/David-Beckham-falls-motorbike-leaves-Hollywood-tattoo-parlour-escapes-unharmed.html Beckham tattoo]&lt;/ref&gt; pop star Harry Styles&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-2290950/Harry-Styles-gets-tattoo-reveals-HUGE-butterfly-design-stomach.html Harry's butterfly tat]&lt;/ref&gt; or [[Justin Bieber]] aspiring for the &quot;tough guy&quot; look.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-2516059/Justin-Bieber-posts-picture-getting-tattoo-Sydney-concert.html Bieber Tat]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[earring]]s and [[tongue piercing]]s&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1271239/Tongue-piercing-ruptures-vein-leaving-schoolgirl-needing-surgery.html Tongue piercing]&lt;/ref&gt; that had gained mainstream acceptance in the late 2000s were joined by more extreme modifications such as [[Stretching (body piercing)|stretched piercings]], [[flesh tunnel]]s, [[lip piercing]]s, and [[nose piercing]]s, despite the risk of hindering a teenager's career prospects.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/men/active/mens-health/10849816/Look-at-those-lugholes.html Look at those lugholes]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Facial hair===
In many western countries, the US, and Eastern Europe,&lt;ref&gt;[https://uk.news.yahoo.com/metrosexuals-gone-europe-agog-beards-081902643.html Beards in Poland]&lt;/ref&gt; the growing of a [[Beard|full beard]] became a popular trend amongst young males in the early-to-mid 2010s, with some suggesting this was due to the influence of the hipster subculture, the [[lumbersexual]] ideal, and the [[Movember]] campaign.&lt;ref&gt;http://m.scotsman.com/news/careless-whiskers-why-beards-are-back-in-fashion-1-3224369&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/apr/16/hipster-beard-guys-growing-a-beard&lt;/ref&gt; An increase in facial hair transplants was reported in the United Kingdom in the first three years of the decade,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-2582161/The-Ben-Affleck-effect-4-500-beard-transplants-carried-UK-men-cool-factor.html | location=London | work=Daily Mail | title=4,500 beard transplants carried out in UK as men up 'cool factor' | date=2014-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the trend approached what researchers predicted would be a 'peak' level of desirability.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2014/apr/16/fashion-conscious-men-warned-we-may-have-reached-peak-beard&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://metro.co.uk/2014/11/19/new-social-networking-site-match-makes-beards-with-those-who-love-stroking-them-4954175/ Social networking for beard lovers]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Electronic music parties/events/festivals are not new to Goa and much earlier pioneers of [[Free party|free party's/events/festivals]] with live DJ's mixing, art,craft's and food stalls started in the late 1980s and continued through all of the 1990s into the early 2000s where they played [[Goa trance]],  [[Psychedelic trance]], and [[Techno]] and were held at [[Vagator Beach Goa|Vagator Beach]], [[Anjuna|Anjuna beach]] and [[Arambol|Arambol beach]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[File:Steghose gold1.JPG|thumb|Stirrup pants designed as sportswear.]]
'''Stirrup pants''' (or stirrup leggings) are a of type close-fitting ladies' pant that tapers at the ankle, similar to leggings, except that the material extends to a band, or strap, that is worn under the arch of the foot to hold the pant leg in place. The band of material is often elasticized to prevent the material around the foot from tearing. Stirrup pants were originally sportswear for women, and remain sportswear for horse riding and skiing. However, they have come in and out of fashion during the 20th and early 21st centuries, peaking in popularity as street fashion during the 1980s.

==History==
Stirrup pants were first worn as breeches for horse riders. The purpose of the strap under the foot was to hold the pant legs in place in the boots of the rider. As ladies moved away from riding sidesaddle, they began wearing riding breeches in the 1920s in a similar style to those worn by men. By 1934, [[Jodhpurs]] as riding pants with foot straps were being advertised in the United States mail order catalogue for [[Sears]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Blum|first=Stella|title=Everyday Fashions of the Thirties As Pictured in Sears Catalogs|year=1986|publisher=Dover Publications|isbn=978-0-486-25108-0|pages=62}}&lt;/ref&gt; Horse riding  breeches are still made with an elastic foot strap in some designs. Stirrup pants for skiing were introduced at the [[1936 Winter Olympic Games]] in Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hewitt, Valerie; Ann Kellogg; and Lynn Payne|title=The Greenwood Encyclopedia of Clothing Through American History, 1900 to the Present: Volume 1, 1900-1949|year=2008|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-313-33395-8|pages=218}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stirrup stretch pants were a mainstay of ski wear for both men and women during most of the 1960s and part of the 1970s.  In the 1960s this style was used for women's and girls' stirrup pants. They were popular for several years as shown in clothing catalogs of the day, such as J.C. Penny, Sears, and Montgomery Ward.

Stirrup pants became a popular casual fashion for women in Europe and America from the mid-1980s to the early 1990s. In 1985, Linda Pender wrote in ''Cincinnati Magazine'' that stirrup pants were &quot;being touted as ''the'' wardrobe basic of the year, and ''every''body is buying them&quot;. On the one hand, the style was promoted as being &quot;easy to wear&quot; and giving &quot;most figures a long, lean line&quot;; on the other hand, a salesclerk pointed out to Pender that the style was not flattering unless the wearer was &quot;slim and fit&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Pender|first=Linda|title=Cruel Pants: The unkindest cut of all|newspaper=Cincinnati Magazine|date=October 1985|page=22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Leggings in general became fashionable streetwear during the 1980s, as did sweatshirts, leg warmers, and other items that originated in sports and dance studios.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Condra, Jill. Ed.|title=The Greenwood Encyclopedia of Clothing Through World History: Volume 3, 1801 to the Present|year=2007|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-313-33665-2|pages=202}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From about 2010 on, stirrup pants, stretch or not, have become just another style of pants for use by women and men for sports, running or general wear.

== Controversy ==
Demand for comfortable athletic wear increased in the early 2000s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Stalder|first1=Erika|title=Fashion 101: A Crash Course in Clothing|date=2008|publisher=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt|isbn=9780547946931|page=59}}&lt;/ref&gt; and into the next decade. [[Nike, Inc.]] reported their women’s business comprised 7 billion in 2010&lt;ref name =Denv/&gt; and the larger market grew to $33.6 billion by 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Will yoga pants have jean makers singing the blues?|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/will-yoga-pants-have-jean-makers-singing-the-blues/|website=CBS Money Watch|publisher=[[Associated Press]]|accessdate=22 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp;Nike claim the driving factor has been by the demand for fashionable workout gear that is also flattering. New colors, patterns, and structural design of yoga pants created more versatility and increased their wear in public settings. Author Mae Anderson described the new craze of yoga pants outside the gym by calling them the &quot;new jeans.&quot;&lt;ref name =Denv&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.denverpost.com/lifestyles/ci_24595974/how-yoga-pants-became-new-jeans|title = How yoga pants became the new jeans.|date = 25 November 2013|accessdate = 2 April 2015|website = Denver Post|publisher = The Denver Post|last = Anderson|first = Mae}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Yoga pants in public schools===
In the United States, reaction to the wider adoption of yoga pants proved somewhat controversial for schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Foley|first1=Heather|title=Your guide to America’s war on yoga pants|url=http://www.boston.com/lifestyle/fashion/2014/04/10/america-war-yoga-pants/C7cE8EIbZdjTLbMW9luL6H/story.html|work=Boston.com|date=10 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some schools adopted [[dress codes]] banning yoga pants for all students, or banning them only for female students.&lt;ref name=MA&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/regionals/north/2014/03/06/rockport-high-school-leggings-ban-controversy-still-simmers/bB6p4Q7AQeriyIACzAjlWJ/story.html|title = Rockport High School leggings-ban controversy still simmers|date = 6 March 2014|accessdate = 9 April 2015|website = The Boston Globe|publisher = |last = Shemkus|first = Sarah}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ND&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/distracting-yoga-pants-banned-officials-north-dakota-high-school-article-1.1962380|title = 'Distracting' yoga pants banned by officials at North Dakota high school|date = 3 October 2014|accessdate = 9 April 2015|website = Daily News|publisher = NY Daily News|last = Lestch|first = Corinne}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=IL&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/03/19/school-bans-leggings_n_4993941.html|title = Parents Say School's Leggings 'Ban' Is Unfair To Girls, 'Contributes To Rape Culture'|date = 19 March 2014|accessdate = 9 April 2015|website = Huffington Post|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Bitch Magazine]]'' argued such bans are largely gendered, focusing on the damage caused by &quot;distraction&quot; by girls;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Chin|first1=Elleanor|title=Instead of Banning Yoga Pants, Schools Should Crack Down on Harassment|url=http://bitchmagazine.org/post/instead-of-banning-yoga-pants-schools-should-crack-down-on-harassment|work=[[Bitch Magazine]]|date=15 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; similar complaints caused a ban in [[Rockport, Massachusetts]] to be quickly reversed.&lt;ref name=MA&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==== School bans ====
Girls from middle school to college wear yoga pants to classes because of their high level of comfort. However, not everyone is accepting of the new trend. In February 2015, representative David Moore from Montana proposed a bill that would make wearing yoga pants in public synonymous with indecent exposure, which would be punishable by a maximum of 5 years in jail and a $5,000 fine. Moore received immediate backlash from the public and media and he quickly claimed that including yoga pants in the bill was a joke. The bill was unanimously tabled. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://time.com/3705394/montana-yoga-pants-ban/|title = Montana Lawmaker Wants to Ban Yoga Pants|date = 11 February 2015|accessdate = 8 April 2015|website = Time|publisher = Time|last = Frizell|first = Sam}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At [[Rockport High School]] in [[Rockport, Massachusetts]], the principal announced that the school would be tightening the rules on yoga pants. Their dress code stated that students should avoid wearing clothes that are “inappropriate in the business and workplace as well as the school.” The principal is under scrutiny for not only the rule, but for how he addressed it. After an assembly including the whole student body, the principal dismissed only the male students and spoke solely to the female students about the dress code enforcement. He claimed that females wearing these tight-fitting pants were distracting the male students. The female students were offended and felt that the way they were singled out was sexist. The male students were also offended because they felt that it was implied that they lacked maturity, self-control, and consideration. After the instant backlash from students and parents, the school district quickly revoked its increased enforcement of dress code and apologized for how the assembly was handled.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/regionals/north/2014/03/06/rockport-high-school-leggings-ban-controversy-still-simmers/bB6p4Q7AQeriyIACzAjlWJ/story.html|title = Rockport High School leggings-ban controversy still simmers|date = 6 March 2014|accessdate = 9 April 2015|website = The Boston Globe|publisher = |last = Shemkus|first = Sarah}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At [[Devils Lake High School]] in North Dakota, the principal banned female students from wearing yoga pants. The ban was made in order to &quot;keep students, and male teachers, focused on the classwork at hand.&quot; Students and parents questioned why the school was focusing on clothing instead of more important matters, such as [[Cyber Bullying|cyber bullying]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/distracting-yoga-pants-banned-officials-north-dakota-high-school-article-1.1962380|title = 'Distracting' yoga pants banned by officials at North Dakota high school|date = 3 October 2014|accessdate = 9 April 2015|website = Daily News|publisher = NY Daily News|last = Lestch|first = Corinne}}&lt;/ref&gt; The principal was under scrutiny for a comment he made regarding the female students wearing yoga pants. The principal had the female students watch two clips from the movie ''[[Pretty Woman]]'', then compared yoga pants to the attire of the lead character in the movie, who is a prostitute. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.alternet.org/education/high-school-bans-dangerous-threat-male-students-yoga-pants|title = High School Bans Dangerous Threat to Male Students: Yoga Pants|date = 3 October 2014|accessdate = 9 April 2015|website = Alternet|publisher = |last = Kutner|first = Jenny}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another incident occurred at an [[Evanston, Illinois]] middle school. The principal announced that girls were no longer allowed to wear yoga pants to school. Parents argued that the dictating of what their daughters could wear contributes to [[rape culture]] and blames the girls as being a distractor to their opposite-sexed peers, which insinuates that boys' education is more important than girls'. When interviewed for their thoughts, one parent stated, &quot;Boys need to be taught to respect women no matter what they’re wearing, and that's a big deal.&quot; Another parent said, &quot;The problem is, yet again, another institution has decided it's easier to punish girls for what they wear because there is a chance someone of the opposite sex might sexualize them.&quot; The numerous policy and dress code changes that dictate what women can and cannot wear is a small portion of the bigger picture of gender policing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/03/19/school-bans-leggings_n_4993941.html|title = Parents Say School's Leggings 'Ban' Is Unfair To Girls, 'Contributes To Rape Culture'|date = 19 March 2014|accessdate = 9 April 2015|website = Huffington Post|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are others who agree with the banning of yoga pants in public. Most often the reasoning for disagreeing with wearing yoga pants publicly is that they promote a relaxed and informal atmosphere. Amanda Hallay, professor of fashion and cultural history at New York City’s [[LIM College]], was interviewed for her opinion on yoga pants being a replacement for jeans. She stated, “Yoga pants are a step above pajamas and we don't wear pajamas out to lunch, and we certainly don't wear them to work. Pajamas are for sleeping in, and ergo, not appropriate to wear in any other setting. The same can be said for yoga pants. Yoga pants are to be worn while doing yoga.&quot;Yoga pants being worn in public can be perceived as inappropriate and unattractive. According to Hallay, to promote a more business-like or mature persona, a person should dress as such.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = That's a 'no' to yoga pants; What we wear in public has to be about more than just our comfort.|last = Rhone|first = Nedra|date = 14 March 2015|journal = Atlanta Journal-Constitution|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Palazzo pants''' (British English = '''Palazzo trousers''') are long women's trousers cut with a loose, extremely wide leg that flares out from the waist.

Palazzo trousers are popular as a summer season style, as they are loose and tend to be flattering in light, flowing fabrics that are breathable in hot weather. [[Crape|Silk crepe/crape]], [[Jersey (fabric)|jersey]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Algeo|first=John|title=Fifty Years among the New Words: A Dictionary of Neologisms 1941-1991|year=1993|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-44971-7|pages=173}}&lt;/ref&gt; and other natural fibre textiles are popular fabrics for this design. Palazzo trousers are less frequently seen during the winter months, but they may be found in wool or heavy synthetic fabrics as well.

==History==
Palazzo pants for women first became a popular trend in the late 1960s and early 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Algeo|first=John|title=Fifty Years among the New Words: A Dictionary of Neologisms 1941-1991|year=1993|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-44971-7|pages=173}}&lt;/ref&gt; The style was reminiscent of the wide-legged cuffed trousers worn by some women fond of avant-garde fashions in the 1930s and 1940s, particularly actresses such as [[Katharine Hepburn]], [[Greta Garbo]] and [[Marlene Dietrich]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=LoAlbo|first=Stacy|title=Vintage Fashion Accessories|year=2009|publisher=Krause Publications|isbn=978-1-4402-0251-3|pages=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 1960s, some upscale restaurants resisted modern fashion trends by refusing to admit women wearing trousers, which were considered inappropriate by some proprietors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Smith|first=Nancy|title=Classic Ten|year=2003|publisher=Penguin Books|isbn=978-0-14-200356-5|pages=35}}&lt;/ref&gt; This posed a problem for women who did not want to wear the skirt styles that were then in fashion. Some women opted to circumvent restaurant bans on women in pants by wearing palazzo trousers or [[culottes]] as evening wear.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Heinemann|first=Barbara Perso|title=Fashioning an artful life: One woman's life history in clothes|year=2008|publisher=ProQuest Information and Learning Company|location=Ann Arbor | pages=166|isbn=978-0-549-40505-4|format=UMI Number: 3295487}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Palazzo pants flare out evenly from the waist to the ankle, and are therefore different from [[bellbottoms]], which are snug until they flare out from the knee.&lt;ref name=&quot;dervis&quot;&gt;Dervis,  [http://web.archive.org/web/20060409134729/http://www.madetomeasuremag.com/features/pre2003/953843329.html &quot;Bell Bottom Blues.&quot;] Made to Measure Magazine (Mar. 23, 2000).&lt;/ref&gt; Palazzo pants are also not to be confused with ''Gaucho trousers'', which only extend down to mid-calf length. [[Harem pants]] are yet another loose style, but they have a snug cuff around the ankles.&lt;ref name=inthe&gt;{{cite web|title=Clothes of the Eighties, Harem Pants|url=http://www.inthe80s.com/clothes/harempants0.shtml|publisher=inthe80s.com|accessdate=6 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Black peplum shirt.jpg|thumb|A woman wearing a shirt with an overskirt, or peplum, bottom hem]]
An '''overskirt''', or '''peplum''', is a type of elongated hem resembling a short [[skirt]], worn to lie over another garment, either another skirt such as a [[petticoat]] or underskirt, or [[breeches]]. 

Overskirts may serve various purposes, ranging from protecting the underlying clothing from mud and dirt, to being purely a decorative feature. Overskirts have been popular as a clothing detail for both men and women during various periods of history. More recently, they are associated with women's jackets and blouses, included in closely fitted clothing, where they accentuate a narrow waist, or light materials to create a casual sense of elegance.

Overskirts first came into fashion during the [[Victorian Era]] in 1867, after the pre-hoop and hoop periods of multiple petticoats and crinoline, and before the bustle period. A reduction in overall shirt size was seen at this time. Fashion in ladies dresses changed from the wide, very lacy skirts, to a more conical shape that diminished at the hips. Early skirts were often looped up for walking, showing a pretty petticoat underneath, which led to the introduction of the overskirt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://trulyvictorian.com/history/1855.html |title=History Pre-Hoop |publisher=Trulyvictorian.com |date= |accessdate=2014-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There have been many predecessors to the fashionable overskirt, such as bibs and aprons used to protect clothing underneath. Today, overskirts can be a separate article worn over shorts or another dress, or a continuation on a shirt or jacket of longer or pleated material. Popular modern overskirt fashion are sheer materials, tulle, and lace patterns that allow see through to garments beneath such as half-skirts.

The term &quot;peplum&quot; originates with the ancient Greek [[peplos]], a women's garment that had the same decorative detail as an overskirt.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''High-low skirts''', also known as [[asymmetrical]], [[waterfall]], or mullet skirts, are skirts with a hem that is higher in the front, or side, than in the back.

==History==
[[File:Hi lo skirt.jpg|thumb|An example of a high-low skirt]]

The high-low skirt has a full circle hem. However, the length varies from short in front to long in back. The style originates in [[Victorian era]] dresses and formal gowns, when the hem style became known as the &quot;[[fishtail skirt|fishtail]]&quot;. During the 19th century, it became a trend in the mid-1870s, reappearing in the early 1880s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Brooke|first=Iris|title=A history of English costume|year=1979|publisher=Eyre Methuen|pages=149}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and later in women's formal gowns and evening dresses throughout the 20th century, particularly in the late 1920s and early 1930s, where lowering hemlines were a mask that would start off 1930s silhouettes.

The recent high-low skirt hem trend began in late 2011. The high-low skirt became a trend in Europe and America in late 2011, eventually becoming a worldwide fashion in Spring and Summer 2012. It has received fashion press coverage in India, such as in the fashion labels [[Namrata Joshipura]] and [[Myoho]], being praised for its &quot;playfulness&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Zakaria|first=Namrata|title=A Summer of Content|url=http://www.expressindia.com/latest-news/a-summer-of-content/935295/|publisher=Express India|accessdate=April 11, 2012|date=April 11, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It received widespread visibility outside of fashion circles after [[The Voice (U.S.)|The Voice]] contestant [[Devyn DeLoera]] wore a peach-coloured high-low skirt for her audition in summer 2012.

The skirt style has been given a variety of names by designers and the press, including asymmetrical and waterfall, with the most derisive term being &quot;[[mullet skirt]]&quot;, used by Britain's [[Daily Mirror|Mirror]] newspaper in criticising a version worn by singer [[Cher Lloyd]] in April 2012,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Wheeler|first=Rachael|title=Cher Lloyd shows off her Bridget Jones pants in a short (and entirely invisible) skirt on stage|url=http://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/celebrity-news/cher-lloyd-suffers--wardrobe-784955|accessdate=April 11, 2012|newspaper=Mirror|date=April 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; a mocking reference to the now unfashionable mullet hairstyle that was a brief men's [[fad]] in the 1980s. However, some high-low dress wearers have embraced the term, referring to their own dress as a mullet dress.

==Asymmetric peplum trend==
A related trend in 2011 and 2012 is the asymmetric [[peplos|peplum]] hem on shirts, sweaters and jackets for women. The peplum, a broad ruffled hem that is fitted at the waist and flares outward, has been a recurring fashion trend in Europe for centuries, and was last popular in Europe and North America during the 1940s and 1950s. An asymmetric version has been brought to women's fashion in 2012, but not all consumers find it flattering, with one American stating, &quot;I do not believe it hides large hips and behinds, and the new asymmetrical peplums should only be worn by the tall and thin&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Hill|first=Karen Nazor|title=Retro peplum jackets back in style for women this season|url=http://timesfreepress.com/news/2012/mar/26/retro-peplum-jackets-back-in-style-for-women/|accessdate=April 11, 2012|newspaper=Chattanooga Times Free Press|date=March 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Handkerchief skirts''' are skirts with asymmetric hems, created from fabric panels of different lengths sewn together, to create a hem with several  corners that hang down as points. The hem resembles a [[handkerchief]] that is held by the centre so that its corners hang down as points.

[[File:Handkerchief hem 2.jpg|thumb|A handkerchief hem skirt.]]

==History==
Handkerchief hems have been used in women's tops and skirt hems for centuries in many cultures, to add a flattering drape, especially over the hips. They can be seen in women's clothing in art from Ancient Greece, and appeared in Parisian fashions in the 1910s-1920s, such as the dresses of designer [[Madeleine Vionnet]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kirke|first=Betty|title=Madeleine Vionnet|year=1998|publisher=Chronicle Books|pages=18}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jean Patou]] followed Vionnet's lead, using the handkerchief hem to transition hemlines away from the shorter [[Flapper]] styles he had helped popularize, and towards the longer lengths that were fashionable during the 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Brockman|first=Helen|title=The Theory of Fashion Design,|year=1965|publisher=John Wiley and Sons|location=New York|isbn=0471105864|pages=40–52}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the simplest design, a square of fabric is cut with an opening in the middle for the waistband. When the skirt is put on, the four corners hang down as points. More panels of material can be used to increase the number of corners, or points, along the hem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=McKelvey|first=Kathryn|title=Fashion Source Book|year=2006|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=9781405126939|pages=204}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Revival==
In the first decade of the 21st century, handkerchief hems returned as a trend in women's clothing. Since the design involves pleats that drape, the effect is achieved with lightweight, flowing fabrics. In 2003, the trend was evident in [[bohemian styles]] such as designs by American clothing label [[Free People]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Good Housekeeping|year=2003|volume=236|pages=230|publisher=Hearst Corp.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, handkerchief hems were modelled at Milan fashion shows.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=JET|date=29 November 2004|volume=106|issue=22|pages=17|publisher=Johnson Publishing|issn=0021-5996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''strapless dress''' or top is a garment that stays put around the upper body without [[shoulder strap]]s or other visible means of support. It is usually supported by an internal [[corset]] and/or [[brassiere]], with the tightness of the bodice preventing the dress from slipping out of position.&lt;ref name=met&gt;{{cite book|last=Martin|first=Richard|title=Bare witness|year=1996|publisher=Metropolitan Museum of Art|location=New York|isbn=9780870998027|pages=6|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=PmuEqgZPdeUC&amp;pg=PA6#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|author2=Koda, Harold }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1930s to 1980s===
According to [[Richard Martin (curator)|Richard Martin]] and Harold Koda, the modern strapless dress first appeared in the 1930s, where it was popularised by designers such as [[Mainbocher]], and, from the late 1940s, [[Christian Dior]].&lt;ref name=met/&gt; The July 18, 1938 issue of ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' claimed that the 'absolutely strapless, sleeveless evening dress' was a 1937/38 invention.&lt;ref name=life&gt;{{cite journal|title=Underthings for the Strapless Vogue|journal=LIFE|date=18 July 1938|pages=33|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=nU8EAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA33#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=18 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, that was predated in 1932 by the actress [[Libby Holman]], who had been photographed in an apparently strapless dress that year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Former actress questioned in husband's death|url=http://www.loc.gov/pictures/item/95504786/|accessdate=22 March 2013|newspaper=New York World-Telegram|date=9 July 1932}}&lt;/ref&gt; Holman became associated with the strapless dress and is regularly credited with inventing it,&lt;ref&gt;Scheper, Jeanne.

During the 1940s and 1950s, Catholic campaigners in the United States protested against &quot;immodest&quot; clothing, including [[Bikini|two-piece]] and strapless swimsuits and dresses.&lt;ref name=jay&gt;{{cite book|last=Jay|first=Kathryn|title=&quot;In Vogue with Mary&quot; - How Catholic Girls Created an Urban Market for Modesty; published in Faith in the market : religion and the rise of urban commercial culture|year=2002|publisher=Rutgers University Press|location=New Brunswick, N.J.|isbn=9780813530994 |pages=177–198 |url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=niIAHkP89JgC&amp;pg=PA177#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |author2=Winston, Diane |editor=John M.

During the 1950s, notable strapless dress designers included [[Grès|Madame Grès]], whose flowing Grecian dresses were mounted upon custom-designed interior corsets by [[Alice Cadolle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Polan|first=Brenda|title=The Great Fashion Designers.|year=2009|publisher=Berg|location=Oxford|isbn=9781847882271|pages=69|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=H5oadQtleT4C&amp;pg=PA69#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|edition=English|author2=Tredre, Roger }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1970s [[Halston]] designed an unstructured strapless dress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Polan|first=Brenda|title=The Great Fashion Designers.|year=2009|publisher=Berg|location=Oxford|isbn=9781847882271|pages=139|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=H5oadQtleT4C&amp;pg=PA139&amp;dq=#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|edition=English|author2=Tredre, Roger }}&lt;/ref&gt; The knitted [[tube top]] was worn as a casual strapless option,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Peterson|first=Amy T.|title=Greenwood Encyclopedia of Clothing through American History , 1900 to the Present|year=2008|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=0313043345|pages=209|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=rQCEF-tG77AC&amp;pg=RA1-PA209#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|author2=Ann Kellogg }}&lt;/ref&gt; and by the 1980s, strapless dresses were made in stretchy, elastic fabrics which did not require boning or interior structure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Steele|first=edited by Valerie|title=The Berg companion to fashion|year=2010|publisher=Berg|location=Oxford|isbn=9781847885920|pages=266|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Hemsvn9ZbRkC&amp;pg=PA266#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1990s onwards===
[[File:Himeji-Oshiro-Matsuri 2010 087.JPG|thumb|200px|Japanese bride wearing a strapless dress, 2010]]
In 2012 the strapless dress was described as the most widely requested style for Western wedding dresses.&lt;ref name=maggie&gt;{{cite book |last=Daniels |first=Maggie |title=Wedding Planning and Management |year=2012 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=9781136349140 |url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=i6bVaaeNopEC&amp;pg=PT256&amp;dq#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|author2=Carol Loveless }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Vera Wang]] is sometimes credited with introducing this style of bridal dress in the first decade of the 21st century,&lt;ref name=maggie/&gt; although strapless dresses were an increasingly valid option from the 1990s onwards with the growing popularity of formal [[civil wedding]]s from the 1990s.&lt;ref name=clancy&gt;{{cite book|last=Steer|first=Deirdre Clancy|title=The 1980s and 1990s|year=2009|publisher=Chelsea House|location=New York|isbn=9781604133868|pages=47–48|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=cgU5OQuHTRcC&amp;pg=PA47&amp;dq#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=woram&gt;{{cite book|last=Woram|first=Catherine|title=Wedding dress style : the indispensable style-file for brides-to-be and designers |year=1993 |publisher=Apple |location=London |isbn=9781850764632 |url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=wtDfAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=strapless#search_anchor}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, for religious weddings, strapless and shoulder-baring styles are potentially controversial,&lt;ref name=clancy/&gt; and despite the popularity of the strapless wedding dress it is considered by some to be a &quot;rejection of the virginal ideal&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kohl|first=Martha|title=I do : a cultural history of Montana weddings |year=2011 |publisher=Montana Historical Society Press |location=Helena |isbn=9780980129229 |pages=74 |url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Lq2HGZvRcrgC&amp;pg=PA74&amp;dq#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The strapless dress is also a very popular style for [[red carpet fashion]].&lt;ref name=hal/&gt;

==Social and cultural context==
Since their introduction, strapless garments have proved problematic in many contexts. In the early 21st century, many schools and workplaces specifically forbid strapless garments as part of their [[dress code]]. An [[Adecco]] survey published in ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' in 2012 indicated that 72% of Americans thought strapless tops were inappropriate office wear.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Kom|first=Melissa|title=What Not to Wear To Work|url=http://blogs.wsj.com/atwork/2012/07/20/work-wear-101-what-not-to-wear-to-work/|accessdate=18 March 2013|newspaper=The Wall Street Journal|date=20 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Religious stances===
Strapless garments may be singled out for particular censure by preachers and clerics. In 2005, a Muslim cleric declared strapless garments &quot;satanic&quot;, along with other revealing garments such as [[miniskirt]]s and [[see-through clothing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Devine|first=Miranda|title=Muslim cleric: women incite men's lust with 'satanic dress'|url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/National/Muslim-cleric-women-incite-mens-lust-with-satanic-dress/2005/04/23/1114152362381.html|accessdate=18 March 2013|newspaper=The Sun-Herald|date=24 April 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Spencer W. Kimball]], the 12th [[President of the Church#President of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints|President]] of the [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS church), declared that strapless gowns were neither righteous nor approved, and that no Latter-day Saint woman should wear one at any time,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kimball|first=Spencer W.|title=The Teachings of Spencer W.

'''Goa''' {{IPAc-en|audio=Goa.ogg|ˈ|ɡ|oʊ|.|ə}}  is a state located in the South western region of India; it is bounded by the state of [[Maharashtra]] to the north, and by [[Karnataka]] to the east and south, while the [[Arabian Sea]] forms its western coast. It is [[India]]'s smallest [[states and territories of India|state]] by area and the [[List of states and territories of India by population|fourth smallest by population]].  Goa is one of India's richest states with a GDP per capita two and a half times that of the country as a whole.&lt;ref name=&quot;report&quot; /&gt; It was ranked the best placed state by the Eleventh Finance Commission for its infrastructure and ranked on top for the best quality of life in India by the National Commission on Population based on the 12 Indicators.&lt;ref name=&quot;report&quot;&gt;{{cite book|others=India.

[[Panaji]] is the state's capital, while [[Vasco da Gama, Goa|Vasco da Gama]] is the largest city. The historic city of [[Margao]] still exhibits the cultural influence of the [[Portugal|Portuguese]], who first landed in the early 16th century as merchants and conquered it soon thereafter. Goa is a former Portuguese province; the Portuguese overseas territory of [[Portuguese India]] existed for about 450 years until it was [[1961 Indian annexation of Goa|annexed]] by India in 1961.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://gpp.nic.in/Liberation.html|title=Liberation of Goa |accessdate=17 July 2007 |publisher=Government Polytechnic, Panaji }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bharat-rakshak.com/IAF/History/1960s/Goa01.html |title=The Liberation of Goa: an Overview |accessdate=17 July 2007 |last=Pillarisetti |first=Jagan |work=The Liberation of Goa:1961 |publisher=bharat-rakshak.com |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070809202539/http://www.bharat-rakshak.com:80/IAF/History/1960s/Goa01.html |archivedate=9 August 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Goa is visited by large numbers of international and domestic tourists each year for its beaches, places of worship and [[Old Goa|world heritage architecture]]. It also has rich [[flora]] and [[fauna]], owing to its location on the [[Western Ghats]] range, which is classified as a [[biodiversity hotspot]].

==Etymology==
In ancient literature, Goa was known by many names, such as ''[[Gomanta Kingdom|Gomanta]]'', ''Gomanchala'', ''Gopakapattam'', ''Gopakapuri'', ''Govapuri'', ''Govem'', and ''Gomantak''.&lt;ref name=&quot;nic1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.india.gov.in/knowindia/st_goa.php |title=Goa |publisher=[[National Informatics Centre|National Informatics Centre(NIC)]] |accessdate=4 January 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20081218193633/http://india.gov.in:80/knowindia/st_goa.php |archivedate=18 December 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Indian epic ''[[Mahabharata]]'' refers to the area now known as Goa as ''Goparashtra'' or ''Govarashtra,'' which means &quot;a nation of cowherds&quot;. ''Gopakapuri'' or ''Gopakapattanam'' were used in some ancient [[Sanskrit]] texts, and these names were also mentioned in other sacred [[Hindu]] texts such as the ''[[Harivansa]]'' and the ''[[Skanda Purana]]''. In the 3rd century BC, Goa was known as ''Aparantha'' and is mentioned by the Greek geographer [[Ptolemy]]. In the 13th century, the Greeks referred to Goa as ''Nelkinda''. Other historical names for Goa are ''Sindapur'', ''Sandabur'', and ''Mahassapatam''.&lt;ref name=&quot;sakname&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Sakshena|2003|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=7kUE7TV3ZWEC&amp;pg=PA5&amp;dq=goa+silharas&amp;lr=#v=onepage&amp;q=goa%20silharas&amp;f=false 5]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Early Goan society underwent radical changes when [[Indo-Aryan peoples|Indo-Aryan]] and [[Dravidian people|Dravidian]] migrants amalgamated with the aboriginal locals, forming the base of early Goan culture.&lt;ref name=dhume2&gt;{{cite book|last=Dhume|first=Anant Ramkrishna|title=The cultural history of Goa from 10000 BC - 1352 AD|year=1986|publisher=Ramesh Anant S.

In the 3rd century BC, Goa was part of the [[Maurya Empire]], ruled by the Buddhist emperor, [[Ashoka]] of [[Magadha]]. Buddhist monks laid the foundation of [[Buddhism]] in Goa. Between the 2nd century BC and the 6th century AD, Goa was ruled by the [[Bhojas of Goa]]. [[Chutu]]s of [[Karwar]] also ruled some parts as feudatories of the [[Satavahana]]s of [[Kolhapur]] (2nd century BC to the 2nd century AD), [[Western Kshatrapas]] (around 150 AD), the [[Abhira]]s of Western [[Maharashtra]], Bhojas of the [[Yadav caste|Yadav]] clans of [[Gujarat]], and the Konkan Mauryas as feudatories of the [[Kalachuri]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|De Souza|1990|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=dwYDPnEjTb4C&amp;pg=PA9&amp;dq=bhojas+goa&amp;lr=#v=onepage&amp;q=bhojas%20goa&amp;f=false 9]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rule later passed to the Chalukyas of [[Badami]], who controlled it between 578 to 753, and later the [[Rashtrakuta]]s of [[Malkhed]] from 753 to 963. From 765 to 1015, the Southern [[Silhara]]s of [[Konkan]] ruled Goa as the feudatories of the Chalukyas and the Rashtrakutas.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|De Souza|1990|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=dwYDPnEjTb4C&amp;pg=PA10&amp;dq=bhojas+goa&amp;lr=#v=onepage&amp;q=bhojas%20goa&amp;f=false 10]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over the next few centuries, Goa was successively ruled by the [[Kadamba Dynasty|Kadamba]]s as the feudatories of the [[Western Chalukya Empire|Chalukyas of Kalyani]]. They patronised [[Jainism]] in Goa.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|De Souza|1990|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=dwYDPnEjTb4C&amp;pg=PA11&amp;dq=bhojas+goa&amp;lr=#v=onepage&amp;q=bhojas%20goa&amp;f=false 11]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1312, Goa came under the governance of the [[Delhi Sultanate]]. The kingdom's grip on the region was weak, and by 1370 it was forced to surrender it to [[Harihara I]] of the [[Vijayanagara empire]]. The Vijayanagara monarchs held on to the territory until 1469, when it was appropriated by the [[Bahmani Sultanate|Bahmani sultans]] of [[Gulbarga]]. After that dynasty crumbled, the area fell into the hands of the [[Adil Shahi]]s of [[Bijapur Sultanate|Bijapur]], who established as their auxiliary capital the city known under the [[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese]] as [[Velha Goa]].&lt;ref name=dobbie&gt;{{cite book|last=Dobbie|first=Aline|title=India: The Elephant's Blessing|year=2006|publisher=Melrose Press|pages=253 pages (see page 220)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Lesser coat of arms of Portuguese India.svg|thumb|upright|Coat of Arms of Goa as a Portuguese enclave 1935–1961.]]
In 1510, the [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] defeated the ruling Bijapur sultan Yousuf Adil Shah with the help of a local ally, [[Timayya]]. They set up a permanent settlement in Velha Goa (or Old Goa). This was the beginning of Portuguese rule in Goa that would last for four and a half centuries, until 1961.

In 1843 the Portuguese moved the capital to [[Panjim]] from [[Velha Goa]]. By the mid-18th century, Portuguese Goa had expanded to most of the present-day state limits. Simultaneously the Portuguese lost other possessions in India until their borders stabilised and formed the [[Portuguese India|Estado da Índia Portuguesa]] or ''State of Portuguese India'', of which Goa was the largest territory.

After India gained independence from the British in 1947, India requested that Portuguese territories on the Indian subcontinent be ceded to India. Portugal refused to negotiate on the sovereignty of its Indian enclaves. On 19 December 1961, the [[Indian Army]] began military operations with [[1961 Indian annexation of Goa|Operation Vijay]] resulting in the annexation of Goa, [[Daman and Diu|Daman, and Diu]] into the Indian union. Goa, along with Daman and Diu, was organized as a centrally administered [[union territory]] of India. On 30 May 1987, the union territory was split, and Goa was made India's twenty-fifth state, with Daman and Diu remaining a union territory.

==Geography and climate==

===Geography===
[[File:Goa (44).jpg|thumb|Goa coastline at Dona Paula]]
Goa encompasses an area of {{convert|3,702|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}. It lies between the latitudes 14°53′54″ N and 15°40′00″ N and longitudes 73°40′33″ E and 74°20′13″ E. Most of Goa is a part of the coastal country known as the [[Konkan]], which is an escarpment rising up to the [[Western Ghats]] range of mountains, which separate it from the [[Deccan Plateau]]. The highest point is the [[Sonsogor]], with an altitude of {{convert|1,167|m|ft}}. Goa has a coastline of {{convert|101|km|mi|abbr=on}}.

Goa's main rivers are [[Mandovi River|Mandovi]], [[Zuari River|Zuari]], [[Terekhol River|Terekhol]], [[Chapora River|Chapora]] kushavati river and the [[Sal River (India)|Sal]]. The Mormugao harbour on the mouth of the River Zuari is one of the best natural harbours in [[South Asia]]. The Zuari and the Mandovi are the lifelines of Goa, with their tributaries draining 69% of its geographic area. These rivers are some of the busiest rivers in India. Goa has more than forty estuarine, eight marine and about ninety riverine islands. The total navigable length of Goa's rivers is {{convert|253|km|mi|abbr=on}}. Goa has more than three hundred ancient [[Irrigation tank|tanks]] built during the rule of the Kadamba dynasty and over a hundred medicinal springs.

Most of Goa's soil cover is made up of [[laterite]]s rich in [[ferric]] [[aluminium]] oxides and reddish in colour. Further inland and along the riverbanks, the soil is mostly [[alluvial]] and [[loam]]y. The soil is rich in minerals and [[humus]], thus conducive to agriculture. Some of the oldest rocks in the [[Indian subcontinent]] are found in Goa between [[Molem]] and [[Anmod]] on Goa's border with Karnataka. The rocks are classified as [[Gneiss|Trondjemeitic Gneiss]] estimated to be 3,600 million years old, dated by [[rubidium]] [[Radiometric dating|isotope dating]]. A specimen of the rock is exhibited in the [[Goa University]].

===Climate===
[[File:Dudhsagar Falls Triplet.jpg|thumb|200 px|Dudhsagar Falls on the Goa-Karnataka border.]]
Goa features a [[tropical monsoon climate]] under the [[Köppen climate classification]]. Goa, being in the tropical zone and near the [[Arabian Sea]], has a hot and [[humidity|humid]] climate for most of the year. The month of May is the hottest, seeing day temperatures of over {{convert|35|°C|°F|abbr=on}} coupled with high humidity. The [[monsoon]] rains arrive by early June and provide a much needed respite from the heat. Most of Goa's annual rainfall is received through the monsoons which last till late September.

Goa has a short winter season between mid-December and February. These months are marked by nights of around {{convert|21|°C|°F|abbr=on}} and days of around {{convert|28|°C|°F|abbr=on}} with moderate amounts of humidity. Further inland, due to altitudinal gradation, the nights are a few degrees cooler.

==Subdivisions==
[[File:Administrative map of Goa.png|thumb|upright|Talukas of Goa. Talukas in green shades belong to [[North Goa]] district, and orange denote [[South Goa]] district.]]
{{Main|Districts of Goa}}

The state is divided into two [[List of Indian districts|districts]]: [[North Goa]] and [[South Goa]]. Each district is governed by a [[district collector]], an administrator appointed by the Indian government.

[[Panaji]] is the headquarters of North Goa district and is also the capital of Goa.

North Goa is further divided into four subdivisions&amp;nbsp;– [[Panaji]], [[Bicholim]], [[Mapusa]] and [[Ponda, Goa|Ponda]]; and six [[taluk]]s&amp;nbsp;– [[Tiswadi]] ([[Panaji]]), [[Bardez]] ([[Mapusa]]), [[Pernem]], [[Bicholim]], [[Sattari]] ([[Valpoi]]), and [[Ponda taluk|Ponda]].

[[Margao]] is the headquarters of South Goa district.

South Goa is further divided into three subdivisions&amp;nbsp;– [[Margao]], [[Mormugao]] ([[Vasco da Gama, Goa|Vasco da Gama]]), and [[Quepem]]; and six [[taluk]]s&amp;nbsp;– [[Mormugao]], [[Salcete]] ([[Margao]]), [[Quepem]], [[Canacona]] ([[Chaudi]]), [[Sanguem]], and [[Dharbandora]].

Goa's major cities include [[Vasco da Gama, Goa|Vasco da Gama]], [[Margao]], [[Panaji]], [[Mapusa]] and [[Ponda, Goa|Ponda]].

[[Panaji]] is the only Municipal Corporation in Goa.

There are thirteen Municipal Councils: [[Margao]], [[Mormugao]] (including [[Vasco da Gama, Goa|Vasco da Gama]]), [[Pernem]], [[Mapusa]], [[Bicholim]], [[Sanquelim]], [[Valpoi]], [[Ponda, Goa|Ponda]], [[Cuncolim]], [[Quepem]], [[Curchorem]], [[Sanguem]], and [[Canacona]].

==Government and politics==
{{Main|Government of Goa}}
[[File:India Goa Assembly.jpg|thumb|300px|Goa Assembly]]
In the [[Parliament of India]], Goa has two seats in the [[Lok Sabha]], one representing each district, and one seat in the [[Rajya Sabha]].

Goa's administrative capital is [[Panaji]], known as Panjim in English, as Pangim in Portuguese, and as Ponnje in the local language.  Panaji lies on the left bank of the Mandovi river. Goa's legislative assembly building is located in [[Porvorim]]&amp;nbsp;– the seat of the [[Goa assembly]], which lies across the Mandovi from Panaji. The state's judicial hierarchy relates to [[Mumbai]] (formerly known as Bombay, which is the capital of Goa's neighbouring Maharashtra state), as the state comes under the [[Bombay High Court]]. A bench of the High Court is present in Panaji. Unlike other states, which follow the British Indian model of civil laws framed for individual religions, the Portuguese [[Uniform Civil Code]], based on the [[Napoleonic code]], has been retained by the Goa government.

Goa has a [[unicameral]] legislature consisting of a forty-member [[Goa assembly|Legislative Assembly]], headed by a [[Chief Minister]] who wields the [[Executive (government)|executive power]]. The ruling government consists of the party or coalition garnering the most number of seats in the state elections and enjoying the support of a [[majority|simple majority]] of the House. The Governor is appointed by the [[President of India]]. The Governor's role is largely ceremonial, but is crucial when it comes to deciding who should form the next government or in suspending the legislature as has happened in the recent past. After having stable governance for nearly thirty years up to 1990, Goa is now notorious for its political instability having seen fourteen governments in the span of the fifteen years between 1990 and 2005.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hindu.com/2005/01/31/stories/2005013104051100.htm Odds stacked against Parrikar], Anil Sastry, ''[[The Hindu]]'', 31 January 2005, verified 2 April 2005&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2005 the assembly was dissolved by the Governor and [[President's Rule]] was declared, which suspended the legislature. A [[by-election]] in June 2005 saw the Indian National Congress coming back to power after winning three of the five seats that went to polls. The [[Indian National Congress|Congress party]] and the [[Bharatiya Janata Party]] (BJP) are the two largest parties in the state. In the assembly poll of 2007, the INC-led coalition won and started ruling the state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= Sanjay|last=Banerjee |title=Congress set to rule Goa again. |url= http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/articleshow/2101667.cms |work=indiatimes.com |publisher= Times Internet Limited |date= 6 June 2007|accessdate=5 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the recent 2012 Vidhan Sabha Elections, the [[Bharatiya Janata Party]] along with the [[Maharashtrawadi Gomantak Party]] won a clear majority, forming the new government with Manohar Parrikar as the Chief Minister. Other parties include the [[United Goans Democratic Party]], the [[Nationalist Congress Party]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://northgoa.nic.in/ |title=North Goa District website |publisher=northgoa.nic.in |accessdate=16 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Flora and fauna==
{{Main|Flora and fauna of Goa}}
Equatorial forest cover in Goa stands at {{convert|1424|km2|sqmi|2|abbr=on}},&lt;ref name=&quot;nic1&quot; /&gt; most of which is owned by the government. Government owned forest is estimated at {{convert|1224.38|km2|sqmi|2|abbr=on}} whilst private is given as {{convert|200|km2|sqmi|2|abbr=on}}. Most of the forests in the state are located in the interior eastern regions of the state. The [[Western Ghats]], which form most of eastern Goa, have been internationally recognised as one of the biodiversity hotspots of the world. In the February 1999 issue of ''[[National Geographic Magazine]]'', Goa was compared with the [[Amazon Basin|Amazon]] and [[Congo Basin|Congo]] basins for its rich tropical biodiversity{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}.

Goa's wildlife sanctuaries boast of more than 1512 documented species of plants, over 275 species of birds, over 48 kinds of animals and over 60 genera of reptiles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.goahub.com/wildlife-sanctuaries-in-goa/index.html|title=Wildlife Sanctuaries in Goa|accessdate=18 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Rice]] is the main food crop with [[Pulse (legume)|pulses]], [[Finger millet|ragi]] and other food crops are also grown. Main cash crops are [[coconut]]s, [[cashewnut]]s, [[arecanut]]s, [[sugarcane]] and fruits like [[pineapple]]s, [[mango]]s and [[banana]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;nic1&quot; /&gt; The State has a rich forest cover of more than 1,424&amp;nbsp;km². Goa's state animal is the [[Gaur]], the state bird is the Ruby Throated Yellow Bulbul, which is a variation of [[Black-crested Bulbul]], and the state tree is the [[Terminalia tomentosa|Asan]].[[File:Goa Fields.JPG|thumb|[[Paddy field|Rice paddies]] are common in rural Goa.]] The important forests products are [[bamboo]] canes, [[Maratha]] barks, chillar barks and the [[bhirand]]. [[Coconut trees]] are ubiquitous and are present in almost all areas of Goa barring the elevated regions. A large number of [[deciduous]] trees, such as [[teak]], [[Sal tree|sal]], [[cashew]] and [[mango]] trees are present. Fruits include [[jackfruit]]s, [[mango]]s, [[pineapple]]s and 'black-berry' ('podkoam' in [[Konkani language|konkani]]). Goa's forests are rich with medicinal plants.

[[Fox]]es, [[wild boar]]s and [[bird migration|migrating]] birds are found in the jungles of Goa. The [[Bird|avifauna]] includes [[kingfisher]]s, [[myna]]s and [[parrot]]s. Numerous types of fish are also caught off the coast of Goa and in its rivers. [[Crab]]s, [[lobster]]s, [[shrimp]]s, [[jellyfish]], [[oysters]] and [[catfish]] are the basis of the marine fishery. Goa also has a high [[snake]] population, which keeps the [[rodent]] population under control. Goa has many famous [[National Parks]], including the renowned [[Salim Ali]] bird sanctuary. Other wildlife sanctuaries include the [[Bondla Wildlife Sanctuary]], [[Molem Wildlife Sanctuary]], [[Cotigao Wildlife Sanctuary]], [[Madei Wildlife Sanctuary]], [[Netravali Wildlife Sanctuary]], [[Mahaveer Wildlife Sanctuary]] and the [[Salim Ali Bird Sanctuary]] located on the island of [[Chorao]].

Goa has more than 33% of its geographic area under government forests (1224.38&amp;nbsp;km²) of which about 62% has been brought under Protected Areas (PA) of Wildlife Sanctuaries and National Park. Since there is a substantial area under private forests and a large tract under cashew, mango, coconut, etc. plantations, the total forest and tree cover constitutes 56.6% of the geographic area.

Goa's gross [[State Domestic Product|state domestic product]] for 2007 is estimated at $3 billion in current prices. Goa is one of India's richest states with the highest [[GDP per capita]]&amp;nbsp;— two and a half times that of the country as a whole&amp;nbsp;— and one of its fastest growth rates: 8.23% (yearly average 1990–2000).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Mohan |first=Vibhor |url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/Chandigarhs_per_capita_income_highest_in_India/articleshow/3487128.cms |title=Chandigarh's per capita income is highest in India |publisher=The Times of India |date=16 September 2008 |accessdate=16 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Tourism is Goa's primary industry: it handles 12%&lt;ref&gt;[http://goenkar.com/book/print/112 Economy of Goa], from [http://goenkar.com/ goenkar.com] verified 2 April 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; of all foreign tourist arrivals in India. Goa has two main tourist seasons: winter and summer. In the winter time, tourists from abroad (mainly Europe) come to Goa to enjoy the climate. In the summer time (which, in Goa, is the rainy season), tourists from across India come to spend the holidays.

The land away from the coast is rich in minerals and ores, and [[mining]] forms the second largest industry. Mining in Goa focuses on ores of [[iron ore|iron]], [[bauxite]], [[manganese]], clays, [[limestone]] and [[silica]]. The [[Marmagao]] Port handled 31.69 million tonnes of cargo last year, and accounts for over 39% of India's iron ore exports. The leaders in the Goan iron ore industry include [[Sesa Goa]] (now owned by [[Vedanta Resources]]) and Dempo.
Rampant mining in areas rich in iron ore and other minerals is now threatening the forest cover as well as posing a health hazard to the local population. Mining corporations are also indulging in illegal mining in some areas without proper permits.
Agriculture, while of shrinking importance to the economy over the past four decades, offers part-time employment to a sizeable portion of the populace. [[Rice]] is the main agricultural crop, followed by [[areca]], [[cashew]] and [[coconut]]. The fishing industry provides employment for about forty thousand people, though recent official figures indicate a decline of the importance of this sector and also a fall in catch, perhaps coupled with the fact that traditional fishing has given way to large-scale mechanised trawling.

Medium scale industries include the manufacturing of [[pesticide]]s, [[fertiliser]]s, [[tire|tyres]], tubes, [[footwear]], [[chemical]]s, [[pharmaceutical]]s, [[wheat]] products, steel rolling, fruits and fish canning, cashew nuts, textiles, [[brewery]] products.
The Goa government has recently decided to not allow any more [[Special Economic Zone|special economic zones]] (SEZs) in Goa. This is in stark contrast to policy followed by other states of India. SEZs are known to bring tax revenues for the government and employment option for local citizens since industries flock there for lower tax rates as compared to other areas. Currently there are 16 planned SEZs in Goa. This decision was taken by state government after strong opposition to SEZs by political parties and Goa Catholic Church.&lt;ref name=goasez&gt;{{cite news

| accessdate =13 November 2007 | work=The Times Of India| date=13 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Goa is also notable for its low beer, wine and spirits prices due to its very low [[excise|excise duty]] on [[alcohol]]. Another source of cash inflow into the state comes from many of its citizens who work abroad and remit money to their families.

The Goa, Daman and Diu Official Language Act, 1987 makes [[Konkani language|Konkani]] in the [[Devanagari]] script the sole official language of Goa, but provides that [[Marathi language|Marathi]] may also be used &quot;for all or any of the official purposes&quot;. [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] was the sole official language during [[Portuguese India|Portuguese colonial rule]]. It is now, however, mostly spoken by only the elderly Portuguese-educated populations and is no longer an official language. The Government also has a policy of replying in Marathi to correspondence received in Marathi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Commissioner Linguistic Minorities |title=42nd report: July 2003&amp;nbsp;– June 2004 |page=para 11.3 |url=http://nclm.nic.in/shared/linkimages/35.htm | accessdate =6 June 2007 |ref=harv |postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071008113359/http://nclm.nic.in/shared/linkimages/35.htm |archivedate = 8 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whilst there have been demands for according [[Konkani in the Roman script]] official status in the state, there is widespread support for keeping Konkani as the sole official language of Goa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.navhindtimes.com/story.php?story=2008083147| title=Solving the Language Imbroglio |publisher=[[Navhind Times]]|accessdate=15 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Goa has two [[World Heritage Sites]]: the [[Bom Jesus Basilica]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://goajesuits.in/bomjesus |title=Basilica of Bom Jesus, Old Goa &amp;#124; Parish Ministry &amp;#124; Goa Jesuits |publisher=www.goajesuits.in |accessdate=18 July 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20110721155553/http://goajesuits.in/bomjesus |archivedate=21 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
and [[Old Goa|churches and convents of Old Goa]]. The Basilica holds the mortal remains of [[St. Francis Xavier]], regarded by many Catholics as the [[patron saint]] of Goa (the patron of the [[Archdiocese of Goa]] is actually Saint [[Joseph Vaz]]). The relics are taken down for veneration and for public viewing, as per the prerogative of the Church in Goa, not every ten or twelve years as popularly thought and propagated. The last exposition was held in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-30160195 |title=Pilgrims flock to Goa to see Saint Francis Xavier remains |publisher=www.bbc.co.uk |accessdate=22 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Fontainhas (quarter)|Fontainhas]] in Panaji has been declared a cultural quarter, showcasing the life, architecture and culture of Goa. Some influences from the Portuguese era are visible in some of Goa's temples, notably the [[Shanta Durga Temple]], the [[Mangueshi Temple]] and the [[Mahalasa]] Temple, although after 1961, many of these were demolished and reconstructed in the indigenous Indian style.

===Food===
[[File:Goan Fish Curry.jpg|thumb|Goan Fish Curry]]
Rice with fish [[curry]] (''xit koddi'' in [[Konkani language|Konkani]]) is the staple diet in Goa. [[Goan cuisine]] is famous for its rich variety of fish dishes cooked with elaborate recipes. [[Coconut]] and [[coconut oil]] are widely used in Goan cooking along with [[chili pepper]]s, [[spice]]s, and [[vinegar]] is used in the Catholic cuisine, giving the food a unique flavour.

Goan food may be divided into Goan Catholic and Goan Hindu cuisine with each showing very distinct tastes, characteristics, and cooking styles. [[Pork]] dishes such as [[Vindaloo]], [[Xacuti]], [[chouriço]], and [[Sorpotel]] are cooked for major occasions among the [[Goan Catholics]]. An exotic Goan vegetable stew, known as [[Khatkhate]], is a very popular dish during the celebrations of festivals, Hindu and Christian alike. Khatkhate contains at least five vegetables, fresh coconut, and special Goan spices that add to the aroma.

[[Sanna (rice cakes)|Sannas]], ''Hitt'', are variants of [[idli]] and ''Polle'', ''Amboli'', and ''Kailoleo'' are variants of [[dosa]]; all are native to Goa. A rich [[egg (food)|egg]]-based, multi-layered sweet dish known as [[bebinca]] is a favourite at Christmas.

There are some places in Goa which are famous for Goa's traditional &amp; special cousines.

The most popular alcoholic beverage in Goa is [[Feni (liquor)|feni]]; cashew feni is made from the fermentation of the fruit of the cashew tree, while coconut feni is made from the sap of toddy palms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Rise of Cashew Feni|url=http://goastreets.com/goa-news/the-heady-rise-of-cashew-feni/|work=goastreets.com|publisher=Goa Streets|accessdate=2 June 2013|author=Joseph Zuzarte|date=14 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Goa also has a rich wine culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A Date With Port|url=http://www.verveonline.com/110/life/scapes-wine.shtml|work=verveonline.com|publisher=[[Verve (magazine)|Verve]]|accessdate=2 June 2013|author=Sheetal Wadhwa Munshaw| date=July 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Wine and dine in Goa|url=http://www.thewineclub.in/special_feature/1211/wine-and-dine-in-Goa|work=thewineclub.in|publisher=The Wine Club|accessdate=2 June 2013|author=Ashiqa Salvan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The architecture of Goa is a combination of [[Indian architecture|Indian]], [[Islamic architecture|Islamic]] and [[Portuguese architecture|Portuguese]] styles. Since the Portuguese ruled for four centuries, many churches and houses bear a striking element of the Portuguese style of architecture. Goan Hindu houses do not show any Portuguese influence, though the modern temple architecture is an amalgam of original Goan temple style with [[Dravidian architecture|Dravidian]], [[Hemadpanthi]], Islamic, and Portuguese architecture.&lt;ref name=tempgoa&gt;{{cite book|last=Mankekar|first=Kamla|title=Temples of Goa|year=2004|publisher=Publications Division, Ministry of Information and Broadcasting, Govt. of India,|isbn=&lt;!--81-230-1161-X, --&gt;9788123011615|pages=99 pages(see pages 1–17)}}&lt;/ref&gt; The original Goan temple architecture fell into disuse as the temples were demolished by the Portuguese and the ''[[Sthapati]]'' known as ''Thavayi'' in Konkani were converted to Christianity though the wooden work and the ''Kavi'' murals can still be seen.&lt;ref name=kavi&gt;{{cite book|last=Kamat|first=Krishnanand|title=Konkanyali Kavikala|publisher=Goa Konkani Akademi|location=Panaji}}&lt;/ref&gt; (see:Goa:Hindu temples and deities by Rui Gomes Periera).

Goa has its own [[Goa football team|state football team]] and league, the [[Goa Professional League]]. It is probably the only state in India where cricket is not considered the most important of all sports.

Goa also has its own [[Goa cricket team|cricket team]].

== Education ==
{{main|Education in Goa}}
{{See also|List of institutions of higher education in Goa}}

Goa had India's earliest educational institutions built with European support. The Portuguese set up seminaries for religious education and parish schools for elementary education. Founded circa 1542 by saint Francis Xavier, [[Saint Paul's College, Goa]] was a Jesuit school in Old Goa, which later became a college. St Paul's was once the main Jesuit institution in the whole of Asia. It housed the first printing press in India and published the first books in 1556. 

Medical education began in 1801 with the offering of regular medical courses at the Royal and Military Hospital in the old City of Goa. Built in 1842 as the Escola Médico-Cirúrgica de (Nova) Goa (Medical-Surgical School of Goa), [[Goa Medical College]] is one of Asia's oldest medical colleges and has one of the oldest medical libraries (since 1845).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = MEDICALEDUCATION CELL-GMC- BAMBOLIM GOA.|url = http://www.gmcmec.gov.in/|website = www.gmcmec.gov.in|accessdate = 2015-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; It houses the largest hospital in Goa and continues to provide medical training to this day.

According to the 2011 census, Goa has a [[literacy rate]] of 87%, with 90% of males and 84% of females being literate.&lt;ref name = &quot;LitRate&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://educationforallinindia.com/page157.html |title= District-specific Literates and Literacy Rates, 2001|accessdate=18 July 2007 |publisher= Education for all in India }}&lt;/ref&gt; Each taluka is made up of villages, each having a school run by the government. Private schools are preferred over government run schools. All schools come under the [[Goa Board of Secondary &amp; Higher Secondary Education]], whose syllabus is prescribed by the state education department. There are also a few schools that subscribe to the all-India [[Indian Certificate of Secondary Education|ICSE]] syllabus or the [[National Institute of Open Schooling|NIOS]] syllabus. Most students in Goa complete their high school with English as the medium of instruction. Most primary schools, however, use Konkani and Marathi (in private, but government-aided schools). As is the case in most of India, enrolment for vernacular media has seen a fall in numbers in favour of English medium education. As per a report published in ''[[The Times of India]]'', 84% of Goan primary schools run without an administrative head.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/Cities/84-Goa-schools-without-heads/articleshow/4363801.cms|title=No Administrative head |accessdate=6 April 2009 |publisher=Times of India |first1=Gauree |last1=Malkarnekar |date=6 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:GoaUniversity.jpg|thumb|[[Goa University]]]]

After ten years of schooling, students join a Higher Secondary school, which offers courses in popular streams such as [[Science]], [[Liberal Arts|Arts]], [[Law]] and [[Commerce]]. A student may also opt for a course in vocational studies. Additionally, they may join three-year [[diploma]] courses. Two years of college is followed by a [[professional degree]] programme. [[Goa University]], the sole [[university]] in Goa, is located in [[Taleigão]] and most Goan colleges are affiliated to it.

There are six [[engineering]] colleges in the state.

==Transportation==

===Air===
[[File:Dabolim Airport 1.jpg|thumb|Aircraft at Dabolim Airport]]
[[Goa International Airport]], is a [[civil enclave]] at [[INS Hansa]], a Naval airfield located at [[Dabolim]] near [[Vasco da Gama]]. The airport caters to scheduled domestic and international air services. Goa has scheduled international connections to [[Doha]], [[Dubai]], [[Muscat, Oman|Muscat]], [[Sharjah (city)|Sharjah]] and [[Kuwait]] in the [[Middle East]] by airlines like [[Air Arabia]], [[Air India]], [[GoAir]], [[Indigo]], [[Oman Air]], [[SpiceJet]], [[Jet Airways]], JetKonnect and [[Qatar Airways]].

===Road===
[[File:Welcome to Tivim Goa.jpg|thumb|Most of Goa is well connected by roads.]]
[[File:Kadamba Tata Marcopolo Starbus Ultra Ac Deluxe.jpg|thumb|Government-run Kadamba buses at a bus station in Goa]]

Goa's [[public transport]] largely consists of privately operated buses linking the major towns to rural areas. Government-run buses, maintained by the [[Kadamba Transport Corporation]], link major routes (like the Panjim–Margao route) and some remote parts of the state. The Corporation owns 15 bus stands, 4 depots and one Central workshop at Porvorim and a Head Office at Porvorim.&lt;ref name=&quot;ES&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.goa.gov.in/pdf/goa-esurvey-2010-2011.pdf|title=Economic Survey 2011-2012 |publisher=Government of Goa |accessdate= 21 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In large towns such as Panjim and Margao, intra-city buses operate. However, public transport in Goa is less developed, and residents depend heavily on their own transportation, usually motorised two-wheelers and small family cars.

[[File:Goa Pilot Vehicle.JPG|200px|thumb|Motorcycle Taxi or &quot;Pilots&quot;]]
Goa has four [[National Highway (India)|National Highway]]s passing through it. NH-66 (ex [[National Highway 17 (India)(old numbering)|NH-17]]) runs along India's west coast and links Goa to [[Mumbai]] in the north and [[Mangalore]] to the south. [[National Highway 4A (India)|NH-4A]] running across the state connects the capital Panjim to [[Belgaum]] in east, linking Goa to cities in the [[Deccan]]. The NH-366 (ex [[National Highway 17A (India)|NH-17A]]) connects NH-66 to [[Mormugao]] Port from Cortalim. The new NH-566 (ex NH-17B) is a four-lane highway connecting Mormugao Port to NH-66 at Verna via [[Dabolim Airport]], primarily built to ease pressure on the NH-366 for traffic to Dabolim Airport and Vasco da Gama. NH-768 (ex NH-4A) links Panjim and Ponda to Belgaum and NH-4. Goa has a total of {{convert|224|km|mi|abbr=on|0}} of national highways, {{Convert|232|km|mi|abbr=on|0}} of state highway and 815&amp;nbsp;km of district highway. National Highways in Goa are among the narrowest in the country and will remain so for the foreseeable future, as the state government has received an exemption that allows narrow national highways. In Kerala, highways are 45 meters wide. In other states National Highways are grade separated highways 60 meters wide with a minimum of four lanes, as well as 6 or 8 lane access-controlled expressways.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.digitalgoa.com/ca_disp.php?id=1428 Goa, Goa Breaking News].

Hired forms of transport include unmetered taxis and, in urban areas, [[auto rickshaws]]. Another form of transportation in Goa is the [[motorcycle taxi]], operated by drivers who are locally called &quot;pilots&quot;. These vehicles transport a single [[pillion|pillion rider]], at fares that are usually negotiated. Other than buses, &quot;pilots&quot; tend to be the cheapest mode of transport.&lt;ref name=&quot;Abram2004&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Dave|first=|title=The Rough Guide to Goa 5|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GGZRtj4OnccC&amp;pg=PA35|accessdate=16 December 2012|edition=5|date=1 January 2004|publisher=Rough Guides|isbn=978-1-84353-081-7|page=35}}&lt;/ref&gt; River crossings in Goa are serviced by flat-bottomed [[ferry|ferry boats]], operated by the river navigation department.

===Rail===
[[File:Margao railwaystation.JPG|thumb|Margao railway station]]
Goa has two [[Rail transport|rail lines]]—one run by the South Western Railway and the other by the [[Konkan Railway]]. The line run by the [[South Western Railway]] was built during the colonial era linking the port town of [[Vasco da Gama, Goa]] with [[Belgaum]], [[Hubli]], [[Karnataka]] via [[Margao]]. The Konkan Railway line, which was built during the 1990s, runs parallel to the coast connecting major cities on the western coast.

===Sea===
The Mormugao harbour near the city of Vasco handles mineral ore, petroleum, coal, and international containers. Much of the shipments consist of minerals and ores from Goa's hinterland. Panjim, which is on the banks of the Mandovi, has a minor port, which used to handle passenger [[Steamboat|steamers]] between Goa and Mumbai till the late 1980s. There was also a short-lived catamaran service linking Mumbai and Panaji operated by Damania Shipping in the 1990s.

'''India''' is a country with an ancient clothing design tradition, yet an emerging [[fashion industry]]. Though a handful of designers existed prior to the 1980s, the late 80s and the 1990s saw a spurt of growth. This was the result of increasing exposure to global fashion and the economic boom after the [[economic liberalisation in India|economic liberalisation]] of the [[Indian economy]] in 1990. The following decades firmly established fashion as an the industry, across India.

==History==

===Post-independence: Ethnic revival and Bollywood fashion===
[[File:Bollywood Fashion Awards, 2006.jpg|thumb|200px|Post-independence focus on revival of traditional textile and design lead to the rise of &quot;ethnic chic&quot;.]]
History of [[clothing in India]], dates back of ancient times, yet fashion in a new [[industry]], as it was the [[Fashion in india#Traditional clothing|traditional Indian clothings]] with regional variations, be it [[sari]], [[ghagra choli]] or [[dhoti]], that remained popular till early decades of [[Independence of India|post-independence]] India.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tierney2013&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Tom Tierney|title=Fashions from India|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=hdOsQadR9_cC|page=3|year= 2013|publisher=Courier Dover Publications|isbn=978-0-486-43040-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; A common form of the Indian fashion originates from the Western culture. Fashion includes a series of sequins and gold thread to attract customers and apply a statement to the Indian fashion community. A famous [[Indian fashion]] trademark is [[embroidery]], a art of sewing distinct thread patterns. A way to include the traditional look and create a new fashion statement includes embroidery applied to different dresses, skirts, shirts, and pants to reflect the western culture influence as well as include the [[Indian tradition]]. As a part of larger  revival movement in the Indian textile industry, [[Ritu Kumar]], a Kolkata-based designer and textile print-expert started working on reviving the traditional [[Textile printing#Hand block printing|hand block printing]] techniques of Bengal, and making it a part of the fashion industry, established &quot;ethnic chic&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;BrewardGilbert2006&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author1=Christopher Breward|author2=David Gilbert|title=Fashion's World Cities|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=UTgN_68QaWgC&amp;pg=PA220|year=2006|publisher=Berg|isbn=978-1-84520-413-6|pages=220–}}&lt;/ref&gt; She opened her first boutique in Delhi in 1966. In 1973, she first showcased the [[Zardozi]] [[embroidery]] in her garments, which had its origins in the royal costumes dating back to the [[Mughal era]]. This led to the revival of this lost art. In time [[Embroidery of India|embroidery]] became prominent feature of [[Indian wedding]] attires, and also one of the biggest fashion exports.&lt;ref name=li551/&gt;&lt;ref name=htfashion&gt;{{Cite news| title = Indian fashion's greatest hits|author=[[Yashica Dutt]]| url = http://www.hindustantimes.com/Brunch/Brunch-Stories/Indian-fashion-s-greatest-hits/Article1-1098677.aspx | publisher = Hindustan Times, Brunch | date = July 26, 2013  | accessdate = 28 July 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This was period of revival, where various organisations, NGOs and indicuals were involved in reviving traditional Indian techniques, in weaving, printing, dyeing or embroidery, including ''[[ikat]]'', ''[[Patola Saree|patola]]'' (double-ikat), ''[[bandhani]]'' (tie &amp; dye) and ''[[Shisha (embroidery)|shisha]]'' (mirror embroidery).&lt;ref name=li551/&gt;

An early trendsetter in fashion was [[Bollywood]] ([[Hindi cinema]]), where costume designers like [[Bhanu Athaiya]], started experimenting with film fashion in the 1960s. Athaiya started working on period costumes in ''[[Sahib Bibi Aur Ghulam]]'' (1962) and ''[[Amrapali (film)|Amrapali]]'' (1966), though went on to introduce varied trends through ''[[Teesri Manzil]]'' (1966), ''[[Chalte Chalte (1976 film)|Chalte Chalte]]'' (1976), ''[[Karz (film)|Karz]]'' (1980) and ''[[Chandni]]'' (1989). These were soon followed by the mass market. Also situations and themes in Indian cinema became westernised making way for the display of diverse fashion. Over the years, popular Bollywood trends have been the  [[Madhubala]]'s  [[Anarkali]]-look with kurtas and churidars in ''[[Mughal-e-Azam]]'' (1960), purple embroidered sari worn by [[Madhuri Dixit]] in ''[[Hum Aapke Hain Koun...!]]'' (1994), to [[Rani Mukherji]]'s short kurti-suits in  ''[[Bunty Aur Babli]]'' (2005), ''[[Veer Zaara]]'' suits and blouses from ''[[Parineeta (2005 film)|Parineeta]]''. This comes besides various fashion interpretation of the sari in films like ''[[Chandni]]''  (1989) with [[Sridevi]], ''[[Main Hoon Naa]]'' (2004) with [[Sushmita Sen]] and ''[[Dostana (2008 film)|Dostana]]'' (2008) with [[Priyanka Chopra]], which became fashion trends.&lt;ref name=today/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;eco&quot;&gt;{{Cite web | title = Bollywood: The fashion guru | url = http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/features/brand-ambassadors/bollywood-the-fashion-guru/articleshow/2220220.cms | publisher = The Economic Times  | date =4 Jul 2007| accessdate = 28 July 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1980s and fashion boom===
By the early 1980s, the first generation of Indian fashion designers started cropping up, including [[Satya Paul]]. However, it was [[Rohit Khosla]] (1958–1994), who became a pioneer in fashion industry, when we founded co-founded Ensemble&quot; in 1987, with [[Tarun Tahiliani]], Abu Jani-Sandeep Khosla and others. Though, the &quot;Anarkali-style&quot; has been around ever since, it was first popularised after ''[[Mughal-e-Azam]]'' (1969), it was Abu Jani-[[Sandeep Khosla]], who inspired by costumes of Mughal courtesans and [[Meena Kumari]]'s costumes in ''[[Pakeezah]]'' (1975), introduced the floor-length ''Anarkali''-style of ''[[churidaar]]-[[kurta]]'' in 1988, which soon became the Indian version of the [[ball gown]].&lt;ref name=htfashion/&gt; In 1986, [[Ministry of Textiles (India)|Ministry of Textiles]], [[Government of India]] opened the [[National Institute of Fashion Technology]] (NIFT) in Delhi with the help of the [[Fashion Institute of Technology]], New York. It played an important role in bringing in locally trained fashion designers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nytimes.com/1989/06/21/style/new-fashion-school-in-india-draws-from-a-rich-heritage.html New Fashion School in India Draws From a Rich Heritage], by Barbara Crossette, ''[[New York Times]]'', June 21, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt; By 2010, it had developed 15 branches across India, and smaller private fashion institutions had also developed.&lt;ref name=li553&gt;[[#Li|Linda, p. 553]]&lt;/ref&gt; Also in 1987, [[Tarun Tahiliani]] and his wife Shailja 'Sal' Tahiliani, founded &quot;Ensemble&quot;, India’s first multi-designer boutique in Mumbai.&lt;ref name=tele10&gt;{{cite web |author=Chitra Papnai| title = Lord of the ramp|publisher=The Telegraph  | url = http://www.telegraphindia.com/1101114/jsp/graphiti/story_13169495.jsp|date=November 14, 2010| accessdate = 2014-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = The Couple Who Took Fashion Off The Street |publisher= Business Standard

==Punjabi suit==
The term Punjabi suit refers to the three piece ensemble comprising the head scarf, kameez and the salwar. However, the term also encompasses the older variety of the Punjabi suthan suit which is made up of the head scard, kurta/kurti and Punjabi suthan.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated5&quot;&gt;Sidhu Brard, Gurnam Singh  (2007) East of Indus: My Memories of Old Punjab [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=UUdYFH9skIkC&amp;pg=PA331&amp;dq=punjab+sutthan&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=M4-aVaWkFceuU5zwmZAD&amp;ved=0CCQQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=punjab%20sutthan&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Etymology====
The word suthan is derived from the [[Sanskrit]] word svasthana,&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated2&quot;/&gt; which means tight fitting trousers which in turn is derived from the Central Asian word Samstamni.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated3&quot;&gt;Archaeological Congress and Seminar Papers: Papers Presented at the 4th Annual Congress of the Indian Archaeological Society and the Seminars Held at Nagpur on the 10th, 11th, and 12th Nov. 1970, Volume 4, Part 1970 [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=_xJuAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=svasthana+trousers&amp;dq=svasthana+trousers&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=nwSFVfuFBseOU76WqIgL&amp;ved=0CFoQ6AEwCTgK]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Subbarayappa, B.

The salwar ends in a band which is loose fitting. Despite this difference, people use the word suthan and salwar interchangeably to describe loose suthans and salwars,&lt;ref&gt;John, A (2009) Two dialects one region: A sociolinguistic approach to dialects as identity markers.&lt;/ref&gt; with the loose suthan resembling the salwar.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=yCRuAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=sutthan+punjab&amp;dq=sutthan+punjab&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=64uaVYOKNMf4UuDPjng&amp;ved=0CC8Q6AEwBDgK Dhavalikar, Madhukar Keshav  (2003) Archaeology of western India]&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to the use of the term pajama, the term suthan was used. Therefore, the woollen pajamas of Gilgit&lt;ref&gt;Knight, E.F.

The suthan can also be arranged in plaits.&lt;ref&gt;Wace, E.G. (1874) Report on the land revenue settlement of the Hazara District of the Punjab : 1868 - 1874 [https://books.google.co.uk/books?ei=UPeUVeT9MMi9UbX_i4AJ&amp;id=bMPTuskHAqUC&amp;dq=hazara+kurta&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=ending+above]&lt;/ref&gt; Up to 20 yards of cloth can be used which hangs in innumerable folds.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=s-Y2AQAAMAAJ&amp;q=punjab++suthan&amp;dq=punjab++suthan&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=cYFnVarhJ8mS7AaE6oPYCQ&amp;ved=0CCQQ6AEwAQ Punjab District Gazetteers (1932)]&lt;/ref&gt; Some varieties, such as those of [[Chakwal]], can use between 30 and 40 yards of cloth which are made with overhanging pleats.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=eOtAAQAAMAAJ&amp;q=sutthan+punjabi&amp;dq=sutthan+punjabi&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=4eSaVY_JLsSP7Aa15byAAw&amp;ved=0CEkQ6AEwCQ Punjab District Gazetteers 1907 Jhelum District ..]&lt;/ref&gt;

The material used for the suthan is traditionally coloured cotton with silk lines going down and is called sussi.&lt;ref&gt;Punjab District Gazetteer: Reprint of Ludhiana District and Malerkotla State Gazetteer, 1904 [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=E-c2AQAAMAAJ&amp;q=punjabi+suthan&amp;dq=punjabi+suthan&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=aXJsVfeSEsqM7Aa06IGQCA&amp;ved=0CE8Q6AEwBzgK]&lt;/ref&gt; Sussi was manufactured in various places such as [[Hoshiarpur]], [[Amritsar]], [[Multan]] and [[Jhang]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=dXoiAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=jhang+district+salwar&amp;dq=jhang+district+salwar&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Vf2LVcbUKsPqUrfngdAO&amp;ved=0CDsQ6AEwAg Gauba, Anand (1988) Amritsar, a study in urban history, 1840-1947]&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of loose material is a local development. The pleats of the suthan either gather in circles resembling bangles, or fall vertically to the ankles.

=====Variations=====
Sometimes women replaced the suthan with a churidar pajamma, (a tradition noted by Baden-Powell in 1872 in his book Hand-book of the Manufactures and Arts of the Punjab)&lt;ref&gt;Baden-Powell, Baden. Henry (1872) Hand-book of the Manufactures and Arts of the Punjab [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=HnAIAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA105&amp;dq=kurta+punjab+new&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=m0VwVeLWLsv1ULWMgPgO&amp;ved=0CEYQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=kurta%20punjab%20new&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt; which would then be covered with a [[Punjabi Ghagra]] when going outdoors. The [[Punjabi ghagra]] has its origins in the candataka which continued as a popular female dress in the seventh century.&lt;ref&gt;Uma Prasad Thapliyal (1978) Foreign elements in ancient Indian society, 2nd century BC to 7th century AD [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=9X4BAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=candataka+dress&amp;dq=candataka+dress&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=MGqGVbOqNoGyU_HYgfAM&amp;ved=0CFoQ6AEwCQ]&lt;/ref&gt; The use of the svasthana was also popular in this period. However, the candataka ended at the thighs and the svasthana may have been used to cover the lower legs thus giving rise to the tradition of wearing the ghagra and the suthan together.

Older Punjabi women wore churidar pajamma and long kurta. These different styles were popular during the 1960s in [[Punjab, India|East Punjab]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Mohinder Singh Randhawa 1960&quot;&gt;Mohinder Singh Randhawa. (1960) Punjab: Itihas, Kala, Sahit, te Sabiachar aad.Bhasha Vibhag, Punjab, Patiala.&lt;/ref&gt;

Certain members of the Punjabi community however, were wearing the suthan and kurti on its own without the [[Punjabi Ghagra]], a tradition documented in the Gazetter of Hoshiarpur District 1883-84&lt;ref&gt;Gazetteer of the Hoshiarpur District: 1883-84.

Although the use of the Suthan subsequently spread to the [[Jammu Division|Jammu]] area of the [[Punjab region]],&lt;ref name=&quot;books.google.co.uk&quot;/&gt; [[Sindh]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?ei=PGBxVeXsAsvkUpzTgsgF&amp;id=ql87AAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=sindhi+never+wore++suthan&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=paro S. P. Chablānī Economic conditions in Sind, 1592 to 1843 (1951)]&lt;/ref&gt; (where it was not traditionally worn) and [[Kashmir]], in the plains of the [[Punjab region]], the suthan was replaced with the Punjabi version of the salwar and the Punjabi kameez which gained more and more popularity during the 1960s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mohinder Singh Randhawa 1960&quot;/&gt;

====Punjabi suthan suit revival====
In recent years, the Punjabi suthan suit has been revived. However, the pleats fall in a variet of ways and the ankle band is not as tight as the traditional Punjabi suthan.

===Punjabi salwar suit===
[[File:Saraiki Tehreek.JPG|thumb|Saraiki region of Punjab, Pakistan]]
====Punjabi salwar====
In its strictest sense, the salwar is baggy and loose straight down the legs, and gathered loosely at the ankles. During the medieval period, people adopted the Iraqi style of salwar in [[Multan]] and neighbouring [[Sindh]].&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;&gt;Kumar, Raj (2008) Encyclopaedia of Untouchables Ancient, Medieval and Modern [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=e8o5HyC0-FUC&amp;pg=PA239&amp;dq=sindh+kurta+dress+medieval+times&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=o9OKVYimMYjlUdWJhKgG&amp;ved=0CDkQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=sindh%20kurta%20dress%20medieval%20times&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=6xMNAAAAIAAJ&amp;q=salwar+iraq+sindh+makran&amp;dq=salwar+iraq+sindh+makran&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Th6OVe6fMdDY7AbjvoTgAQ&amp;ved=0CDMQ6AEwAQ Said,Hakim Mohammad  (1990) Road to Pakistan. 1. 712 - 1858]&lt;/ref&gt; This type of salwar is traditionally very baggy and gathered at the ankles. It is still worn by the Kurdish community in [[Iraq]]. The presence of the baggy salwar was noted by Alberuni in the 11th century A.D.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;/&gt; and continued to be envogue between the 16th and 18th centuries C.E. in [[Multan]]&lt;ref&gt;Dasti, Humaira Faiz  (1998) Multan, a province of the Mughal Empire, 1525-1751 [https://books.google.co.uk/books?ei=RLWLVf_yBMmjU7D4g5gH&amp;id=kH3jAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=multan+shalwar&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=+shalwar]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Multani salwar is similar to the loose Punjabi suthan. Therefore, the distinction between the loose Punjabi suthan and the loose Multani salwar is fine and centres on the tight ankle band in the suthan, and on the suthan beginning to fit closer to the legs below the knees.

The original Punjabi loose salwar was not as baggy as the Multani style but was wide, with the gathering at the ankles being wide enough to cover the feet. Originally, up to ten yards of cloth was used to make Punjabi salwars.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=UdP_sSKIxf0C&amp;pg=PA243&amp;dq=salwar+punjab++afghan&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=nsSLVaeaOMnvUtvpuOgF&amp;ved=0CFgQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&amp;q=salwar%20punjab%20%20afghan&amp;f=false Yarwood, Doreen (2011) Illustrated Encyclopedia of World Costume]&lt;/ref&gt;  The original Punjabi salwar was also not as baggy as other forms of the salwar, such as the type worn in [[Afghanistan]] ([[Khet partug|partug]])), the Balochi salwar,&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?ei=NUyOVZPdHMGd7AbqkoPYDw&amp;id=P8JFAQAAIAAJ&amp;dq=bahawalpur+shalwar&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=discarded Punjab district gazetteers, Volume 7, Part 1 (1923)]&lt;/ref&gt; or the loose Punjabi suthan, and gathers more quickly below the knees and ends in a tight band. Eventually the modern Punjabi salwar came into being which is slim fitting and does not have wide ends as before.

Another style of salwar is the Pothohari salwar of the [[Pothohar]] area of the [[Punjab region]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Mohinder Singh Randhawa 1960&quot;/&gt; The Pothohari salwar retains the wideness of the Punjabi suthan. The kameez is also wide. The chunni is a remnant of the large [[Chador|chadar]] popular in [[Punjab, Pakistan|West Punjab]] known as salari&lt;ref&gt;Kehal, Harkesh Singh (2011) Alop ho riha Punjabi virsa Lokgeet Parkashan ISBN 978-93-5017-532-3&lt;/ref&gt; and the large [[Phulkari]] worn in various areas of the [[Punjab region]]. However, the Pothohari salwar suit did not attain universal acceptance. The Bahawalpuri salwar is also wide and baggy&lt;ref&gt;Current Opinion, Volume 25 (1899) [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=28RCAQAAMAAJ&amp;dq=bahawalpur+wide+trouser&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=wide+trousers]&lt;/ref&gt; with many folds.

The [[Punjabi people|Punjabi]] salwar Suit is worn in the Punjab in [[India]] and [[Pakistan]]. It consists of the chunni (head scarf), jhagga(kameez) and the salwar when worn by women. The chunni can be of varying lengths. The jhagga (kameez) is made up of two rectangular pieces sewn together with side slits, similar to a [[tunic]]. A kurta is also worn.

The salwar is similar to pajamas or pants, wide at the top and tightened loosely around the ankles with hard material, called paunchay. In the Punjab, the salwar kameez is also known as the chunni jhagga salwar suit.

===Early History===

====Salwar====
Salwar is the generic term used to describe the lower garment developed in different regions. The earliest form of the salwar originated in [[Central Asia]] amongst the [[Turkic peoples|Turks]] and its use was spread to [[Afghanistan]], [[India]], [[Iran]], the [[Arab]] world,  [[Turkey]] and wherever the [[Turkic peoples|Turks]] established their empires.&lt;ref&gt;Jirousek, Charlotte. “Islamic Clothing.” In Encyclopedia of Islam. New York: Macmillan Pub. 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Ottomans]] spread the use of the salwar  throughout its empire.&lt;ref&gt;Annette Lynch, Mitchell D. Strauss (2014) Ethnic Dress in the United States: A Cultural Encyclopedia [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=tiEvBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA142&amp;dq=chalvar&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CDwQ6AEwBTgeahUKEwjDubCPyOzGAhXIsxQKHR20Dt4#v=onepage&amp;q=chalvar&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of the salwar in the [[Punjab region]] has been the result of influences from the Middle East, Central Asian Turks&lt;ref&gt;Martin, Richard C.  (2004) Encyclopedia of Islam and the Muslim World: A-L, Volume 1  [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=OVcUAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=sirwal+central+asia&amp;dq=sirwal+central+asia&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=QCCgVeuuCsTB7ga635_gBg&amp;ved=0CB8Q6AEwADgK]&lt;/ref&gt; and finally, the Afghans.

In India, the term salwar includes the [[Sindhi dress|Sindhi suthan]], [[Punjab]]i suthan,&lt;ref&gt;Dr Singh, Daljit (2004) Punjab Socio-Economic Condition (1501-1700 A.D.) [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=6-jZAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=punjab+kurta+suthan&amp;dq=punjab+kurta+suthan&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=pn1nVaGAGLOM7AaB8YOQBQ&amp;ved=0CF4Q6AEwCA]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jammu dress|Dogri pajamma]] and the [[churidar]]. The term salwar kameez also includes the Kashmiri [[Phiran|Phiran/suthan outfit]].

In the [[Punjab region]], the salwar was made using a large amount of material but had no pleats or folds. The large salwar eventually gave rise to the Punjabi salwar.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated2&quot;&gt;Paintings and Lifestyles of Jammu Region: From 17th to 19th Century A.D Raj Kumar [http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=f-1XyQ2eIG8C&amp;pg=PA352&amp;lpg=PA352&amp;dq=Paintings+and+Lifestyles+of+Jammu+Region:+From+17th+to+19th+Century+A.D.&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=8nBHQb20ox&amp;sig=hehEhqbYaQ_NVTmqKdoksvPYpcY&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=xQt3VPu1Ms6V7AbByYHwBQ&amp;ved=0CCMQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=punjab&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Jhagga (kameez)====
In Turkic Central Asian culture, the salwar is accompanied by a tunic, forming the upper garment.&lt;ref&gt;Aryan, K.C (1983) The Cultural Heritage of Punjab, 3000 B.C. to 1947 A.D.

The [[Ghaznavid]] Turks popularised the salwar/tunic attire in Afghanistan and Northern India,&lt;ref&gt;Jirousek, Charlotte. “Islamic Clothing.” In Encyclopedia of Islam. New York: Macmillan Pub. (2004)[http://char.txa.cornell.edu/islamicclothes.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Flood, Finbarr Barry  (2009) Objects of Translation: Material Culture and Medieval &quot;Hindu-Muslim&quot; Encounter [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=OLNE_li8C10C&amp;pg=PA64&amp;dq=kurta+sind+iraq&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=qwCLVZ7COeHd7gawvoNo&amp;ved=0CDsQ6AEwBg#v=snippet&amp;q=trousers&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt; especially in the [[Punjab region]].

==Other areas==
The use of the suthan or the salwar has been adopted in other areas. People in [[Jammu]] have changed the traditional attire from the peshwaj (flowing to the ankles) &lt;ref&gt;Textiles,  Costumes and Ornaments of the Western Himalyas O Handa&lt;/ref&gt; to the kurta and Dogri suthan.  In addition to the traditional lengha choli, women in [[Sindh]] wear the cholo (kameez) and suthan.&lt;ref&gt;I am a Sindhi: The Glorious Sindhi Heritage and Culture and Folklore of Sindh J P Vaswami&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sindh and The Races That Inhabit the Valley of the Indus Richard F Burton&lt;/ref&gt; The Punjabi salwar suit is also worn by many people. The [[Phiran]] in [[Kashmir]]&lt;ref&gt;Paintings and lifestyles of Jammu Region: 17th to 19th Century A.D Raj Kumar&lt;/ref&gt; traditionally flowed to the ankles, is now of varying lengths and is worn with a loose suthan. [[Kashyap Bandhu]] is regarded as the person responsible for spreading the use of the suthan with the phiran amongst the communities that resisted to adopt its use, eventually leading to the use of the salwar.&lt;ref&gt;Cultural Heritage of India- Kashmiri Pandit Contribution.

Elsewhere in [[India]] and [[Pakistan]], Muslim communities have traditionally worn the style of salwar worn by the [[Mughals]] combining them with [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] upper garments such as the jamma. However, the Punjabi salwar suit is now worn by members of various communities in India&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=iY4bVR9--XAC&amp;pg=PA141&amp;dq=punjab+kurta+history&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=gph0VfTWNMPpUovugOgJ&amp;ved=0CE8Q6AEwBw#v=onepage&amp;q=punjab%20kurta%20history&amp;f=false Subba, J.R (2008) History, Culture and Customs of Sikkim]&lt;/ref&gt; and Pakistan.

The traditional male dress in Bangladesh is the lungi and kurta (also called Panjabi). Men also wear the Pathani suit. The traditional female dress is the sari but women also wear the Punjabi salwar suit.

[[Image:sweatpants.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Three boys wearing [[grey]] sweatpants.]]

'''Sweatpants''' are a [[casual]] variety of soft [[trousers]] intended for [[comfort]] or [[sportswear (activewear)|athletic]] purposes, although they are now worn in many different situations. In Britain, Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa they are known as '''[[tracksuit]] bottoms''' or '''jogging bottoms'''. In Australia, they are also commonly known as ''' trackpants''', '''trackies''' or '''tracky daks'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=In her tracky daks, a Hollywood star turns invisible|url=http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2002/10/24/1035416934724.html|accessdate=13 March 2013|newspaper=Sydney Morning Herald|date=25 October 2002|author=Lisa Pryor|language=|quote=Naomi Watts: 'I look like a completely different person when I just wake up and get my tracky daks on'}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The first pair of sweatpants was introduced in the 1920s by [[Émile Camuset]]. He was the founder of [[Le Coq Sportif]]. The sweatpants were simple knitted gray jersey pants that allowed athletes to stretch and run comfortably.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asicentral.com/news/magazines/wearables/novdec-2014/sweatpants-the-comfortable-choice/ |title= Sweatpants History: The Comfortable Choice |publisher=ASI|date=29 May 2007 |accessdate=30 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Design ==
Sweatpants are usually made from [[cotton]] or [[polyester]], often of a heavy knit. They often have elastic in the waist, and may or may not have pockets. Sweatpants are traditionally [[ash gray]] in color but are now available in most colors. They are usually quite &quot;baggy&quot; and loose, making  them easy to put on and take off; moreover they have flexibility and comfort. In addition, this design traps less heat than most conventional, lightweight trousers, which may be a disadvantage in some conditions such as cold [[temperature]]s and an advantage in others such as [[Thermoregulation|body heat]]-increasing [[aerobic exercise|aerobic]] activities. Warmer varieties can be made from [[polar fleece]].

Once these practical pants were only worn for sporting events and at home. Now, they are available in many fashionable styles and are worn in a variety of public situations. Because of their comfort and fashion, they have become a popular choice of clothing. The sweatpant variations described below are made from many different materials and in many forms.

== Variations ==
[[File:Woman fitness training.JPEG|thumb|Woman wearing tearaway pants]]
There are many variations on the sweatpant design that have evolved to define their own categories of athletic pants.  These variations include '''fashion pants''', '''windpants''', '''tearaway pants''', and '''muscle pants'''.

=== Fashion pants ===
'''Fashion pants''' typically refers to &quot;[[fashion]] conscious&quot; [[sportswear (activewear)|sportswear]]. These pants are often made from a variety of materials, like [[velvet]] or [[satin]], and in many color combinations or patterns. One distinguishing characteristic is that fashion pants generally lack the elastic band at the ankles.

=== Windpants ===
Windpants are similar to sweatpants but are lighter and shield the wearer from cold [[wind]] rather than insulate.  Windpants are typically made of polyester or [[nylon]], with a liner made of cotton or polyester. The nylon material's natural friction against both itself and human legs makes &quot;swooshing&quot; sounds during walking. Windpants often have zippers on each ankle, letting athletes unzip the end of each leg allowing the pants to be pulled over their footwear.

==={{visible anchor|Tearaway pants}}===
'''Tearaway pants''', also known as ''breakaway pants'', ''rip-off pants'', or (in the UK) ''popper pants'', are closely related to windpants.  Tearaway pants are windpants with [[snap fastener]]s running the length of  both legs. The snaps allow athletes to remove their tearaway pants in a timely manner to compete in some sports.  [[Basketball]] and [[track and field]] are the two sports most commonly associated with tearaway pants.

'''Rang Panchami''' is a [[festival]] celebrated 5 days after [[Holi]].

Holy_krishna: It is celebrated on the fifth day (Panchami) in the dark fortnight of the Hindu lunar month of Phalgun by throwing a red, fragrant powder (gulal) and splashing coloured water, etc. on others.

The fire, which shines with its brilliance on Holi, decomposes the raja-tama particles in the atmosphere and this helps activate various Deities in the form of colours. This bliss is celebrated by throwing colours in the air. Thus, Rang Panchami is a symbol of victory over raja-tama. Rang Panchami, played on Falgun Vadya Panchami involves invocation of Gods and is a part of worship of the manifest form of Gods. Its purpose is to activate the five elements of radiant manifest colours and to touch and feel the Deities who are attracted to the respective colours. These five elements are a source, which help activate the element of the Deities according to the spiritual emotion of the [[Jiva]]. Rang Panchami is the worship of the saviour form of the Deities.

Rang panchmi (“color fifth”) occurs on the fifth lunar day of the month of chet. Holi occurs on the first day of that month and is celebrated in villages (see “rural Madhya Pradesh, holi”). In small towns the main celebration occurs on panchmi. In the event documented here, a procession headed by a water tank with high pressure jet, two ceremonial cannons (firing paper), and a camel – organized by Brijesh Bohra – circumambulated the town dousing everyone on the street, and anyone visible in neighboring houses, with colored water. Bhang and alcohol intensify the heightened sensations of this exuberant communitas.

People of [[Maharashtra]] commonly know this festival of colours by the name of Rangpanchami as the play of colours is reserved for the fifth day here. Locals of Maharashtra also know Holi as Shimga or Shimgo. The festival is particularly popular amongst fisher folk. They celebrate it in on a large scale and revel in the festivities by singing, dancing and merry-making. This special dance provide them means to release all their repressed feelings, needs and desires. People also utter sound through their mouths in a peculiar fashion by striking their mouths with the back of their hands.

Ranga Panchami, or Rangpanchami, is colorfully celebrated on the fifth day after full moon in the month of Phalguna or Falgun. In 2015, the date of Rang Panchami is March 11. People play with colors on Rang Panchami day and it is observed five days after the popular Holi festival. Rangpanchami is more popular in Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh and in some parts of North India.
Rang means color and Panchami means the fifth day during a lunar fortnight.
The festival of Rangpanchami is also associated with Holi festival but is not very popular as it is more of a traditional festival and is limited to Maharashtra. Some people confuse Rang Panchami with the Holi festival that is celebrated with colors the day after the lighting of fires on the Phalgun Purnima day. The Rangpanchami festival is more closely associated with rural Marathi culture.

The 2016 date is March 28.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.drikpanchang.com/festivals/month/festivals-march.html?year=2016&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''college interview''' is a short&lt;ref&gt;Note: it usually lasts 20 minutes to an hour&lt;/ref&gt; face-to-face meeting, usually between a college admissions officer and a high school student applying for admission. It is one of several ways for a college to assess an applicant along with grade transcripts and standardized scores and essays.&lt;ref name=twsMay2S213&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Efinger advises students to write up their major achievements, organize them into themes, and have a three to five minute theme-oriented &quot;success story&quot; ready (but not memorized) before an interview, and suggests that interviewees should try to steer the conversation to show how their skills and experience meet criteria valued by the interviewer. For example, if trying to demonstrate an aptitude for &quot;planning and organization&quot;, he or she might show how they plan their schedule using their mobile scheduling app.

Advisers agree that a usual open-ended question to begin the interview will be along the lines of &quot;tell me about yourself&quot;, and that a student should be ready with a response.&lt;ref name=&quot;twsBuffaloSuntimes&quot;&gt;{{cite web
