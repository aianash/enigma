concept of holidays has most often originated in connection with religious observances the intention of a holiday was typically to allow individuals to tend to religious duties associated with important dates on the calendar in most modern societies however holidays serve as much of a recreational function as any other weekend days or activities in many societies there are important distinctions between holidays designated by governments and holidays designated by religious institutions for example in many predominantly christian nations government designed holidays may center on christian holidays though non christians may instead observe religious holidays associated with their faith in some cases a holiday may only be nominally observed for example many jews in the americas and europe treat the relatively minor jewish holiday of hanukkah as a working holiday changing very little of their daily routines for this day the word holiday has some variance in meaning across

levels of economic competition have been classified the most narrow form is direct competition also called category competition or brand competition where product business products which perform the same function compete against each other for example one brand of pick up trucks competes with several other brands of pick up trucks sometimes two companies are rivals and one adds new products to their line which leads to the other company distributing the same new things and in this manner they compete the next form is substitute or indirect competition where products which are close substitutes for one another compete for example butter competes with margarine mayonnaise and other various sauces and spreads the broadest form of competition is typically called budget competition included in this category is anything on which the consumer might want to spend their available income money for example a family which has available may choose to spend it on many different items which can all be seen as competing with each other for the family s expenditure this form of competition is also sometimes described as a competition of share of wallet in addition companies also compete for financing on the capital markets equity or debt in order to generate the necessary cash for their operations an investor typically will consider alternative investment opportunities given his risk profile and not only look at companies just competing on product direct competitors enlarging the investment universe to include indirect competitors leads to a broader peer universe of comparable indirectly competing companies competition does not necessarily have to be between companies for example business writers sometimes refer to internal competition this is competition within companies the idea was first introduced by alfred sloan at general motors corporation general motors in the s sloan deliberately created areas of overlap between divisions of the company so that each division would be competing with the other divisions for example the chevy division would compete with the pontiac division for some market segment s the competing brands by the same company allowed parts to be designed by one division and shared by several divisions for example parts designed by chevy would also be used by pontiac also in procter gamble initiated a deliberate system of internal brand versus brand rivalry the company was organized around different brand s with each brand allocated resources including a dedicated group of employees willing to champion the brand each brand manager was given responsibility for the success or failure of the brand and compensated accordingly finally most businesses also encourage competition between individual employees an example of this is a contest between sales representatives the sales representative with the highest sales or the best improvement in sales over a period of time would gain benefits from the employer this is also

times when african slaves and ship workers who were muslims arrived on the coast of saurashtra region saurashtra they adopted raas as their own and used african drum s while it originated from hindu tradition it was adopted by the muslim community as saurashtra singing entered the raas scene later on initially most songs were about lord krishna but songs about love praise of warriors who fought

extremely complicated and energetic both of these dances are associated with the time of harvest difference between dandiya and garba the main difference between garba and raas is that raas is played with dandiyas pair of colorfully decorated sticks while garba consists of various hand and feet movements most of the dandiya steps require even number of people while in garba there is no such requirement on number of people there are many popular dandiya songs available in gujarati and hindi br for dandiya sometimes instead of sticks people also use swords the circular movements of dandiya

south bihar in general it is the tradition that thekua which is the prasad offering to the god should be strictly prepared on mitti chulha traditional earthen stove by using clean wood sticks as the fuel this is religiously followed in north bihar whereas devotees in south bihar sometimes prepare the offering on gas stove depending on their comfort another difference which is observed is the number of consecutive years the puja is performed by a main worshiper in northern side of bihar the tradition is that if a person becomes the main worshiper he she must continue this for years plus year where the additional year is as sood interest however in south bihar this rule is quite flexible and there is no minimum limit on the number of consecutive years for which the puja should be

they make a great effort when they are given an assignment researching about the company makes sure that employees are not entirely clueless about the company they are applying for and at the end of the interview the interviewee might ask some questions to the interviewer about the company either to learn more information or to clarify on some points that they might have found during their research in any case it impresses the interviewer and it shows that the interviewee is willing to learn more about the company most interviewees also find that practising answering the most common questions asked in interviews helps them prepare for the real one it minimizes the chance of their being caught off guard regarding certain questions prepares their minds to convey the right

validation of an interview faking behavior scale journal of applied psychology ref thus faking in the employment interview is intentional deceptive and aimed at improving perceptions of performance faking in the employment interview can be broken down into four elements ref name levashina j the first involves the interviewee portraying him or herself as an ideal job candidate by exaggerating true skills tailoring answers to better fit the job and or creating the impression that personal beliefs values and attitudes are similar to those of the organization the second aspect of faking is inventing or completely fabricating one s image by piecing distinct work experiences together to create better answers inventing untrue experiences or skills and portraying others experiences or accomplishments as ones own thirdly faking might also be aimed at protecting the applicant s image this can be accomplished through omitting certain negative experiences concealing negatively perceived aspects of the applicant s background and by separating oneself from negative experiences the fourth and final component of faking involves ingratiating oneself to the interviewer by conforming personal opinions to align with those of the organization as well as insincerely praising or complimenting the interviewer or organization of all of the various faking behaviors listed ingratiation tactics were found to be the most prevalent in the employment interview while flat out making up answers or claiming others experiences as one s own is the least common ref name levashina

another interview or job offer increases when interviewees make up answers ref name levashina j different interview characteristics also seem to impact the likelihood of faking faking behavior is less prevalent for instance in past behavioral interviews than in situational interviews although follow up questions increased faking behaviors in both types of interviews therefore if practitioners are interested in decreasing faking behaviors among job candidates in employment interview settings they should utilize structured past behavioral interviews and avoid the use of probes or follow up

the applicants with disabilities reactions to the interview and applicant perceptions of the interviewers applicants with disabilities and able bodied applicants report similar feelings of anxiety towards an interview ref name duckett duckett p s disabling employment interviews warfare to work disability society ref applicants with disabilities often report that interviewers react nervously and insecurely which leads such applicants to experience anxiety and tension themselves the interview is felt to be the part of the selection process where covert discrimination against applicants with disabilities can occur ref name duckett many applicants with disabilities feel they cannot disclose i e inform potential employer of disability or discuss their disability because they want to demonstrate their abilities if the disability is visible then disclosure will inevitably occur when the applicant meets the interviewer so the applicant can decide if they want to discuss their disability if an applicant has a non visible disability however then that applicant has more of a choice in disclosing and discussing in addition applicants who were aware that the recruiting employer already had employed people with disabilities felt they had a more positive interview experience ref name duckett applicants should consider if they are comfortable with talking about and answering questions about their disability before deciding how to approach the interview research has also demonstrated that different types of disabilities have different effects on interview outcomes

that show there are no differences in interviewer responses to a brief shorter discussion or a detailed longer discussion about the disability during the interview ref name dalgin applicants however should note that when a non visible disability is disclosed near the end of the interview applicants were rated more negatively than early disclosing and non disclosing applicants therefore it is possible that interviewers feel individuals who delay disclosure may do so out of shame or embarrassment in addition if the disability is disclosed after being hired employers may feel deceived by the

positive effects however are preceded by the interviewers perception of the applicants psychological well being that is when the interviewer perceives the applicant is psychologically well and or comfortable with his or her disability there can be positive interviewer effects in contrast if the interviewer perceives the applicant as uncomfortable or anxious discussing the disability this may either fail to garner positive effect or result in more negative interview ratings for the candidate caution must again be taken when applying these research findings to other types of disabilities not investigated in the studies discussed above there are many factors that can influence the interview of an applicant with a disability such as whether the disability is physical or psychological

more common most stripes being vertical while horizontal stripes are a legitimate option herringbone patterns are worn informally and casually some colours such as purple or pink are generally only

classifications change very quickly and a worldwide or widely relevant discussion is impossible for women changes in fashion are more rapid in practical use dress codes are either followed intuitively or enforced by peer pressure so that people wear similar clothing in the same situations alternatively at more formal events where a dress code is specified invitees wear clothes at the specified level if some variation is permitted for example black tie preferred the host will wear the most formal option to save guests the embarrassment of out dressing him appropriate national dress is

flattering fit this new slimmed style allowed better movement and more of a functional fit without sacrificing modesty or tradition sweaters were made to fit close to the body for a tighter fit and the length was tapered very short to eliminate excess fabric overlapping the skirt often this caused the cheerleader s bare abdomen to be exposed during movement by now most sweaters were worn without any shirt or collared blouse beneath them different styles were incorporated to give squads more of a choice round neck and v neck sweaters were popular with squads seeking greater functionality as cheerleading was becoming more athletic instead of the standard vocal chant the new sweater styles allowed squads to eliminate the extra collared blouse beneath the sweater essentially just wearing

from a polyester blended fabric usually containing spandex as well the top without the sleeves are called shells if they have sleeves it is called a liner most american school squads wear a sleeveless top with either a sports bra or an athletic tank top underneath if the shell lacks sleeves many teams wear a turtle neck bodysuit under it although this is not required specifically the bodysuits can be either leotard like or covering only to the bottom of the ribcage due to guidelines imposed by the national federation of state high school associations national federation of high schools high school squads must have a top that covers their midriff with arms by their sides however if the arms are raised most uniforms will show a small section of midriff which is not against nfshsa rules most school sanctioned squads have modest looking uniform tops that are usually a waist length fit covering the whole frontal upper body except at the shoulders and arms when worn sleeveless likewise the back construction of most school cheerleading tops cover the full upper body however skin in the lower back area is mostly left uncovered if the cheerleader is sitting or bending this does not violate nfshsa uniform rules these requirements do not apply to all star cheerleading organizations therefore many have tops that stop at or just below the bottom of the bra line another growing trend among all star teams is having sections of material missing allowing bare skin to show across the top for the chest the shoulders the top of the back or portions of the arms the length of skirts has shortened dramatically with the average length for skirts at both high school and all star being to nbsp inches and lengths are shrinking every year however some coaches and various team sponsors encourage wearing shorter skirts due to safety reasons too much fabric can be dangerous while tumbling skirts are worn over top of colored or metallic color metallic spandex polyester briefs also

be customized to the length of the shell top either in a waist length design or a crop top style most squads prefer to wear bodysuits during competition as it creates a uniformed look in arm movements waist length shells can be worn with several styles of bodyliners in contrast to midriff shells which are limited to cropped stomach showing liners full coverage bodyliners worn under a waist length shell eliminate all midriff exposure during cheering a cropped liner worn under a waist length shell will cover the arms but leaves the stomach uncovered allowing midriff skin to still show just as if

often be customized by the school or team during the uniform ordering process the shell can either have a zipper closure in the back or side to aid in dressing or it can have a stretchy material that

camisole or it can be worn over top a bodysuit of choice or a simple turtleneck this is usually up to each squad s preference a shell top is available in many lengths and even in somewhat intricate style cues full shell usually sleeveless and having a simple style design it is normally waist length ending at the top of the skirt typically worn alone with a bra underneath this style top is worn by most american school squads as it is very modest and meets most dress codes with midriff exposure limited to bare lower backs and an inch of frontal skin while the arms are raised the sleeveless shell if worn alone will normally leave the arms and shoulders open a properly fitted shell top is essential in making the uniform look flattering for everyone on the cheer squad a shell that is properly sized and fitted will leave enough room around the arm openings for movement eliminating fabric rubbing against the underarms additionally if the shell is sized with the correct measurements the bottom of the hem should be long enough to meet the top of the skirt while standing stationary these tops can be highly customized from very ordinary to highly detailed designs certain cut outs in sections of the garment are an option as are varying hemlines for the bottom of the top for instance instead of a straight hem along the bottom of the top some squads will choose a cut up v hem which leaves an upside down v notch open along the front leaving slight midriff exposed at the belly button area this style is selected to allow for an additional color stripe along the bottom hem of the shell halter shell similar in style and length as a full fitting shell top but differing in the upper part of the garment this top is normally fully sleeveless and more revealing of the upper back the halter style normally includes a neck strap on the top that ties in the back crop top midriff this style of top is mostly used by colleges and out of school squads all star squads it is very revealing and rarely worn by high school squads due to dress code violations the top is typically worn sleeveless with only a bra underneath the school s or team s logo is featured in the center of the top the top ends right after the bra line leaving the entire midriff of the cheerleader showing the national federation of state high school associations nfhs instituted a rule against cropped uniform tops at the high school level most cheerleading governing bodies outlaw this top from being worn by public schools in competition however a few middle and high schools still choose to wear this style of top at their respective non competing events such as football games or parades there has been much debate on whether it is right to have a teenage girl wearing a garment like this at a public school as much of the body is revealed by this top skirt the bottom of a cheerleading uniform with matching colors and logo stripe design as the shell skirts can be very customizable with various styles of pleat designs or no pleats at all such as an a line skirt the general rule of length for skirts is mid thigh and can be sized simply by using the fingertip rule modern skirts are offered in various rises as well traditionally the skirt should be worn at the natural waistline at the navel area the traditional skirt should be high enough to touch the bottom of the shell slightly however some squads elect to wear low rise skirts either with longer shells or with a normal length shell creating a midriff look bundies must be worn under the skirt references reflist category cheerleading
